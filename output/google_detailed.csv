What follows is an adapted transcript of his speech.We\u2019re here today at a time of geopolitical change, a time when Europe faces growing competitiveness challenges.The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently appointed Mario Draghi to lead a special panel on European competitiveness\u2014looking at why European productivity is lagging, and how European leaders can reverse those trends, maintain a competitive edge, and pave the way for a new chapter of prosperity.A key element of regaining competitive momentum will be the race to harness leading-edge technologies like artificial intelligence.The technology race is often won not by the country that invents something first, but by the countries that deploy it best. And here Europe has a real chance to excel.Europe has an abundance of social innovators who are looking at new ways to tackle societal challenges. A few examples: Through our philanthropic arm Google.org we have supported organizations that are using AI to tackle environmental issues, fact-check misinformation, increase the impact of nonprofits, and find answers to age-old questions.\nGoogle team poses for a photo at the European Business Summit.\nThese stories show how Europe can help shape the future of AI, with a spirit of optimism about what it can deliver, and the abundance and scientific progress it can create.Of course many people also have concerns about how the technology may evolve. How do we work together to address those concerns?It\u2019s time to seize the opportunity of artificial intelligence boldly and responsibly, not just minimizing risk, but maximizing opportunity. After all, the biggest risk may be missing out on AI\u2019s potential.Getting AI right will take more than just one company or organization. As we outlined in our recent AI Opportunity Agenda, getting AI right won\u2019t happen by accident\u2013we\u2019ll need alignment from governments on frameworks and concrete actions. And we\u2019ll need educators, academics, civil society, and governments to step up and share ideas so that everyone benefits.In that spirit, today I have the honor of announcing that Google today is launching the Digital Futures Project in Europe.This project will support researchers, academics, and organizations creating research, analysis, and promoting debate on public policy solutions for the responsible development of AI in Europe.As part of the global Project, Google.org is committing \u20ac5 million to establish a fund, which will provide grants to leading nonprofit think tanks, civil society organizations and academic institutions, on both a national and European level.Inaugural European grantees include the Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques in France, Progressives Zentrum in Germany, think tank CEPS in Belgium, and the OdiseIA network spanning Southern and Northern Europe.These organizations are working on important questions like\u2026How will AI impact labor and the economy?How can we turbo-charge European innovation?What government and cross-industry efforts can promote research on responsible AI?How do we share the benefits of AI with everyone, even as we mitigate risks for vulnerable groups?We\u2019re keeping up momentum for these AI conversations because we know that bold and responsible are two sides of the same coin.After all, we've been at this for a while. In 2018 we published a set of AI Principles to guide our work because we believe companies have a duty to design and build these new technologies responsibly from the start.Tackling these challenges takes fundamental research, common standards, and aligned regulation based on shared democratic values.For example, to help address the challenge of misinformation, especially with 2024 EU elections coming up, we\u2019re working on technical innovations like our new SynthID watermarking tool for AI-generated images, and services to evaluate online information\u2013like the new \u201cAbout this Image\u201d feature in Google Search.This matters because context about the origin of content can help create a safer and more reliable information ecosystem.Beyond avoiding bias and misinformation, we will need to address the workforce transition. Even as workers become more productive, work will change.We\u2019ll need to support new approaches to primary and secondary education and expand private-public partnerships to upskill workers.As an example, since 2015, Google has trained 12 million people across Europe on digital skills through programs such as our Google Career Certificates\u2013and as we expand our work on AI, we\u2019re continuing to partner with governments and NGOs.Because for all the challenges, let\u2019s not forget that the potential of AI is vast.I\u2019ve worked in technology for most of my life\u2013and I\u2019ve never seen a time of more promise for the progress of science.Whether it\u2019s discovering new mRNA vaccines or creating world-class, sustainable manufacturing\u2013machine learning has the potential to benefit every person in Europe.\nIn total, Google.org will be sending five new teams of Google engineers via the Google.org Fellowship and providing funding and technical help to organizations across Europe through our \u20ac16M Tech for Social Good Impact Challenge.\nIn total, Google.org will be sending five new teams of Google engineers via the Google.org Fellowship and providing funding and technical help to organizations across Europe through our \u20ac16M Tech for Social Good Impact Challenge.\nIn total, Google.org will be sending five new teams of Google engineers via the Google.org Fellowship and providing funding and technical help to organizations across Europe through our \u20ac16M Tech for Social Good Impact Challenge.\nIn total, Google.org will be sending five new teams of Google engineers via the Google.org Fellowship and providing funding and technical help to organizations across Europe through our \u20ac16M Tech for Social Good Impact Challenge.\nNow a lot of recent attention on AI has focused on chatbots. But with the amount of computing power devoted to AI doubling every six months, we can expect to see AI turbocharge scientific discovery and drive faster work in areas ranging from sustainability to food security to neglected diseases.AI is bringing us \u201cscience at digital speed.\u201d Note that I said \u201cbringing,\u201d not \u201cwill bring\u201d\u2013that future is already here.Just one example: It used to take a biology graduate student a full doctoral thesis to discover the shape, the folds, of a single protein.DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold discovered the shapes of nearly every known protein\u2014a breakthrough that gave us the equivalent of nearly 400 million person years of scientific progress.That\u2019s like taking every man, woman, and child in Europe, training them to be a biology grad student, and having them do nothing but fold proteins for a full year.We made those results public, and now more than a million scientific researchers are using them to advance drug discovery and personalized medicine.Imagine similar advances in nuclear fusion, sustainability, clean water, precision agriculture, and more, and you start to get an idea of just how powerful, how transformative, and how productive this technology will be.And as productivity increases, so does competitiveness and economic growth.Let me quantify what I mean by that.A report commissioned by Google and released this year by Public First found generative AI could increase the size of the EU economy by \u20ac1.2 trillion, and save the average worker over 70 hours a year\u2014the equivalent to about two weeks of work. By helping everyone across the EU focus on more productive and creative tasks, AI can accelerate economic growth and in turn help us make progress on social challenges.Figures like those show that the countries most likely to lead in competitiveness will likely be the ones that are able to deploy AI and innovate with it at scale.Europe has a once in a generation chance to seize that potential opportunity. But it\u2019s not going to happen on its own. We need new legal and policy frameworks\u2014frameworks that have passed competitiveness checks, that nurture AI talent here in Europe, and that promote responsible AI innovation, access to new markets, and new investment.Technological leadership requires a balance between innovation and regulation. Not micromanaging progress, but holding actors responsible when they violate public trust.We\u2019ve long said that AI is too important not to regulate, and too important not to regulate well.The race should be for the best AI regulations, not the first AI regulations. Not looking for easy solutions, but making hard trade-offs, between security and openness, between data access and privacy, between explainability and accuracy.We\u2019ll need widespread regulatory expertise, since every agency is going to need to be an AI agency. And we\u2019ll need proportionate, risk-based rules that build on existing regulations and give businesses the confidence they need to keep investing in AI innovation.Let me be clear: There are real challenges ahead on topics like misinformation, discrimination, and the future of work. But we\u2019re making real progress on all fronts\u2014there\u2019s never been a challenge that humanity couldn\u2019t find a way to address.And maybe that\u2019s the right note to end on.When I was a kid in the United States, Star Trek talked about space as \u201cthe final frontier.\u201dBut I don\u2019t believe it: Science is an endless frontier. With risk, but also with boundless opportunity.AI can not only address our hardest social challenges and solve problems on the frontiers of science, but it can also promote European, and democratic, geopolitical influence and competitive advantage.We are encouraged to see governments stepping up: Singapore\u2018s AI Verify effort, the UK\u2019s pro-innovation framework, the US Executive Order, the G7\u2019s Hiroshima Process, and of course the EU AI Act and the EU-US Trade and Technology Council meetings.When we look back on 2023, we may see it as a defining year in Europe\u2019s AI journey.As I said at the start of my talk, the countries that take advantage of this technology boldly and responsibly today are the ones that will maximize productivity and competitiveness tomorrow.Each country, each region, needs to ask itself, \u201cWhat is our digital strategy?\u201dNot just our cyber-strategy to defend, but our digital strategy to succeed.We owe it to each other to get this right\u2013through global, pro-innovation frameworks and affirmative policy agendas that maximize opportunity.We look forward to working with leading thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic to build bold and responsible AI tools that benefit everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2023-11-17 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "Key takeaways from the Search trial", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/key-takeaways-from-the-search-trial/", "post_text": "This week, our trial with the Department of Justice and State Attorneys General came to an end. After 10 weeks, the evidence confirms what we\u2019ve said all along: People have many choices when searching for information online, and they use Google because it\u2019s helpful.Here are our key takeaways from the trial:Our success is due to our constant commitment to innovation and quality.Throughout the trial, we heard testimony on the many ways Google constantly innovates in Search to create a better experience for our users. As our VP of Search Quality, Pandu Nayak, said on the stand, \u201cthere\u2019s no sense that Search has ever been good enough.\u201d That\u2019s why we invest billions in R&D every year and have pioneered advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. By comparison, Microsoft\u2019s CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that Microsoft\u2019s \u201cfailure to make capital expenditures to support its search business\u201d was not because they lacked the resources, and that in 2018, Google Search\u2019s engineering team was five times bigger than Bing\u2019s. And DuckDuckGo\u2019s CEO testified that it has distributed capital to shareholders several times, rather than investing in improving its search engine.Our investment in mobile was the right call at the right time.Our former VP of Search, Ben Gomes, testified that in 2007, our founders instructed a \u201cmobile-only\u201d approach to innovating and improving Search. The Court heard how this was a gamble, since mobile queries were a small fraction of total queries and the vast majority of searches still occurred on desktop. Google\u2019s investments and innovations to advance mobile computing and Search on mobile devices \u2014 including the launch of the open-source Android operating system and the Android mobile application distribution and revenue share agreements \u2014 made us the most attractive partner to mobile device makers like Samsung. As our CEO Sundar Pichai testified, these companies wanted to give their users \u201cessential out-of-the-box functionality.\u201d By contrast, a Microsoft executive testified that they did not even launch a mobile browser until 2017 and failed in various efforts to develop a competitive mobile platform.We compete for promotion to make Search easily accessible, but people can easily find alternatives.As Sundar said, \u201cWe want to make it very, very seamless and easy for users to use our service.\u201d We compete for promotional opportunities so people can easily access Search and so that people search more. Our revenue-sharing payments have increased over time because people are searching more with Google, enjoying the benefits of incredible innovations in our partners\u2019 mobile devices and browsers. But just being the default does not guarantee success, because users know how to find the alternatives they prefer. For example, even though Microsoft preloads Edge and Bing, and puts up obstacles to switching, the large majority of Windows users search with Google. Satya Nadella testified that Bing\u2019s share of search queries on Windows is \u201cin the teens.\u201d We also learned that when Bing was the default on Blackberry and Windows Mobile mobile devices, the majority of searches still went to Google. Mozilla\u2019s CEO, Mitchell Baker, testified that when they changed the default on Firefox to Yahoo!, \u201cwe found our users trying all sorts of different ways to get back to Google, and we experienced lots of people leaving Firefox.\u201dOur partners choose us because they say we\u2019re the best.Apple\u2019s Eddy Cue testified: \u201cWhen we were doing the deal with Google, we wanted the capabilities to provide the best \u2014 the best service, the best application, the best thing for customers. Google was the best one.\u201d Mozilla\u2019s Mitchell Baker said, \u201cOur users made it clear that they look for and want and expect Google, and that when they get Google Search results and Google as the default, that\u2019s what they expect, and they\u2019re happy.\u201d And Motorola\u2019s Erik Christensen agreed that preloading Chrome and Google Search on Motorola phones was in the \u201cbest interest of\u2026its consumers.\u201dGoogle has many competitors, not just general search engines.Evidence at trial shows we face fierce competition from a broad range of competitors \u2014 from specialized search engines like Expedia, Angi and Yelp to social-media firms like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. As Prabhakar Raghavan, our SVP of Knowledge and Information, said, \u201cWe feel ourselves competing with them every day.\u201d Economist Dr. Mark Israel testified that \u201ceach query made by a user is a meaningfully distinct choice about where to go [to] get information. Amazon competes for shopping queries, Expedia competes for travel queries and Yelp competes for local queries.\u201d We compete for all of these queries and innovate every day so users will choose Google for their information needs.Scale is not nearly the whole story.Experts and our top engineers testified the DOJ overstates the value of click-and-query data.Several of our top engineers testified that there are many important aspects of search quality that require little or no click-and-query data, including recent innovations in large language models and building a comprehensive index of the web. (In fact, Microsoft\u2019s head of search and advertising testified that one of Bing\u2019s major challenges was that its web index has historically been far smaller than Google\u2019s and didn\u2019t invest in expanding it until 2019.) And the founder of Neeva testified that he believed one only needs 2.5% of users to have a competitive general search engine.When the DOJ filed their lawsuit over three years ago, we said its case was deeply flawed. Over the last ten weeks, we presented the facts to back this up. We appreciate the opportunity to tell our side of the story and look forward to continuing to make our case in the post-trial proceedings.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Our AI efforts will need to include both guardrails to mitigate potential risks and initiatives to maximize progress \u2014 promoting economic productivity and solving big social challenges. Let\u2019s focus not only on harms to avoid and risks to mitigate, but on opportunities to seize. This AI Opportunity Agenda offers a blueprint for investing in AI infrastructure, readying the workforce for the AI-enhanced jobs of tomorrow, and promoting widespread AI adoption. We\u2019re confident these new scientific discoveries and engineering innovations will lead to greater abundance for all of us.\nLet\u2019s focus not only on harms to avoid and risks to mitigate, but on opportunities to seize.\n1. Investing in AI infrastructure and enabling innovation\nGovernments and the private sector have a critical role to play in ensuring that researchers, technologists, and businesses have access to the tools needed to research, build, and deploy AI, including cloud infrastructure, compute capacity, and data.A few steps they can and should take immediately include advancing pro-innovation legal frameworks, establishing a Global Resource for AI Research (akin to the National AI Research Resource in the US but on a bigger scale), and putting in place strong trade and investment policies that allow for international collaboration on AI, including cross-border data flows that will enhance the capability of partners to work together to make sure AI systems are trained on demographically and geographically diverse datasets.\n2. Building human capital and an AI-ready workforce\nAI presents immense opportunities to catapult economies forward through increased productivity and economic activity that can benefit everyone. But we know that AI can also be a disruptive force. Industry, civil society, and policymakers will have to work together to prepare the workforce for the AI-powered job transition.One way they could do that is by creating a global AI Corps to build an AI-ready workforce by extending AI training programs to communities, while helping workers impacted by AI get the skills needed to quickly bounce back to new and better jobs.Governments should also incorporate AI as a core component of education, create flexible immigration pathways for AI experts, and establish a safety net with an AI adjustment assessment program with tailored skilling programs. Senator Cantwell\u2019s proposed \u201cGI Bill for AI\u201d in the U.S. and Singapore\u2019s nationwide AI skilling initiative could serve as strong models for these types of global skilling programs.\n3. Maximizing AI accessibility and adoption\nTechnology competitions are often won \u2013 not by the first to invent \u2013 but by the best to deploy. In order to harness the potential of AI, it must be universally accessible and useful. Governments, working closely with the private sector and civil society, can advance this goal by adopting AI to enhance public services and by helping small businesses access AI.As a first step, governments will need to build more AI expertise themselves. Policymakers should build and scale up \u201cin-house\u201d AI skilling for their IT workforce (similar to how we required all software engineers to enroll in an internal machine-learning curriculum at Google). They should also consider creative ways to bring in private-sector talent, such as an AI Fellows program modeled on the Presidential Innovation Fellows program and the UK\u2019s Government Digital Service. Finally, while every agency will need some AI expertise, governments should consider establishing a centralized resource of experts that can advise agencies across the government.Looking beyond the public sector, we can help small businesses adopt AI by providing digital coaches and training to underserved communities through programs like the Small Business AI Innovation and Commercialization Institutes (contemplated in the recent U.S. executive order). On top of that, low-interest loan and grant programs can improve access to the capital needed to spur adoption more widely.\nFinal thoughts\nAs AI advances, it will only become more important for public and private stakeholders to come together to pursue an opportunity agenda that harnesses AI\u2019s potential in medicine, precision agriculture, economic productivity, and much more. We look forward to partnering with governments and civil society on this project so we can build an AI-driven future that works for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAI\n  "}

However, smartphones have also become a primary attack vector for an increasing number of criminals, who are expanding their efforts to defraud users through mobile financial scams and malicious apps.Android\u2019s top priority is the safety of its users, and we continuously combat emerging security threats and financial scams with robust, multi-layered defenses. Google Play Protect, our built-in malware defense, is the most widely deployed mobile threat protection service in the world, scanning 125 billion apps a day. And it works hand in hand with other protections, like spam and phishing protection in Messages and Gmail, to help protect your data.As users trust their phones with more sensitive information, we recognized that collaboration with the technology community, in addition to the latest protections, is essential to addressing growing financial fraud and security threats. To celebrate International Fraud Awareness Week, here's a look at how we've been partnering around the world to tackle fraud and improve mobile security.Working together to raise awareness and educate usersDuring Cybersecurity Awareness Month in October, we worked even closer with governments, the banking industry and other organizations. Our goal is to raise awareness of mobile security best practices and work jointly on education efforts to help keep mobile users safe.\nIn Brazil, the Stop and Think: It Could Be a Scam campaign helps educate users on the dangers of scams and fraud.\nIn Brazil, we\u2019re working closely with Febraban, the Brazilian federation of national banks, to support their safety campaign \"Stop and Think: It Could Be a Scam.\u201d The campaign is designed to help people avoid scams and stay ahead of attackers. We\u2019re investing to expand the reach of the campaign and bring it to more Android users throughout Brazil.This builds on our work earlier this year to educate financial institutions on how to protect against scams. During our Play Security Day in August, we invited 18 banks, including Febraban, to an immersion program on fraud prevention and security solutions focused on financial apps.\nThe #31Days31Tips campaign uses fun, bite-sized tips to help Thai people stay safe online.\nIn Thailand, we worked with the Bank of Thailand and Thailand Banking Sector Computer Emergency Response Team (TB-CERT) to help launch the #31Days31Tips campaign aimed at helping Thai people stay safe online through a series of short, fun pieces of advice. Each day, the three organizations released practical safety pointers to help people secure their online accounts, stay away from scams, spot misinformation and safeguard their online privacy.\nAndroid product director Rae Wang discussed Android security at Singapore International Cyber Week\nIn Singapore, we participated in Singapore International Cyber Week to educate people on our Android defenses and share a new toolkit for users to help spot and fight financial fraud. During Cyber Week, we also organized a forum with close to 60 C-level executives of financial services companies. We shared our efforts in combating scams and the tools we have in place that can help prevent malicious mobile security attacks. In an effort to engage government agencies to build their capabilities in fighting scams, we also provided a hands-on technical session to help identify opportunities to improve detection, technical analysis and response capabilities.\nGoogle launched DigiKavach in India to help develop new countermeasures against scammers\nIn India, we are coordinating with government agencies to address financial fraud while launching our own initiatives to address pressing issues. At Google for India, we announced DigiKavach, a new program that studies scamming methods and develops and implements new countermeasures with partners. As part of this effort, we have partnered with the industry, including the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment to help us combat predatory lending apps on Play in India.Uniting to protect Android users around the worldWe believe collaboration is essential to protect users from mobile security threats and fraud. We are committed to partnering with governments, partners and other stakeholders to improve user protections and educate users about how to stay safe. We are constantly improving our detections and capabilities, and we look forward to continuing to work across the industry to make the Android ecosystem more secure for users.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

The first sought to exploit public enthusiasm for generative AI to spread malware. The second weaponized the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) to harm their business competitors by submitting thousands of blatantly fraudulent copyright notices.Keeping you safe online is core to our business. Every day, Gmail blocks over 100 million phishing attempts, Safe Browsing protects over 5 billion devices, and Google Play scans over 100 billion apps. For the latest scams, lawsuits are an effective tool for establishing a legal precedent, disrupting the tools used by scammers, and raising the consequences for bad actors. And over the years, we\u2019ve proactively pursued litigation to stop scammers who exploit the vulnerable, trick small businesses and attempt to extort our users.Protecting users from AI scammersAs public excitement in new generative AI tools has increased, scammers are increasingly taking advantage of unsuspecting users. Our first lawsuit targets bad actors who misled numerous people around the world looking to use Google\u2019s AI tools into unknowingly downloading malware. The fraudsters created social media pages and ran ads that encouraged people to \u201cdownload\u201d Bard, our freely available generative AI tool that does not need to be downloaded. The ads instead led people to download malware that compromised their social media accounts. Since April, we have filed roughly 300 takedowns related to this group of bad actors.We are seeking an order to stop the scammers from setting up domains like these and allow us to have them disabled with U.S. domain registrars. If this is successful, it will serve as a deterrent and provide a clear mechanism for preventing similar scams in the future.Combatting the weaponization of copyright lawOur second lawsuit targets bad actors abusing the DMCA by using bogus copyright takedowns to harm competitors. The DMCA was created to protect internet users and copyright holders, while encouraging innovation. It enables creators to protect their work on the Internet, ensures users and businesses can create and share information online, and gives companies the certainty they need to offer services to the public. In compliance with the DMCA, Google has a takedown process to handle legitimate complaints of copyright infringement.Our lawsuit targets bad actors who set up dozens of Google accounts and used them to submit thousands of bogus copyright claims against their competitors. These fraudulent claims resulted in removal of over 100,000 businesses\u2019 websites, costing them millions of dollars and thousands of hours in lost employee time.We hope our lawsuit will not only put an end to this activity, but also deter others and raise awareness of the harm that fraudulent takedowns can have on small businesses across the country.Protecting our users, setting legal precedent and bringing scammers to justiceToday\u2019s actions are part of our ongoing legal strategy to protect consumers and small businesses, and establish needed legal precedents in emerging fields of innovation. Clear rules against frauds, scams, and harassment are important \u2014 no matter how novel the setting \u2014 and we're committed to doing our part to protect the people who use the internet from abuse.More broadly, we hope these efforts protect and preserve the unprecedented culture of innovation in the United States. Just as AI fraudsters and copyright scammers hope to fly under the radar \u2014 we believe that appropriate legal action and working with government officials puts scammers squarely in the crosshairs of justice, promoting a safer internet for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAI\n  \nSmall Business\n  \nSafety & Security\n  "}
{"date": "2023-11-10 12:00:00+00:00", "title": "Google at APEC 2023", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-at-apec-2023/", "post_text": "Next week, leaders from government, civil society and the business community will gather in San Francisco for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Week. This year\u2019s theme \u2013 \u201ccreating a resilient and sustainable future for all\u201d \u2013 could not be more timely, as new advances in artificial intelligence will revolutionize how the world addresses its biggest challenges, drive economic growth, and unleash new opportunities in APEC economies and around the world.Google is a strong supporter of APEC and its mission of creating greater prosperity for the region by promoting growth and accelerating regional integration. Just last month, for example, we announced a partnership with the governments of Australia, the United States, Fiji, French Polynesia and the Pacific Island nations to build two new transpacific subsea cables to increase digital connectivity across the Pacific \u2014 and we\u2019re excited to build on these partnerships at APEC next week.Connectivity and sustainability in the Asia-PacificThe partnership behind the two new subsea cables reinforced the promise of bringing AI to traditionally underrepresented communities and enabling everyone to access its incredible promise. This starts, of course, with connectivity. 2.6 billion people today are not connected to the internet, including over a billion people in the Asia-Pacific region.State-of-the-art infrastructure like these subsea cables and the data centers that we\u2019re building across the region are critical enablers of AI-led growth \u2013 notably, without governments having to bear the costs traditionally associated with major infrastructure projects.It's critical that this infrastructure growth be undertaken responsibly with an eye to its energy usage and carbon footprint. That\u2019s why we set a goal to operate our data centers and campuses on carbon-free energy, 24 hours a day, by 2030. And through Google.org, we\u2019ve supported 13 local organizations via the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network's APAC Sustainability Seed Fund. These organizations are using AI and technology to develop sustainability solutions for vulnerable and underserved communities in Asia-Pacific.AI\u2019s economic and workforce promiseWe also think AI has the ability to accelerate economic growth in APEC countries, and that governments and businesses can work together to make it happen. According to Goldman Sachs, AI could boost annual productivity growth over the next decade by 1.5%, and increase annual global GDP by 7% longer term. The impact of such super-charged growth on human welfare is enormous \u2013 potentially lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty and improving billions of lives.At the same time, governments and industry will need to work together to help workers gain new skills, businesses to adapt, and schools to use AI for personalized learning. We\u2019re committed to helping people prepare for in-demand jobs through skilling and training. We\u2019ve added free online courses on generative AI for both technical and non-technical audiences. This year alone, we\u2019ve given over 100,000 Google Career Certificate scholarships to expand the cyber workforce in the Asia-Pacific region. Google.org also provided $15 million to The Asia Foundation to launch the APAC Cyber Security Fund to bolster cyber capabilities of 300,000 underserved small businesses, nonprofits and social enterprises. And through our Digital Futures Project, we\u2019re supporting academics and think tanks around the world researching AI\u2019s impact on the economy and future of work.Consistent regulatory approachThe issue that we most frequently get asked by most governments in the APEC region is how to ensure their economies are at the forefront of the AI revolution and don\u2019t get left behind. The answer: sound public policy. Governments are rightly thinking about AI governance, and making progress on global frameworks to mitigate potential risks. To fully harness the AI opportunity, a coordinated, risk-based and globally interoperable approach to regulation is key. Regulatory fragmentation makes it more difficult for businesses of all sizes to provide cross-border services and technologies, and mostly hurts small businesses who have fewer resources to comply with a web of conflicting regulations.APEC has traditionally played a catalytic role in fostering international trade norms, and is well-positioned to drive a consistent approach to governing cross-border technologies like AI. For example, APEC could convene governments to discuss how they can make AI more accessible with policies and investments to spur research and development, develop talent, and adopt cloud infrastructure and compute capacity. And it could promote consistent legal and regulatory frameworks that spur innovation and enable trusted cross-border data flows.We look forward to engaging with governments, businesses and civil society from the APEC economies to make the most of AI\u2019s potential to solve big challenges, create more opportunities for more people, and drive unprecedented growth.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Epic Games has fought a global, years-long campaign to up-end this system all in the hope of getting something for nothing. They have already sued Apple and lost twice. Next week they are trying their luck with Android by bringing a case that has even less merit given the flexibility and choices Android offers.Epic argues that it is forced to distribute its apps through Google Play and that options available to developers are too restrictive. These claims are baseless. Android enables developers to distribute through multiple app stores or directly to users through the web, bypassing app stores altogether. The truth is that Epic simply wants all the benefits that Android and Google Play provide without having to pay for them. And it wants to strip away critical security and privacy protections that keep billions of users safe from things like unfair subscription practices and dishonest billing, for which Epic itself has faced record fines.Here\u2019s more detail about the facts at the heart of this case:Google Play competes fairly for users and developers. At trial, Epic will argue that Google Play doesn\u2019t compete with the Apple App Store. This is obviously not true \u2014 and it\u2019s a theory that courts have rejected. Android competes with Apple\u2019s iOS and the iPhone, and Google Play competes intensely with the App Store for both consumers and developers. We also compete with other Android app stores, including the Samsung Galaxy Store and Amazon Appstore, as well as app stores on gaming consoles and PCs. We\u2019ve worked to attract developers through efforts like our Games Velocity Program, which offered developers incentives to launch their apps on Play alongside other competing stores such as the Apple App Store. Contrary to Epic\u2019s false characterization, this program did not require exclusivity on Play or prevent developers from opening their own app stores.Developers have many ways to distribute their apps on Android. Epic also claims that developers have no other choice than to distribute their apps through Google Play. That\u2019s not true either. Android is the only major mobile platform that gives developers multiple ways to distribute apps. In fact, most Android devices come preloaded with two or more app stores right out of the box \u2014 and users can install others if they want. Developers can also distribute their apps directly to their users. Epic takes full advantage of Android\u2019s distribution options by making their most popular app, Fortnite, available for billions of Android users around the world to download through the Samsung Galaxy Store and directly through their website. This choice and flexibility is possible only on Android.We provide a wide range of tools and services, not just payment processing. Epic would like you to believe the only value Google Play provides is payment processing, and that that\u2019s the only thing we should charge for. The truth is Google Play invests heavily in supporting all developers big and small across every stage of an app\u2019s journey, providing an array of tools and services to help them grow their businesses and acquire, engage and keep users. These investments mean developers can choose the business models that work for them which, in turn, creates more choice for customers. Plus, Google Play\u2019s ongoing investment in safety features and platform improvements creates a trusted environment \u2014 one where people can explore a range of new apps with confidence while also discovering new developers.Google Play\u2019s fees are the lowest of any major app store. We fund our investments in the ecosystem in part through a service fee that applies only when a developer on Google Play sells in-app digital goods or services. This is a sensible model: We make money only when a developer does, so our success is aligned with theirs and we are incentivized to improve the platform for developers. While Epic argues our fees are too high, Google Play\u2019s fees are actually the lowest among major app stores. In fact, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. This fee structure also avoids higher up-front charges that would burden small developers. This flexibility has led to a rapid increase in digital transactions, particularly in gaming apps like Fortnite, where the \u201cfreemium\u201d model has become very popular among game developers.Google Play is the only mobile platform offering users choice in payments. Though Epic claims consumers are forced to use Google Play\u2019s billing system, that\u2019s again not true. We\u2019re piloting a system on Google Play where users choose between Google Play\u2019s billing system and a system of the developer\u2019s choosing when they purchase in-app digital goods and services. User choice billing includes a standard fee to ensure that we can maintain Android\u2019s safe and secure experience when purchasing in apps. Today this option is live in more than 35 countries, and we are committed to working with Android developers to iterate and improve the program while keeping users safe and protected. Of course, when downloaded from a competing app store or directly from a developer\u2019s website, users pay with the developer or app store\u2019s billing system of choice.This lawsuit risks making Android less safe. Users expect a safe experience on Android, and we are committed to keeping our users safe even while giving them choice. For example, when someone downloads an app for the first time directly from a developer\u2019s website, Android notifies the user and asks them to verify they are doing so intentionally. We do this to ensure that users understand the risks of downloading software onto their mobile device directly from the web. We\u2019ve streamlined this user prompt to make it a seamless, simple process. However, Epic wants these user notifications removed entirely, leaving the three billion people around the world who rely on these security precautions uninformed and putting their security and privacy at risk.Android\u2019s choice and flexibility work well for consumers and developers of all sizes. We look forward to making our case in court as we fight to keep our users safe from harm, partner with developers to grow their businesses, and keep the Android ecosystem thriving and healthy for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAndroid\n  \nGoogle Play\n  "}

That\u2019s why we have a long history of supporting collective security through our Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP), Project Zero and in the field of Open Source software security. It\u2019s also why we joined other leading AI companies at the White House earlier this year to commit to advancing the discovery of vulnerabilities in AI systems.Today, we\u2019re expanding our VRP to reward for attack scenarios specific to generative AI. We believe this will incentivize research around AI safety and security, and bring potential issues to light that will ultimately make AI safer for everyone. We\u2019re also expanding our open source security work to make information about AI supply chain security universally discoverable and verifiable.New technology requires new vulnerability reporting guidelinesAs part of expanding VRP for AI, we\u2019re taking a fresh look at how bugs should be categorized and reported. Generative AI raises new and different concerns than traditional digital security, such as the potential for unfair bias, model manipulation or misinterpretations of data (hallucinations). As we continue to integrate generative AI into more products and features, our Trust and Safety teams are leveraging decades of experience and taking a comprehensive approach to better anticipate and test for these potential risks. But we understand that outside security researchers can help us find, and address, novel vulnerabilities that will in turn make our generative AI products even safer and more secure. In August, we joined the White House and industry peers to enable thousands of third-party security researchers to find potential issues at DEF CON\u2019s largest-ever public Generative AI Red Team event. Now, since we are expanding the bug bounty program and releasing additional guidelines for what we\u2019d like security researchers to hunt, we\u2019re sharing those guidelines so that anyone can see what\u2019s \u201cin scope.\u201d We expect this will spur security researchers to submit more bugs and accelerate the goal of a safer and more secure generative AI.Two new ways to strengthen the AI Supply ChainWe introduced our Secure AI Framework (SAIF) \u2014 to support the industry in creating trustworthy applications \u2014 and have encouraged implementation through AI red teaming. The first principle of SAIF is to ensure that the AI ecosystem has strong security foundations, and that means securing the critical supply chain components that enable machine learning (ML) against threats like model tampering, data poisoning, and the production of harmful content.Today, to further protect against machine learning supply chain attacks, we\u2019re expanding our open source security work and building upon our prior collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation. The Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST) is leveraging SLSA and Sigstore to protect the overall integrity of AI supply chains. SLSA involves a set of standards and controls to improve resiliency in supply chains, while Sigstore helps verify that software in the supply chain is what it claims to be. To get started, today we announced the availability of the first prototypes for model signing with Sigstore and attestation verification with SLSA.These are early steps toward ensuring the safe and secure development of generative AI \u2014 and we know the work is just getting started. Our hope is that by incentivizing more security research while applying supply chain security to AI, we\u2019ll spark even more collaboration with the open source security community and others in industry, and ultimately help make AI safer for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nAI\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

McGovern Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, Eric Schmidt, and Jaan Tallinn commit over $10 million for a new AI Safety Fund to advance research into the ongoing development of the tools for society to effectively test and evaluate the most capable AI models.October 25, 2023 - Today, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are announcing the selection of Chris Meserole as the first Executive Director of the Frontier Model Forum, and the creation of a new AI Safety Fund, a more than $10 million initiative to promote research in the field of AI safety. The Frontier Model Forum, an industry body focused on ensuring safe and responsible development of frontier AI models, is also releasing its first technical working group update on red teaming to share industry expertise with a wider audience as the Forum expands the conversation about responsible AI governance approaches.Executive DirectorChris Meserole comes to the Frontier Model Forum with deep expertise on technology policy, having worked extensively on the governance and safety of emerging technologies and their future applications. Most recently he served as Director of the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative at the Brookings Institution.In this new role, Meserole will be responsible for helping the Forum fulfill its mission to (i) advance AI safety research to promote responsible development of frontier models and minimize potential risks, (ii) identify safety best practices for frontier models, (iii) share knowledge with policymakers, academics, civil society and others to advance responsible AI development; and (iv) support efforts to leverage AI to address society\u2019s biggest challenges.\"The most powerful AI models hold enormous promise for society, but to realize their potential we need to better understand how to safely develop and evaluate them. I\u2019m excited to take on that challenge with the Frontier Model Forum.\" - Chris MeseroleAI Safety FundOver the past year, industry has driven significant advances in the capabilities of AI. As those advances have accelerated, new academic research into AI safety is required. To address this gap, the Forum and philanthropic partners are creating a new AI Safety Fund, which will support independent researchers from around the world affiliated with academic institutions, research institutions, and startups. The initial funding commitment for the AI Safety Fund comes from Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, and the generosity of our philanthropic partners, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation*, Eric Schmidt, and Jaan Tallinn. Together this amounts to over $10 million in initial funding. We are expecting additional contributions from other partners.Earlier this year, the members of the Forum signed on to voluntary AI commitments at the White House, which included a pledge to facilitate third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities in our AI systems. The Forum views the AI Safety Fund as an important part of fulfilling this commitment by providing the external community with funding to better evaluate and understand frontier systems. The global discussion on AI safety and the general AI knowledge base will benefit from a wider range of voices and perspectives.The primary focus of the Fund will be supporting the development of new model evaluations and techniques for red teaming AI models to help develop and test evaluation techniques for potentially dangerous capabilities of frontier systems. We believe that increased funding in this area will help raise safety and security standards and provide insights into the mitigations and controls industry, governments, and civil society need to respond to the challenges presented by AI systems.The Fund will put out a call for proposals within the next few months. Meridian Institute will administer the Fund \u2014 their work will be supported by an advisory committee comprised of independent external experts, experts from AI companies, and individuals with experience in grantmaking.Technical ExpertiseOver the last few months the Forum has worked to help establish a common set of definitions of terms, concepts, and processes so we have a baseline understanding to build from. This way researchers, governments, and other industry peers are all able to have the same starting point in discussions about AI safety and governance issues.In support of building a common understanding, the Forum is also working to share best practices on red teaming across the industry. As a starting point, the Forum has come together to produce a common definition of \u201cred teaming\u201d for AI and a set of shared case studies in a new working group update. We defined red teaming as a structured process for probing AI systems and products for the identification of harmful capabilities, outputs, or infrastructural threats. We will build on this work and are committed to work together to continue our red teaming efforts.We are also developing a new responsible disclosure process, by which frontier AI labs can share information related to the discovery of vulnerabilities or potentially dangerous capabilities within frontier AI models \u2014\u00a0and their associated mitigations. Some Frontier Model Forum companies have already discovered capabilities, trends, and mitigations for AI in the realm of national security. The Forum believes that our combined research in this area can serve as a case study for how frontier AI labs can refine and implement a responsible disclosure process moving forward.What\u2019s NextOver the coming months, the Frontier Model Forum will establish an Advisory Board to help guide its strategy and priorities, representing a range of perspectives and expertise. Future releases and updates, including updates about new members, will come directly from the Frontier Model Forum \u2014 so stay tuned to their website for further information.The AI Safety Fund will issue its first call for proposals in the coming months, and we expect grants to be issued shortly after.The Frontier Model Forum will also be issuing additional technical findings as they become available.The Forum is excited to work with Meserole and to deepen our engagements with the broader research community, including the Partnership on AI, MLCommons, and other leading NGOs and government and multi-national organizations to help realize the benefits of AI while promoting its safe development and use.*The David and Lucile Packard Foundation intends to provide support, but funding had not yet been formally committed at the time of distribution.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

We take seriously our responsibility to promote positive online experiences, and we support regulatory approaches that promote both online safety and balanced practices.That\u2019s why today we\u2019re releasing our Legislative Framework to Protect Children and Teens Online. The Framework outlines some principles for laws seeking to improve online experiences and keep children and teens safer when using the internet. We hope that sharing our experiences and perspectives will advance the work of the policymakers and experts addressing these issues, and we look forward to engaging constructively with them.Improving protections for familiesOnline services need to deliver age-appropriate features and services and be designed with safety in mind. Google is continually working on industry-leading protections \u2014 whether expanding options for parents in Family Link on YouTube, not personalizing advertising to children and teens, blurring adult or graphic violent content in Search results by default, or setting defaults that support digital wellbeing. And we are committed to evolving our practices and approaches with input from diverse stakeholders. In fact, just today YouTube announced five principles that are core to its work to create a better environment for young people.We agree with public health and mental health experts that technology companies have a responsibility to design and build better online experiences. We are encouraged by the increased global interest in ensuring that online services address risks to children and teens.Good legislative models \u2014 like those based on age-appropriate design principles \u2014 can help hold companies responsible for promoting safety and privacy, while enabling access to richer experiences for children and teens.Of course, as policymakers contemplate these issues, they should carefully consider the broader impacts of these bills and avoid side effects like blocking access to critical services, requiring people (including adults) to submit unnecessary identification or sensitive personal information, or treating an older teen the same as a younger child. Child safety and privacy groups have similarly stressed the importance of getting this right.Working together toward a strong, consistent standardThe work ahead is both complex and important. Reaching the right answers for children and teens will depend on collaboration and support among a diverse set of organizations. We hope that today\u2019s Framework contributes to global conversations about building consistent and strong standards, while accounting for unique views of different societies on how best to protect their young people.Working together, we\u2019re confident we can deliver on the promise of a safe and enriching digital world for our children.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nFamilies\n  \nSafety & Security\n  "}

The decision shows the weakness of a central plank of Sonos\u2019 campaign. The court stated that Sonos\u2019 patents are both invalid \u2014 meaning they never should have been granted in the first place \u2014 and unenforceable, and affirmed that we developed the technology first and independently.The court\u2019s decision to dismiss Sonos\u2019 claims wholesale speaks for itself:\u201cThis was not a case of an inventor leading the industry to something new,\u201d the Court wrote. \u201cThis was a case of the industry leading with something new and, only then, an inventor coming out of the woodwork to say that he had come up with the idea first \u2014 wringing fresh claims to read on a competitor\u2019s products from an ancient application.\u201d\u201cIn fact, in 2014, five years before Sonos filed the applications and presented the claims, accused infringer Google LLC shared with Sonos a plan for a product that would practice what would become the claimed invention\u2026 Google then began introducing its own products that practiced the invention in 2015. Even so, Sonos waited until 2019 to pursue claims on the invention (and until 2020 to roll out the invention in its own product line).\u201dThis decision is good news for our users who will once again be able to seamlessly group and integrate Google smart speakers, and for continued innovation of new features across the industry.However, it's an unfortunate reminder of how aggressive actors are increasingly abusing the patent system, wasting time and resources. \u201cIt is wrong that our patent system was used in this way,\u201d the Court wrote. \u201cWith its constitutional underpinnings, this system is intended to promote and protect innovation. Here, by contrast, it was used to punish an innovator and to enrich a pretender by delay and sleight of hand. It has taken a full trial to learn this sad fact, but, at long last, a measure of justice is done.\u201dAs we have long argued, the patent system is in need of reform to protect inventors while promoting innovation. For example, the United States Patent and Trademark Office needs more funding so that it can keep up with advancing technology, and dedicate the time that is needed to examine increasingly complex patents. The Patent Office should also require those applying for a patent to better explain their patent document and claims. Patent examination is a two-way street, and patent applicants need to do their part as well.With reforms like these, we can avoid costly litigation that slows down innovation, raises litigation costs, wastes the courts\u2019 time and resources, and, most importantly, harms consumers.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

This year marks the halfway point on the 15-year timeline to achieve these universally agreed objectives, which include ending poverty, ensuring quality education, promoting good health, and providing access to affordable and clean energy. The consensus? Sadly, not good. We\u2019re far behind where we need to be and, absent dramatic change, the world will fail to achieve the SDGs by 2030.Google has long believed that technology has an important role to play in catalyzing progress. In a variety of UNGA-related announcements and at events this year, we focused on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) \u2014 developed boldly and responsibly \u2014 can be the engine that helps spur progress on the SDGs.Here\u2019s a look at the work we launched to help solve some of the world\u2019s most pressing challenges:\nEnabling partners to use AI to achieve the SDGs\nGoogle.Org grantee Rainforest Connection\u2019s CEO Bourhan Yassin, speaks at the UN SDG Pavilion about how AI can detect threats, such as illegal logging, and monitor biodiversity to fight deforestation and climate change\nLast year at UNGA, we made a company-wide commitment to help accelerate progress on the SDGs, and to that end announced our $25 million AI for the Global Goals challenge. It's rooted in our belief that AI offers powerful tools for everyone to do good. Last week, we announced the 15 organizations from around the world who have been selected. They\u2019re using AI to benefit the world in wonderfully diverse ways\u2014from developing a machine learning toolkit to help rural midwives in low and middle income countries detect neonatal complications, to using open-source satellite imagery and machine learning to expand our knowledge of the world\u2019s wetlands, to deploying AI to develop climate-resilient rice varieties that will better equip farmers to mitigate climate risks.On Monday, we also announced at an event hosted by the U.S. Secretary of State Blinken, that Google.org will donate an additional $10 million to use AI to get help faster to victims of natural disasters and climate change \u2014 for example, utilizing Google\u2019s AI-enabled flood forecasting models to provide cash in advance of catastrophic flooding.\nKent Walker speaks at a U.S. State Department event on AI x SDGs hosted by Secretary of State Blinken\nThis brings our total contribution to more than $200 million in support of AI for Good, expanding the impact of NGOs and helping build an ethical, safe and robust AI ecosystem.We\u2019ll continue to help drive public awareness of the SDGs and why they are important, including our donation of more than $40 million in Google Search ads to the UN since 2022.\nUsing data and AI to track progress\nThe world needs a consistent, reliable and comparable dataset to track progress on each of the SDGs and the 169 targets set by the UN. That\u2019s why Google\u2019s Data Commons and Google.org set out to organize the world\u2019s publicly available data to make it more accessible and useful through a partnership with the UN Statistics Division.This week at UNGA, we announced the UN Data Commons for the SDGs, a tool that tracks metrics across the 17 SDGs and integrates authoritative SDG data and insights from across the UN system into a publicly available tool with AI-powered search functionality. This new tool will allow policymakers, NGOs and the public to easily access relevant insights and visualizations, gain valuable perspectives on SDG progress, and ultimately facilitate data-driven strategies and decisions. It also makes it easy to explore and download SDG data by region, country and goal.\nGoogle\u2019s SVP for Research, Technology & Society, James Manyika, speaks at a Google-hosted UNGA reception.\nRuth\u00a0Porat, President & Chief Investment Officer; Chief Financial Officer, Alphabet and Google, at the Clinton Global Initiative.\nGoogle Fellow, R.V. Guha, demonstrating the AI-driven tool to UN Tech Envoy Amandeep Gill at a Google-hosted UNGA reception\nYouTube CEO Neal Mohan speaks with Canadian creator Lilly Singh and Brazilian creator Nathalie Arcuri at the SDG Pavilion, about the power of YouTube to reach audiences on critical issues facing the world, including the Sustainable Development Goals.\nContinuing to lead the way\nAll of this work builds on Google\u2019s own commitment to ensure we\u2019re developing AI boldly and responsibly. Google set the standard for ethical deployment of AI when, in 2018, we were the first major company to publish a set of AI Principles to govern our own development of AI.We continue to live by this set of principles in all that we do. And we\u2019re doing it in consultation with a range of groups, including bringing together human rights organizations this week to discuss opportunities and risks of AI.We\u2019re pleased that others are joining us. This summer, working with the U.S. White House and other leading AI companies, we committed to advancing responsible practices in developing and using AI, which we hope will be the blueprint for a similar set of international principles. We\u2019ve shared our progress on this work, and just last week launched the $20 million Digital Futures Project, an initiative that aims to bring together a range of voices to promote efforts to understand and address the opportunities and challenges of AI.\nThe sprint to 2030\nWhen launched in 2015, the SDGs were seen as distant and aspirational. The past eight years has done little to change that. But AI could be the game-changing development the world needs to make generational progress, improving lives and the planet. Our approach to AI must be both bold and responsible \u2014 to maximize the positive benefits to society while addressing the challenges.As we pass the halfway mark of the UN SDGs, we look forward to working with international organizations, governments, civil society, academia and fellow industry to ensure AI is developed, deployed and used to maximize our collective human potential.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Our engineers work to offer the best search engine possible, making thousands of improvements every year so that we deliver the most helpful results, for free.Next week we go to trial to defend ourselves against a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general focused on how we distribute Google Search. As we\u2019ve said from the beginning, this lawsuit is deeply flawed, and we\u2019re pleased that the Court has significantly narrowed it, dismissing claims regarding the design of Google Search.We plan to demonstrate at trial that our Search distribution agreements reflect choices by browsers and device makers based on the quality of our services and the preferences of consumers. Making it easier for people to get the products they want benefits consumers and is supported by American antitrust law. In sum, people don't use Google because they have to \u2014 they use it because they want to.Here\u2019s more detail about the choices at the heart of this case:\nThere are more ways than ever to search for informationOur promotion and distribution of Google Search hasn\u2019t harmed competition or reduced consumer choice. To the contrary, there are more ways than ever to find information today. Just think about how you use the internet \u2014 you may look for recommendations on TikTok, Reddit or Instagram, find music and podcasts on Spotify, ask ChatGPT a question, or shop on Amazon. In fact, it\u2019s reported that over 60% of Americans start product searches on Amazon.\nBrowser and device makers have a choice, and they choose GoogleLet\u2019s start with browsers. Browser makers like Apple and Mozilla choose to feature a default search engine. They open competition for the default and pick the best search provider for their users. We compete hard for that placement, so that users can easily access Google Search.We\u2019re proud that browser makers opt to show Google Search based on the quality of our products. Apple\u2019s leaders have said they choose Google because it\u2019s \u201cthe best.\u201d Importantly, our browser agreements are not exclusive. As shown below, Bing and Yahoo! also pay Apple to be featured in Safari, and other rival services appear, too. In short, our success comes down to the quality of our products, not the quantity of our contracts.\nBing and Yahoo! pay Apple to be featured in Safari\niPhone 14 & MacBook Pro; iOS 16 & macOS 13 Ventura\nMozilla similarly chooses to show Google as the default search engine in their Firefox browser, and similarly offers promotional opportunities for other search providers like Bing and Yahoo!When it comes to Android, we offer phone makers the option to preload popular Google services on the device\u2019s home screen for free. We also pay device makers and carriers for additional promotion of services like Chrome and Search, similar to the way a supermarket might charge a cereal brand to promote its products at eye-level on a shelf or at the end of an aisle.Our promotional agreements on Android are entirely optional. Device makers and carriers can take open-source Android for free and build a phone without ever entering an agreement with Google. And when they do agree to include Google services, it helps their phones compete with Apple\u2019s iPhone and defray their costs, letting them offer a wide range of Android devices, some costing less than $100. Our distribution agreements on Android haven\u2019t harmed competition; they\u2019ve promoted it.\nIt\u2019s easy to change the default on browsers and on AndroidIf you prefer an alternative search service, changing the default is easy. As the graphics below illustrate, on the Safari desktop, you can switch the default in two clicks. On an iPhone, it takes four taps. And it takes just two taps to delete the Search widget on Android. That\u2019s all a far cry from the early days of uploading software via CD-ROMs you\u2019d have to buy from the store or doing time-consuming downloads over dial-up connections.\nIt takes two clicks to change the search engine on Safari desktop\n            Video format not supported\n          \nMacBook Pro - macOS 13 Ventura\nIt takes four taps to change the search engine on Safari mobile\n            Video format not supported\n          \niPhone 14 - iOS 16\nIt takes two taps to remove the Google search widget on Android\n            Video format not supported\n          \nSamsung Galaxy S23 - Android 13\nNotably, in 2014 when Mozilla chose to make Yahoo! the default search engine, many people actually switched back to Google. In other words, while default settings matter (that\u2019s why we bid for them), they\u2019re easy to change. People can and do switch.By contrast, Microsoft preloads its Edge browser on Windows, makes Bing the default search engine, and aggressively makes it much more difficult to switch. Despite this, the overwhelming majority of Microsoft users choose to search with Google. In fact, \u201cGoogle\u201d is the number one search query on Bing worldwide. Contrary to the DOJ\u2019s theory, people know they have choices, and they make them.The same is true for smartphones. It\u2019s easy to download apps \u2014 you probably do it all the time. Some of the most popular apps like Spotify, Instagram, TikTok, Uber and Amazon aren\u2019t preloaded on mobile devices. (And some that are preloaded don't do so well.)The bottom line is that success doesn\u2019t come from preloading \u2014 it comes from innovation and offering helpful products that people want to use.\nSearch Ads 360 facilitates ad campaigns on Bing, Yahoo! and othersFinally, even though we\u2019ve built a tool that makes it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns on multiple platforms \u2014 some state attorneys general claim that we should have built SA360 to include more features for Microsoft ads as fast as Microsoft wanted, instead of prioritizing the demands from our customers. American law doesn\u2019t require putting the preferences of your competitors over those of your clients. And Microsoft, which has plenty of resources, has chosen not to build its own search engine management tool.\nA backward-looking case at a time of unprecedented innovationThis lawsuit simply ignores how intensely competitive and dynamic the technology industry is today. Just look at the rapid AI advances across the industry (including Microsoft\u2019s investment in AI in search, Amazon and Apple\u2019s growing success in digital ads, or the ever-growing number of apps people use to find information like ChatGPT, TikTok and Wikipedia). Meanwhile, we\u2019re not standing still: We invest billions of dollars in R&D and make thousands of quality improvements to Search every year to ensure we\u2019re delivering the most helpful results. This competition benefits consumers by giving them better, more innovative services.We respectfully disagree with those who want to change antitrust law to promote the welfare of competitors rather than consumers. We put people first, and focus on getting them the services they need to find high-quality information easily and quickly. We look forward to making our case in court.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

The Frontier Model Forum will draw on the technical and operational expertise of its member companies to benefit the entire AI ecosystem, such as through advancing technical evaluations and benchmarks, and developing a public library of solutions to support industry best practices and standards.The core objectives for the Forum are:Advancing AI safety research to promote responsible development of frontier models, minimize risks, and enable independent, standardized evaluations of capabilities and safety.Identifying best practices for the responsible development and deployment of frontier models, helping the public understand the nature, capabilities, limitations, and impact of the technology.Collaborating with policymakers, academics, civil society and companies to share knowledge about trust and safety risks.Supporting efforts to develop applications that can help meet society\u2019s greatest challenges, such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, early cancer detection and prevention, and combating cyber threats.Membership criteriaThe Forum defines frontier models as large-scale machine-learning models that exceed the capabilities currently present in the most advanced existing models, and can perform a wide variety of tasks.Membership is open to organizations that:Develop and deploy frontier models (as defined by the Forum).Demonstrate strong commitment to frontier model safety, including through technical and institutional approaches.Are willing to contribute to advancing the Forum\u2019s efforts including by participating in joint initiatives and supporting the development and functioning of the initiative.The Forum welcomes organizations that meet these criteria to join this effort and collaborate on ensuring the safe and responsible development of frontier AI models.What the Frontier Model Forum will doGovernments and industry agree that, while AI offers tremendous promise to benefit the world, appropriate guardrails are required to mitigate risks. Important contributions to these efforts have already been made by the US and UK governments, the European Union, the OECD, the G7 (via the Hiroshima AI process), and others.To build on these efforts, further work is needed on safety standards and evaluations to ensure frontier AI models are developed and deployed responsibly. The Forum will be one vehicle for cross-organizational discussions and actions on AI safety and responsibility.The Forum will focus on three key areas over the coming year to support the safe and responsible development of frontier AI models:Identifying best practices: Promote knowledge sharing and best practices among industry, governments, civil society, and academia, with a focus on safety standards and safety practices to mitigate a wide range of potential risks.Advancing AI safety research: Support the AI safety ecosystem by identifying the most important open research questions on AI safety. The Forum will coordinate research to progress these efforts in areas such as adversarial robustness, mechanistic interpretability, scalable oversight, independent research access, emergent behaviors and anomaly detection. There will be a strong focus initially on developing and sharing a public library of technical evaluations and benchmarks for frontier AI models.Facilitating information sharing among companies and governments: Establish trusted, secure mechanisms for sharing information among companies, governments and relevant stakeholders regarding AI safety and risks. The Forum will follow best practices in responsible disclosure from areas such as cybersecurity.Kent Walker, President, Global Affairs, Google & Alphabet said: \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work together with other leading companies, sharing technical expertise to promote responsible AI innovation. We're all going to need to work together to make sure AI benefits everyone.\u201dBrad Smith, Vice Chair & President, Microsoft said: \u201cCompanies creating AI technology have a responsibility to ensure that it is safe, secure, and remains under human control. This initiative is a vital step to bring the tech sector together in advancing AI responsibly and tackling the challenges so that it benefits all of humanity.\u201dAnna Makanju, Vice President of Global Affairs, OpenAI said: \u201cAdvanced AI technologies have the potential to profoundly benefit society, and the ability to achieve this potential requires oversight and governance. It is vital that AI companies\u2013especially those working on the most powerful models\u2013align on common ground and advance thoughtful and adaptable safety practices to ensure powerful AI tools have the broadest benefit possible. This is urgent work and this forum is well-positioned to act quickly to advance the state of AI safety.\u201dDario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic said: \u201cAnthropic believes that AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We are excited to collaborate with industry, civil society, government, and academia to promote safe and responsible development of the technology. The Frontier Model Forum will play a vital role in coordinating best practices and sharing research on frontier AI safety.\u201dHow the Frontier Model Forum will workOver the coming months, the Frontier Model Forum will establish an Advisory Board to help guide its strategy and priorities, representing a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives.The founding companies will also establish key institutional arrangements including a charter, governance and funding with a working group and executive board to lead these efforts. We plan to consult with civil society and governments in the coming weeks on the design of the Forum and on meaningful ways to collaborate.The Frontier Model Forum welcomes the opportunity to help support and feed into existing government and multilateral initiatives such as the G7 Hiroshima process, the OECD\u2019s work on AI risks, standards, and social impact, and the US-EU Trade and Technology Council.The Forum will also seek to build on the valuable work of existing industry, civil society and research efforts across each of its workstreams. Initiatives such as the Partnership on AI and MLCommons continue to make important contributions across the AI community, and the Forum will explore ways to collaborate with and support these and other valuable multi-stakeholder efforts.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAI\n  "}

Today is a milestone in bringing the industry together to ensure that AI helps everyone. These commitments will support efforts by the G7, the OECD, and national governments to maximize AI\u2019s benefits and minimize its risks.We\u2019ve long believed that being bold on AI means being responsible from the start. Here\u2019s more on how we\u2019re doing just that:Applying AI to solve society\u2019s biggest challengesWe\u2019ve been working on AI for more than a dozen years, and in 2017 reoriented to be an \u201cAI-first company.\u201d Today AI powers Google Search, Translate, Maps, and other services you use every day. And we\u2019re using AI to solve societal issues \u2014 forecasting floods, cutting carbon emissions by reducing stop-and-go traffic, improving health care by answering clinical questions with more than 90% accuracy, and helping to treat and screen for diseases like breast cancer.Promoting safe and secure AI systemsBut it\u2019s not enough for AI to make better services \u2014 we also want to use it to make those services safe and secure. We design our products to be secure-by-default \u2014 and our approach to AI is no different. We recently introduced our Secure AI Framework (SAIF) to help organizations secure AI systems, and we expanded our bug hunters programs (including our Vulnerability Rewards Program) to incentivize research around AI safety and security. We put our models through adversarial testing to mitigate risks, and our teams are advancing the state of the art on topics like helping AI communicate in safer ways, preventing advanced models from being misused, and designing systems to be more ethical and fair.We\u2019re committed to continuing this work, and participating in additional red teaming exercises including one at DefCon next month.Building trust in AI systemsWe recognize that sometimes the power of new AI tools may amplify current societal challenges like misinformation and unfair bias. That\u2019s why in 2018 we published a set of AI Principles to guide our work, and established a governance team to put them into action by conducting ethical reviews of new systems, avoiding bias and incorporating privacy, security and safety. And our Responsible AI Toolkit helps developers pursue AI responsibly as well. We will keep working to build trust in AI systems, including by sharing regular progress reports on our work.When it comes to content, we\u2019re taking steps to promote trustworthy information. We\u2019ll soon be integrating watermarking, metadata, and other innovative techniques into our latest generative models, and bringing an About this image tool to Google Search to give you context about where an image first appeared online. Addressing AI-generated content will require industry-wide solutions, and we look forward to working with others, including the Partnership on AI\u2019s synthetic media working group.Building responsible AI, togetherNone of us can get AI right on our own. We\u2019re pleased to be joining other leading AI companies in endorsing these commitments, and we pledge to continue working together by sharing information and best practices. Groups like the Partnership on AI and ML Commons are already leading important initiatives and we look forward to additional efforts to promote the responsible development of new generative AI tools.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2023-06-29 17:00:00+00:00", "title": "Our approach to news regulation", "category": "News", "url": "https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-regulation/", "post_text": "You may have seen in the news that, as a result of Canada\u2019s Bill C-18, we will be removing links to Canadian news from our Search, News and Discover products in Canada, and will no longer be able to operate Google News Showcase in the country when the law goes into effect. We don\u2019t take this decision lightly but the bill creates an unprecedented requirement that platforms pay for simply showing links to news, something that everyone else does for free. This creates uncertainty for our products and exposes us to uncapped financial liability simply for facilitating access to news.We\u2019re disappointed it has come to this but we have been clear that unworkable legislation could lead to changes to the availability of news on Google\u2019s products in Canada.We wanted to share context on this decision and address questions about our approach to news.Our approach to regulationWe share the belief of many policymakers that a vibrant journalism industry is important and are committed to doing our part to support a sustainable, independent and diverse news ecosystem. We take a principled approach to assessing proposed laws, considering whether they respect the open web and the free expression it enables, whether they impact our ability to provide people who use our products relevant, authoritative, diverse sources of information, and whether they allow us to operate with the clarity any business requires. We\u2019ve detailed some of our balanced and constructive public policy ideas to support sustainable, quality journalism and aim to work with governments on approaches that best fit each market.Whether it's Bill C-18 in Canada or proposed laws in other jurisdictions, when efforts to support journalism conflict with the core principles of the open web and undermine our products, we have to adjust how we operate. This has played out in different ways around the world:EuropeSince 2019, the European Copyright Directive (EUCD) allows search engines to freely link to and use \u201cshort extracts\u201d of news publishers' content and creates new undefined rights for publishers when longer extracts are used. Our compliance program licenses content from European publishers for our Search and News products. So far, we\u2019ve reached commercial agreements covering over 1,500 publications of all sizes across 15 EU countries and are continuing to work on others. The Spanish government\u2019s transposition of the EUCD in 2022 also ended an earlier requirement of a 2014 law to pay for links to news content in that country, enabling us to relaunch Google News after an eight-year hiatus.AustraliaIn 2021, Australia\u2019s News Media Bargaining Code became law after a spirited debate and our constructive engagement with the government. While we have long held that the Australian Code is a problematic law that should not be replicated, it has never been applied to any platform.Only \u201cdesignated\u201d platforms are subject to the Code, and the government must take into account the full scope of a platform's contribution to Australian news before designation. This encourages platforms and publishers to negotiate direct commercial partnerships in whatever form works best for their businesses. In Australia, partnerships with publishers for Google News Showcase offered a commercial and productive approach to address the objectives of the law, while ensuring our news products continue to be available. The government recognized these partnerships and hasn\u2019t designated Google.We often hear proponents claim that the Australian model works because it hasn\u2019t \u201cbroken the internet,\u201d but its provisions are actually untested. Other proposals modeling the Code are often based on a misperception of what it does and how it\u2019s been implemented.Czech RepublicIn 2022, the Czech Republic\u2019s transposition of Article 15 of EUCD went far beyond the provisions of the European Directive, creating disproportionate financial and operational risks for us. We were left with no choice but to remove previews from news publisher content, though we were able to retain links and headlines, which were unaffected by the law. We also regrettably shut down News Showcase and terminated the content licenses and commercial partnerships we had reached with Czech publishers to provide content for that product. If the law changes, we hope to make our services fully available again.TaiwanEarlier this year in Taiwan, working with government and industry, we announced a new Digital Co-prosperity Fund to support the digital future of the news ecosystem. We heard from publishers and policymakers in Taiwan that digital transformation was a key objective to ensure sustainability and future growth of the news industry. Administered by the Digital Transformation Association and supported by the Ministry of Digital Affairs and key industry partners, the fund will help publishers of all sizes build a digital foundation, expand their reach and improve audience engagement, as well as grow the diversity and quality of digital journalistic content for Taiwanese news readers.Supporting the news industryThrough our programs, partnerships and products, we\u2019re one of the world\u2019s largest financial supporters of journalism. Our products link people to publishers' websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2014 for free \u2014 and we offer subscription tools and ad technology to help publishers monetize this traffic. Google News Showcase, our licensing program and product experience for news organizations, operates in 22 countries with more than 2,300 participating publications. And through the Google News Initiative, we\u2019ve partnered with more than 7,000 news publishers and counting around the world to provide training, tools and funding to journalists and newsrooms to help strengthen their work in the digital age.From local and regional news outlets to national and global perspectives, we provide people with access to diverse journalism to help them better understand the world. We\u2019re also continuing to create new products and tools to strengthen access to local news, provide access to a diverse range of sources, and address misinformation and help publishers expand and deepen connections with their audiences.We remain committed to working with publishers, governments and civil society to build a diverse, sustainable, and innovative future for news, both in Canada and around the world. We hope this helps people better understand our approach to news regulation.\nPOSTED IN:\nNews\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

It then attempted to sell information about consumers who had been lured in through such false claims. While we detected and removed this deceptive content, we\u2019re taking proactive legal action to stop this bad actor from scamming other platforms and to protect our users.Customers trust Google to provide authoritative and reliable results. But that trust is lost if they spend money based on fake reviews. This has real-world implications: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) cited a survey where consumers reported wasting $125 on average each year to inaccurate reviews.We work to stay ahead of scammers and protect small businesses by closely monitoring 24/7 for fraudulent content on our products, using a combination of people and technology. In 2022, we protected more than 185,000 businesses from further abuse after detecting suspicious activity and abuse attempts. We also stopped 20 million attempts to create fake Business Profiles in 2022, and continue to invest in new technologies and processes to keep information on our products helpful and reliable.The FTC and other regulators have prioritized holding bad actors responsible for deceiving consumers with fake reviews and misleading endorsements.

It fails to recognize how advanced advertising technology helps merchants reach customers and grow their businesses \u2014 while lowering costs and expanding choices for consumers.We look forward to showing how we have enabled higher-quality, more effective digital ads that have helped fund broader access to content and information online for everyone.Ad tech is fiercely competitive and constantly evolving. We compete with hundreds of companies in this space, including household names like Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta as well as specialized advertising technology companies like Criteo, The Trade Desk, and many others. Even media companies and retailers now offer competing advertising technologies.Many of these companies provide integrated ad tech services to both advertisers and publishers in the same way we do, because these integrated models help more efficiently connect advertisers, publishers, and consumers \u2014 benefiting all three.And competition for digital ad placement plays out every day, at every level. Customers regularly mix and match our tools with our competitors'. According to industry studies, the average large publisher will use six different platforms to sell ads on its website this year.1In such a crowded space, publishers, and advertisers choose to use Google because our products are effective and reliable. Our systems optimize for the most efficient results for our customers. Sometimes that places ads on our network, sometimes it doesn't. Our ad tech fees are transparent and consistent with industry rates. And our industry-leading tools help publishers and advertisers verify that they don\u2019t face hidden fees in buying and selling ad placements.The digital advertising market enjoys competitive pricing, lively innovation, and robust competition \u2014 helping advertisers, publishers, and consumers.

To estimate where you are, we rely on several sources, like GPS and Wi-Fi, so accuracy can be impacted by a variety of factors, like whether you\u2019re inside a building, in a dense area or underground.This deletion applies to certain medical facilities, including counseling centers, domestic violence shelters, abortion clinics, fertility centers, addiction treatment facilities, weight loss clinics, cosmetic surgery clinics, and others. If you visit a general purpose medical facility (like a hospital), the visit may persist.We continue to look for ways to improve the user experience and make it more intuitive. For instance, currently, you can manually add or confirm a visit to a particularly personal place, which may cause the entry to persist.

In addition, we have protections around:Location History: Location History is a Google account setting that is off by default, and for those that turn it on, we provide simple controls like auto-delete so users can easily delete parts, or all, of their data at any time. Some of the places people visit \u2014 including medical facilities like counseling centers, domestic violence shelters, abortion clinics, fertility centers, addiction treatment facilities, weight loss clinics, cosmetic surgery clinics, and others \u2014 can be particularly personal. Today, we\u2019re announcing that if our systems identify that someone has visited one of these places, we will delete these entries from Location History soon after they visit. This change will take effect in the coming weeks.User Data on Apps: Google Play has strict protocols to protect user privacy \u2014 including policies that prohibit developers from selling personal and sensitive user data and a requirement that they handle that data securely and only for purposes directly related to operating the app. To further promote transparency and control for users, we also recently introduced Play\u2019s new data safety section that developers use to give people more information about how apps collect, share, and secure their data. For Google Fit and Fitbit, we give users settings and tools to easily access and control their personal data, including the option to change and delete personal information, at any time. For example, Fitbit users who have chosen to track their menstrual cycles in the app can currently delete menstruation logs one at a time, and we will be rolling out updates that let users delete multiple logs at once.Law Enforcement Demands for User Data: Google has a long track record of pushing back on overly broad demands from law enforcement, including objecting to some demands entirely. We take into account the privacy and security expectations of people using our products, and we notify people when we comply with government demands, unless we\u2019re prohibited from doing so or lives are at stake \u2014 such as in an emergency situation. In fact, we were the first major company to regularly share the number and types of government demands we receive in a Transparency Report. We remain committed to protecting our users against improper government demands for data, and we will continue to oppose demands that are overly broad or otherwise legally objectionable. We also will continue to support bipartisan legislation, such as the NDO Fairness Act recently passed by the House of Representatives, to reduce secrecy and increase transparency around government data demands.We\u2019re committed to delivering robust privacy protections for people who use our products, and we will continue to look for new ways to strengthen and improve these protections. We support Congressional efforts to reach bipartisan agreement on nationwide privacy protections that move the burden of privacy off individuals and establish good data practices across the board. In the meantime, we will continue our focus on securing our products and protecting the privacy of our users around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Technology has been an incredible enabler of democracy worldwide. Google products like Search, YouTube and Android help billions of people around the world access information, connect, and express themselves. Whether it\u2019s helping people find important election information, giving citizens and journalists platforms to hold power to account, helping small businesses reach far-away markets or enabling everyone to safely access the open internet, our technologies are supporting key democratic principles of free expression, human rights, accountable governance and economic opportunity.At the same time, democracy is under pressure. Authoritarian governments and malicious actors are increasingly abusing technology to censor speech, launch cyberattacks and surveil citizens. Democracies, too, are increasingly going their own way and adopting regulations that risk fragmenting the internet and making it less secure, less open and less safe.Defending and sustaining democracy requires collective action from governments, civil society and businesses. We were pleased to see more than 60 countries come together at the inaugural Democracy Summit to sign the Declaration for the Future of the Internet and commit to protecting a free, open and secure global internet. All signatories must double-down on this pledge and stem the growing tide of protectionism and fragmentation that risks weakening core democratic ideals.To build on our ongoing work, we are announcing new commitments to help support more resilient democracies:Protecting human rights: Google.org is launching a $2 million fund to support human rights defenders who play a critical role in promoting democracy. This new fund will support digital security and safety helplines, which provide help to human rights defenders and those vulnerable to doxxing, harassment, account hacking and more.Providing access to authoritative information: To help people globally to evaluate information and understand where it\u2019s coming from, we\u2019re launching a new information literacy feature in Search called \u201cAbout this Author.\u201d It will be available in English globally and will provide people with more information about the author or creator of an article or blog. We are also enhancing our suite of information literacy tools by making our About this result feature available in all languages where Search operates globally. In addition, Jigsaw is launching new prebunking campaigns on several platforms in Europe and APAC to help strengthen users\u2019 resilience to disinformation.Protecting digital security: We recently announced we\u2019re providing 100,000 Titan Security Keys at no cost to individuals who are at higher risk of cyber attacks such as journalists, human rights defenders and others. We will also continue to provide strong security to those who need it most with our Advanced Protection Program (APP), Project Shield, and through our Online Safety and Security Partnerships with Defending Digital Campaigns and the International Foundation of Electoral Systems.Preventing misuse of technology: The rise of commercial vendors selling sophisticated tools to authoritarian governments presents a significant threat to high risk users and the broader online ecosystem. Google has played a leading role disrupting these threats and raising public awareness. Yesterday, we joined other private sector companies in endorsing new industry principles aimed at combating commercial hacking, stopping the spread of digital surveillance and helping victims of cyberattacks. Jigsaw has also committed to convening ecosystem stakeholders in the next 6 months to discuss the role that technology and policy can play in thwarting digital authoritarianism.Technology has an important role to play in supporting democracy. We\u2019re particularly excited about the power of emerging technologies like AI to tackle big societal challenges, and we\u2019ve long worked to build AI responsibly, in line with our AI principles and key parts of the OSTP AI Bill of Rights. But to get it right, all of us \u2013 governments, civil society, businesses and citizens \u2013 must work together to protect a free, open and secure internet while resisting efforts to fragment it.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Since then we\u2019ve launched new products to help address specific needs, new protections against cyber attacks and new efforts to provide high-quality, reliable information and to fight disinformation. We\u2019ve also provided assistance to Ukrainians who have been affected, including essential support for our Google colleagues and their families in the region.We shared our first commitments in March 2022 and provided another update in December 2022. As we continue to support Ukraine, we\u2019ll share our latest updates here.February 2023The war has highlighted the critical role cybersecurity plays in warfare. In \u201cFog of War,\u201d a report published by Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) with additional insights from Mandiant and Trust & Safety teams, we shared that Russian government-backed attacks targeting users in Ukraine increased 250% last year, while those targeting users in NATO countries increased by 300%. Meanwhile, more destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine were observed during the first four months of 2022 than in the previous eight years. Additionally, the report details Google\u2019s work to interfere with these activities, including disrupting more than 1,950 instances of Russian information operations activity on our platforms last year. Read more about our efforts, insights and what we expect in the future.At the Munich Security Conference (MSC), we reflected on a year of cyber and information operations in Ukraine and beyond and shared our perspective on how transformational innovations enabled by AI could further efforts to promote digital security. Read more from Kent Walker, our President of Global Affairs, in this blog post about the critical need for a proactive digital agenda with governments, civil society and the private sector.The threat posed by coordinated disinformation operations remains persistent, and we have sought to confront it head-on. We\u2019ve invested in a number of efforts to tackle the spread of and harms caused by mis- and disinformation. For example, we piloted Jigsaw\u2019s \u201cprebunking\u201d campaign in Poland, Czechia and Slovakia, to preemptively fight against narratives scapegoating Ukrainian refugees. The initiative proved so effective that we announced at the MSC that we will expand it this year to Germany, in partnership with Moonshot and local experts. In addition, experts from the Google Safety Engineering Center in Dublin \u2014 Google's regional hub of content responsibility specialists and engineers \u2014 conducted a series of Fighting Misinformation Online roundtables with local governments, NGOs and fact-checking organizations across Central and Eastern Europe. In several roundtable sessions and summits in the region, we shared Google and YouTube\u2019s approach to mis- and disinformation, and learned real-time insights from over 100 local experts and organizations.At the same time, over the past year, YouTube teams have removed more than 9,000 channels and 85,000 videos related to the war for violating our Community Guidelines. Additionally, early in the war, we blocked YouTube channels associated with Russian state-funded news channels globally, resulting in more than 800 channels and 4 million videos blocked. Our breaking news and top news shelves on the YouTube homepage have received more than 170 million views in Ukraine, helping people stay connected and informed. And as the largest video-sharing platform in Russia, people continue to rely on YouTube for uncensored news and information.The war has significantly impacted the Ukrainian economy; we are working to help support Ukrainians maintain their livelihoods. The Google for Startups Ukraine Support Fund helps entrepreneurs across Ukraine working in extraordinary circumstances to ensure that their businesses maintain liquidity, continue operations and incentivize further investment. Since launching the fund, many of the startups we supported have been able to expand to new markets, have raised follow-on funding, and have been recognized as creating the world's top inventions, like Esper Bionics. More than 60 representatives from Ukrainian startups continue to work from the Google for Startups Campus in Warsaw, Poland, and we\u2019re looking forward to gathering with many founders at our Google for Startups Ukraine Support Fund Summit in Warsaw on March 30, helping them to build critical connections with international investors.The war has displaced millions, and we are doing our part to help. At our office in Warsaw, one of the nonprofits we\u2019re supporting \u2014 Our Choice Foundation, which operates Ukrainian House \u2014 continues to work from one floor in our building. About 60 representatives from the organization use the space as a regular office where the team organizes all kinds of assistance for Ukrainian refugees arriving in Poland, including finding a place to stay, helping enroll kids in school, searching for a job, and registering for language courses.Google.org and Googlers have provided $45 million in funding for humanitarian aid as well as longer-term refugee support and recovery efforts. As part of this, we recently donated $1 million to Vostok, an organization in Ukraine that is helping respond to urgent needs including supplying food and hygiene products and assisting with the evacuation of immobile people. In addition, we\u2019ve provided $7 million in donated Search advertising for humanitarian relief updates and to counter misinformation. We\u2019ve also provided Google.org Fellowships to four organizations, which are already delivering critical support in the region: International Rescue Committee, Tech to the Rescue, NeedsList and East Europe Foundation. For example, a team of Google.org Fellows worked with the International Rescue Committee to expand the Googler-co-founded United for Ukraine platform, which has already reached 5 million people, as well as helping nearly 300,000 refugees access information to cross the border and matching 15,000 refugees with temporary accommodation.Finally, all of our 50,000 donated Chromebooks for schools have been delivered throughout Ukraine and an estimated 1.5 million students are using the devices for continuity of education (both online and offline). We\u2019ve also extended free access to our premium Google Workspace for Education features for 250 universities and colleges until the end of August 2023. And we\u2019re proud that 115,000 teachers have completed a series of trainings on Google Workspace, bringing us close to our 200,000 goal by May 2023.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2023-02-16 15:00:00+00:00", "title": "Google returns to the Munich Security Conference", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/google-returns-to-the-munich-security-conference/", "post_text": "It\u2019s been a year of dramatic changes in both geopolitics and technology.Fog of War, a new report published jointly this week by Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Mandiant (now part of Google Cloud), and Google Trust & Safety, outlines cyber attacks by Russian-backed actors designed to disrupt and destroy, to spy, and to lie.Russia targeted Ukraine and NATO countries on a massive scale. Mandiant observed more destructive cyber attacks in Ukraine during the first four months of 2022 than it had seen in the previous eight years. Compared to 2020, attacks targeting users in Ukraine increased by 250% and attacks targeting users in NATO countries increased by over 300%.Our report also details Russia\u2019s attempts to sow disinformation at home and abroad, trying to alter the information landscape through a range of operations seeking to shape public perceptions of the war.And, zooming out from the war in Ukraine, we continue to see ongoing financially motivated attacks by bad actors in Russia, North Korea, and beyond, targeting everything from healthcare to critical infrastructure. Our increasingly contentious and fragmented geopolitical environment makes it harder to align on technology progress, but it also makes alignment even more important, and makes partnership essential. So what\u2019s needed?For starters, we need to work together to secure our digital world. To understand the benefit of a collaborative approach, we can look to the example set by the digital savvy Ukrainian government, which worked with Google Cloud and others to shift to cloud-based security and infrastructure.\nBeyond the cyber war, tech platforms are also playing a part in helping countries build resilience in the face of an information war.To that end, Google\u2019s Jigsaw teamed up with leading academics, civil society organizations and disinformation experts to pilot a method of fighting disinformation known as \u201cprebunking\u201d in Poland, Czechia and Slovakia. Based on social science research, prebunking works by helping people build psychological resilience to disinformation before they encounter misleading claims.The initiative proved effective \u2013 so effective in fact, that this week we announced we are expanding it to Germany, in partnership with Moonshot and local experts. In addition, last year YouTube blocked more than 800 channels and over 4 million videos tied to Russian state-funded news media. And YouTube\u2019s Hit Pause media literacy campaign has reached more than a billion people with tips for how to identify manipulation tactics used to spread misinformation.As the invasion of Ukraine approaches the one-year mark, policymakers are taking a deeper look at the role technology has played in strengthening cyberdefense.And they are asking how transformational innovations may enhance security resilience in the future.Dramatic advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning mean that as we face new challenges, we will be able to draw on new cyber-defense tools, as well as innovations that will keep us at the front of the global competitiveness race.AI is transitioning from deep research and one-off breakthroughs into products and applications that allow people to work in completely new ways.In 2017, Google developed the Transformer architecture, the foundation for modern language models. But that\u2019s only the beginning.AI is opening the curtain on a new era in science and technology \u2014 a new era in nuclear fusion, quantum science, personalized medicine, agricultural productivity, materials science, and more.On the security and information front, AI will help us detect, analyze, and block anomalous behavior and combat phishing and malware efficiently, effectively, and at scale in real time. We\u2019re already seeing this today: AI applications predict whether emails pose a threat, and machine learning identifies toxic comments and problematic videos. For example, on YouTube, as we expanded our investments in people and machine learning, the rate of views on content that violates our Community Guidelines dropped by 75% from Q3 2017 to Q4 2020 \u2013 and continues to shrink.We\u2019ll soon have automated cyber defenses at an even broader scale, with advanced intelligence stopping attacks before they reach users. AI is just the latest frontier in the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between cyber-attackers and cyber-defenders.With AI computations doubling every six months, it\u2019s time for government, industry, academia, and the security community to align on common approaches and ensure these technologies are used responsibly.We need a proactive digital agenda that promotes the benefits of these technologies while addressing the need for:Secure-by-default products that provide resistance and resilience against sophisticated cyber attacks, helping society rise above today\u2019s endless cycle of hacks and patches.Education and training initiatives like the Google for Startups Growth Academy for Cybersecurity and our new grant to the Technical University of Munich (TUM) supporting privacy, cybersecurity, and safety research.Holistic approaches to governing and supporting new technologies. Not protectionism and localization, but a policy framework that scales advanced technologies in ways that share their benefits across democratic societies.We\u2019re at a watershed moment that calls for us to be bold, responsible and collaborative.Technology can help secure our digital future while unlocking incredible opportunities \u2014 but only if we work together in a spirit of digital solidarity, ensuring that technology works for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

It largely duplicates an unfounded lawsuit by the Texas Attorney General, much of which was recently dismissed by a federal court. DOJ is doubling down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow. We\u2019ve already responded in detail to many similar claims made in the complaint led by the Texas Attorney General.The lawsuit tries to rewrite history at the expense of publishers, advertisers and internet users.DOJ is demanding that we unwind two acquisitions that were reviewed by U.S. regulators 12 years ago (AdMeld) and 15 years ago (DoubleClick). In seeking to reverse these two acquisitions, DOJ is attempting to rewrite history at the expense of publishers, advertisers and internet users. Both of these acquisitions enabled us to invest heavily in developing new and innovative advertising technologies. These deals were reviewed by regulators, including by DOJ, and allowed to proceed. Since then, competition in this sector has only increased.Government shouldn\u2019t pick winners and losers in a competitive industry.We are one of hundreds of companies that enable the placement of ads across the Internet. And it\u2019s been well reported that competition is increasing as more and more companies enter and invest in building their advertising businesses.Last year, Microsoft acquired Xandr \u2013 an advertising platform that, like Google and many of its competitors, has a full ad tech stack that serves advertisers and publishers. This acquisition enabled Microsoft to sign a landmark deal to build Netflix\u2019s advertising business. The government did not challenge this acquisition.Amazon\u2019s advertising business is now growing faster than Google and Meta\u2019s advertising businesses.Apple has a fast-growing advertising business, which is expected to reach over $30 billion in the next four years. It\u2019s also been widely reported that Apple is building its own demand-side platform, expanding its advertising footprint.Only five years after launching outside of mainland China, TikTok is reported to have nearly $10 billion in advertising revenue and continues to grow rapidly.Media companies like Comcast and Disney, and retailers like Walmart and Target, continue to invest in building their own online advertising technology services.There are also specialized advertising technology companies like AppLovin, Criteo, Index Exchange, Pubmatic, Magnite, MediaMath, OpenX, The Trade Desk, Unity and many others. In fact, The Trade Desk was recently ranked one of the fastest growing companies. These may not be household names, but they power many of the ads you see every day.With this increased competition, it\u2019s no wonder fees across the industry are reportedly flat or falling for digital display advertising technology.Google\u2019s products expand choice for publishers and advertisers.This complaint mischaracterizes how our advertising technology products work.These products help publishers make money to fund their websites, apps and videos \u2013 which helps Internet users access a wide range of free content. And they make it easy for businesses to reach consumers through cost-effective digital advertising. Here are some facts:Our advertising technologies are built to work with our competitors' products. We make it easy for partners to choose the products and services they want to use across more than 80 rival platforms for publishers and over 700 rival platforms for advertisers.No one is forced to use our advertising technologies \u2013 they choose to use them because they\u2019re effective. In fact, publishers and advertisers typically work with multiple technologies simultaneously to reach customers and make more money.The average large publisher will use six different platforms to sell ads on its website this year, while advertisers and media agencies will use over three platforms to buy ads, on average.1Publishers who choose to use our advertising platforms keep the vast majority of the revenue our tools help facilitate. In total, we pay billions of dollars directly to the publishing partners in our ad network every year.DOJ\u2019s lawsuit would reverse years of innovation, harming the broader advertising sector.The current Administration has stressed the value of antitrust enforcement in reducing prices and expanding choice for the American people. We agree.But this lawsuit would have the opposite effect, making it harder for Google to offer efficient advertising tools that benefit publishers, advertisers and the wider U.S. economy. Antitrust cases shouldn\u2019t penalize companies that offer popular, efficient services, particularly in difficult economic times.And they shouldn\u2019t force companies to reverse 15-year-old investments that they have nurtured and worked hard to make successful, especially when those investments were already reviewed by regulators and allowed to proceed.We\u2019ve spent years building and investing in our advertising technology business to support a vibrant, open web. We will vigorously contest attempts to break tools that are working for publishers, advertisers, and people across America.You can read our responses to the DOJ's specific allegations here.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Google, and its decision could radically alter the way that Americans use the internet. The case centers on Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 \u201cthe twenty-six words that created the internet.\u201d Section 230 protects hosting, displaying, or sharing content from other people. In real-world terms, it means that Spotify can recommend new songs, Monster can show relevant job postings, Etsy can promote niche antiques from small sellers, and you can \u201clike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d material you see online.The question before the Court is whether Section 230 should continue to protect the organization, display, and recommendation of content from others. The stakes could not be higher. A decision undermining Section 230 would make websites either remove potentially controversial material or shut their eyes to objectionable content to avoid knowledge of it. You would be left with a forced choice between overly curated mainstream sites or fringe sites flooded with objectionable content.Here are some of the points we make in the brief we filed today:Section 230 protects content recommendations: Section 230 has always protected the ability of online services and their users to highlight relevant, useful content from others, connecting people to the material they enjoy. Legal risk for recommending or organizing content would reduce useful services like showing the best job listings, listing the most relevant products, or displaying the most helpful videos of recipes, songs, or sources of news, entertainment and information.Upending Section 230 would harm free expression: Section 230 supports free expression online, enabling websites to offer a wide-range of information and allow a diversity of voices to be discovered and heard. Without Section 230, some websites would be forced to overblock, filtering content that could create any potential legal risk, and might shut down some services altogether. That would leave consumers with less choice to engage on the internet and less opportunity to work, play, learn, shop, create, and participate in the exchange of ideas online.Upending Section 230 would make the internet less safe: At the same time, Section 230 empowers websites to remove or demote spam, scams and offensive content. Without Section 230, websites with fewer resources would be less likely to review and moderate egregious content for fear of litigation based on their knowledge of that content. Services could become less useful and less trustworthy \u2014 as efforts to root out scams, fraud, conspiracies, malware, violence, harassment, and more are stifled.Section 230 is the economic backbone of the internet: Undercutting Section 230 would lead to businesses and websites being unable to operate and to more lawsuits that would hurt publishers, creators, and small businesses. That rising tide of litigation would reduce the flow of high-quality information on the internet, which has created millions of American jobs, innovative new ideas, and trillions in economic growth.If the Supreme Court were to change the widely accepted application of Section 230, it would result in a digital experience \u2014 for everyone \u2014 that reflects the exact opposite of Congress's legislative intent. It would impede access to information, limit free expression, hurt the economy, and leave consumers more vulnerable to harmful online content.Don\u2019t take our word for it. A broad cross-section of experts, academics, organizations and businesses from across America also recognize the importance of Section 230. We appreciate their thoughtful perspectives and look forward to making our case on behalf of everyone who uses the internet.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

That\u2019s why our products, business operations, and decision-making around emerging technologies are all informed by our Human Rights Program and deep commitment to increase access to information and create new opportunities for people around the world.Today, we\u2019re sharing more information about our ongoing work and examples of how we\u2019re continuing to enhance and evolve our broader approach to human rights.\nStrengthening our programmatic approach\nWe\u2019ve long been committed to respecting the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its implementing treaties, and we continue to uphold the standards established in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and in the Global Network Initiative Principles. Through our Human Rights Program, we've developed a deeper understanding of both the opportunities and potential risks associated with technology by advising product teams on potential civil and human rights impacts, conducting human rights due diligence, and engaging external experts and stakeholders on these issues. Here are recent examples of how we\u2019ve been making progress on our commitment to human rights:Human Rights Due Diligence: Core to our work is establishing a strategic and cross-company methodology for assessing human rights impacts, addressing the findings, and tracking progress across our products and operations \u2014 with a particular focus on the most salient human rights risks. For example, our human rights due diligence informs our planning when we expand Google Cloud infrastructure into new countries or deploy certain technologies like Cloud AI solutions into various industries. More broadly, we assess human rights on a range of topics, such as misinformation and disinformation online. Our human rights due diligence enables us to address near-term events and establish the policies and processes required for a sustained and strategic approach to human rights risks.Independent Assessment: As a founding company member of the Global Network Initiative, Google is subject to a periodic assessment by an independent party to review how the company integrates GNI Principles into our governance, due diligence and risk management, and operational practices. This year we underwent our fourth assessment, and the GNI determined that we are making good-faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles with improvement over time.New Laws and Regulations: Whether it is regulation focused on the technology industry (such as the Digital Services Act or the EU's proposed AI Act) or industry-agnostic directives (such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence and Reporting Directives), human rights frameworks are playing an integral role in shaping new requirements of business. That's why our Human Rights Program is working closely with Google's implementation of these initiatives, to be sure that we are meeting these requirements in a manner that supports our human rights commitments.Crisis and Conflict Settings: According to the United Nations, approximately 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas. We\u2019ve engaged with organizations like the GNI and International Committee of the Red Cross to better understand the humanitarian and human rights risks of technology in crisis and conflict settings, and are working together to identify new ways to ensure technology is used responsibly to protect and assist people in need. In addition, we\u2019re supporting the development of tools and best practices that can benefit the broader ecosystem of technology companies and stakeholders globally, such as the Conflict-Sensitive Human Rights Due Diligence for ICT Companies, which was launched earlier this month by Business for Social Responsibility and JustPeace Labs.Multi-stakeholder Collaboration: Governments, the private sector, international organizations, and civil society each have a role to play in respecting and safeguarding human rights. That\u2019s why we remain invested in multi-stakeholder efforts like GNI and initiatives like UN BTech to inform and evolve our approach to human rights, and support the Freedom Online Coalition, Declaration for the Future of the Internet, and the Copenhagen Pledge to promote human rights frameworks and shared values globally.Through our Human Rights Program, we will continue to make good on our commitment to international norms and standards\u2014helping to ensure that responsible technology continues to benefit people around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Since the first days of the invasion, our priority has been helping the Ukrainian people, the government, and all those affected by the war. Nearly 10 months later, Ukrainians are still facing deadly attacks and the realities of life in an active war zone \u2014\u00a0and we remain focused on helping by providing cybersecurity and humanitarian assistance, blocking disinformation, and providing authoritative information to people in the region.Earlier today, Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykhailo Fedorov stopped by our offices in Washington, D.C. to discuss the challenges his country is facing and ways to extend Google\u2019s help in the months ahead. Here\u2019s an overview of some of the new commitments we\u2019re making today, as well as our continued efforts to support Ukraine:\nNew support for UkraineWe\u2019re continuing to provide critical cybersecurity and technical infrastructure support by making a new donation of 50,000 Google Workspace licenses for the Ukrainian government. By providing these licenses and giving a year of free access to our Workspace solutions, including our cloud-first, zero-trust security model, we can help ensure Ukrainian public institutions have the security and protection they need to deal with constant threats to their digital systems.Through Google.org and our employees, we have now committed $45 million in cash donations. In addition, we have provided $5 million in donated Search advertising and four Google.org Fellowships for humanitarian relief efforts. As part of this commitment, today we\u2019re announcing a $2 million grant and a Google.org Fellowship to the East Europe Foundation which will work with Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation to scale the national \"Diia\" Digital Education Portal. With Google\u2019s support, Diia hopes to provide 1 million people with personalized training and create 600,000 job placements.\nRelated Article\nRelated Article\nIn Warsaw: Announci\u2026\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai announces more support for Ukraine.\nSee more\nWe also remain committed to supporting the Ukrainian startup ecosystem and its vibrant IT and software sector.

We\u2019re helping them by monitoring the threat landscape in Eastern Europe and disrupting coordinated influence operations from Russian threat actors. To date, we\u2019ve removed more than 80,000 videos and 9,000 channels on YouTube related to the ongoing war in Ukraine for violating our Community Guidelines and Terms of Service. We\u2019ve also blocked YouTube channels associated with Russian state-funded news channels, globally: more than 750 channels and more than 4 million videos, including channels tied to RT and Sputnik.We also recognize that misinformation has specific regional dimensions. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve forged partnerships with think tanks and civil society organizations to conduct region-specific research into misinformation and disinformation, rolling out cash grants to support fact-checking networks and nonprofits. This includes a recent $2.5 million Google.org grant to Techsoup Europe to help civil society organizations across Central and Eastern Europe leverage technology to fight disinformation at scale.\nProviding cybersecurity assistanceThe Ukrainian government is under near-constant digital attack. That\u2019s why shortly after the invasion, we expanded eligibility for Project Shield, our free protection against DDoS attacks, so that Ukrainian government websites and embassies worldwide could stay online and continue to offer their crucial services. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to implement protections for users and track and disrupt cyber threats.Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has been tracking threat actors, both before and during the war, and sharing their findings publicly and with law enforcement. TAG\u2019s findings have shown that government-backed actors from Russia, Belarus, China, Iran, and North Korea have been targeting Ukrainian and Eastern European government and defense officials, military organizations, politicians, NGOs, and journalists, while financially motivated bad actors have also used the war as a lure for malicious campaigns.Mandiant, a part of Google Cloud, is also providing direct assistance to Ukrainian government entities under the Cyber Defense Assistance Collaborative \u2014 including compromise assessments, incident response services, shared cyber threat intelligence, and their Ukraine Crisis Resource Center \u2014 helping the Ukrainian government detect, mitigate, and defend against cyber attacks.\nSurfacing authoritative informationAccess to authoritative information is crucial for those on the ground and those seeking to flee danger in the region. In the early days of the invasion, we worked closely with the Ukrainian government to set up a system that sends rapid air raid alerts to Android mobile phones in at-risk areas, and to feature information on Search and Maps about shelter, humanitarian services, and aid points. Globally, we\u2019ve surfaced features on Search to provide quick access to authoritative information, including highlighting news coverage from trusted sources and other helpful context about the war. And on YouTube, we\u2019ve surfaced videos from authoritative sources in search results and recommendations. The breaking news and top news shelves on YouTube\u2019s homepage have received more than 100 million views in Ukraine.\nRelated Article\nRelated Article\nCritical informatio\u2026\nGoogle announces a $1.5m grant and Fellowship for the International Rescue Committee, alongside a further $10m commitment for aid in Ukraine.\nSee more\nPreserving Ukraine\u2019s cultural heritageRecently, we also announced \u201cUkraine is Here,\u201d a new collection on Google Arts & Culture that allows anyone to explore Ukraine\u2019s culture and traditions.

The court\u2019s ruling against the operators of this botnet sets an important legal precedent and sends a warning to cybercriminals and those who enable or protect them.\nLast December, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) shared the actions it took to disrupt the operations of the Glupteba botnet. Our legal team also filed a case in the Southern District of New York to hold the botnet operators accountable. We made the explicit decision to name the criminal actors behind Glupteba as defendants in the suit, to expose them and their various shell companies. This is not a common tactic, but we felt it was important to try and disrupt their ability to operate covertly online. We did this knowing it could lead to drawn-out litigation. The risk was that these actors \u2013 who are based in Russia \u2013 could attempt to abuse the U.S. court system by litigating from abroad with no intention of complying with the court\u2019s orders and could try to use the legal process to get information about Google\u2019s defense mechanisms. They attempted to do exactly that.\nBut the court saw through these attempts. On Tuesday, the court agreed with Google and granted our motion for sanctions, entering default judgment against the defendants to hold them responsible for attempting to mislead the court. In an extraordinary move, the court also issued monetary sanctions against both the Russian-based defendants and their US-based lawyer \u2013 requiring the criminal actors behind Glupteba to pay Google\u2019s legal fees. This step is particularly important because it shows that there will be real, monetary consequences for engaging in this type of criminal activity.\n\"It is now clear that the Defendants appeared in this Court not to proceed in good faith to defend against Google\u2019s claims but with the intent to abuse the court system and discovery rules to reap a profit from Google,\u201d said Federal Judge Denise Cote in her decision Tuesday.\nWe\u2019re pleased with the outcome of this case and believe it will have significant ramifications for online crime. While Glupteba operators have resumed activity on some non-Google platforms and IoT devices, shining a legal spotlight on the group makes it less appealing for other criminal operations to work with them. And the steps TAG took last year to disrupt their operations have already had significant impact. Over the past year, TAG has observed a 78% reduction in the number of infected hosts.\nBut there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. Legal cases that expose the criminal elements behind these types of operations are just one tool that Google uses to protect our services and the people and businesses who use them. We\u2019ll continue to put security at the core of everything we do through legal action, sophisticated threat intelligence from TAG, work with law enforcement, and partnerships with government cybersecurity agencies.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  "}

That\u2019s why we:\nLaunched auto-delete controls, a first in the industry, and turned them on by default for all new users, giving you the ability to automatically delete data on a rolling basis and only keep 3, 18 or 36 months worth of data at a time.Developed easy-to-understand settings like Incognito mode on Google Maps, preventing searches or places you navigate to from being saved to your account.Introduced more transparency tools, including Your Data in Maps and Search, which lets you quickly access your key location settings right from our core products.\nThese are just some ways that we have worked to provide more choice and transparency. Consistent with those improvements, we settled an investigation with 40 U.S. state attorneys general based on outdated product policies that we changed years ago. As well as a financial settlement, we will be making updates in the coming months to provide even greater controls and transparency over location data. The updates include:\nRevamping user information hubs: To help explain how location data improves our services, we\u2019re adding additional disclosures to our Activity controls and Data & Privacy pages. We\u2019re also creating a single, comprehensive information hub that highlights key location settings to help people make informed choices about their data.Simplified deletion of location data: We\u2019ll provide a new control that allows users to easily turn off their Location History and Web & App Activity settings and delete their past data in one simple flow. We\u2019ll also continue deleting Location History data for users who have not recently contributed new Location History data to their account.Updated account set-up: We\u2019ll give users setting up new accounts a more detailed explanation of what Web & App Activity is, what information it includes, and how it helps their Google experience.\nToday\u2019s settlement is another step along the path of giving more meaningful choices and minimizing data collection while providing more helpful services.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It\u2019s given us a world that is more innovative and more accessible. Yet the very openness that makes the digital world accessible to everyone, also leaves it uniquely vulnerable to security threats and cyber attacks.\nAt Google, we\u2019ve been working to solve this paradox for years \u2014 and have arrived at the conclusion that modern digital security actually can come through embracing openness. We protect more people online than anyone, and we recently announced a $10 billion investment in making the internet safer and more secure. But with the dramatic rise of state-sponsored cyber attacks and malicious actors online, it\u2019s clear that we not only need stronger public-private partnerships \u2014 but dynamic policy frameworks to shore up security for everyone.\nThat\u2019s why we welcome efforts by the U.S. Government to advance open source software security, such as the Securing Open Source Software Act introduced in the Senate last month. This bipartisan bill proposes the creation of a framework to guide the federal government in their use of open source software. The proposed legislation reflects a helpful focus on security and cyber risk mitigation to respond to a recent spike in malicious cyber activity against the software supply chain.\nWe are glad to see a continued emphasis on the importance of open source software security from the U.S. Government, and we hope that both public and private organizations will follow their lead to promote improved cybersecurity for the ecosystem at large.\nThe problem of securing open source\nThe world of open source software development allows collaboration and rapid innovation by sharing solutions freely. This community, built on openness and sharing, contributes an enormous amount of code to a majority of the applications we use today.\nHowever, despite the benefits of this openness, the unprecedented scale of recent attacks has emphasized gaps in infrastructure and tooling and the need for improved transparency into the security practices and attributes of open source projects. Seemingly simple questions about the open source supply chain are still difficult to answer:\nDoes a project contain known vulnerabilities?Are the project\u2019s maintainers and community following security best practices during software development?What open source dependencies are part of a particular piece of software?How secure was the distribution supply chain?\nAnswering these questions requires specialized technical skills and capabilities, and given the primarily volunteer-driven nature of the open source community, we cannot expect open source developers to shoulder the full burden of advancing software security on their own.\nContinued advances\nThrough our work with multiple industry collaborators, Google has helped create free tools, services and best practices to make it easier for the open source community to develop and distribute software securely, while providing consumers with information about the security of the software they use.\nWe envision a more secure future where the burden of security is shared, and there is increased trust in and resilience of the open source software ecosystem. To get there, we need freely available, automated solutions that make developer\u2019s lives easier, such as:\nInfrastructure that prevents tampering, by default, when software is being built and releasedAdvances in vulnerability discovery and management that automate finding, tracking and fixing bugs for developersSeamless connections across sources of security data and tools for analysis so consumers can have meaningful insight into the security of their software\nWe\u2019re currently working to make these solutions a reality, at scale, with little to no additional work for developers.\nSustaining the community\nWe hope that the framework that will emerge due to U.S. Government efforts drives further investments in open source communities by both the public and private sectors. We\u2019re already seeing the impact of the $100M Google pledged to non-profit organizations and software foundations like the Open Source Security Foundation to support open source creators.\nThis pledge backs efforts like our \u201copen source maintenance crew,\u201d a team of developers who spend 100 percent of their time directly enabling critical open source projects to adopt key security improvements. It also supports our Linux Kernel team, which continues to drive efforts to eliminate entire classes of bugs from open source code, including paving the way for greater memory safety using the Rust language.\nWe encourage other major consumers of open source to follow this lead and directly invest both funds and developer time in securing open source projects and ecosystems. Furthermore, we call on other major consumers of open source, both public and private, to implement similar policies around safe open source usage as well.\nSecuring open source software is a shared responsibility, and we look forward to continued collaboration on this urgent, critical problem.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

But we would suggest a different tack.Though it sounds like a paradox, the best modern digital security actually comes through embracing openness.\nThough it sounds like a paradox, the best modern digital security actually comes through embracing openness.\nKent Walker\nThat\u2019s because in today\u2019s mobile, hybrid environment, cybersecurity is a team sport. We are each only as strong as our weakest link. But when we work together, we spur innovation and advance best practices that benefit all.I speak from some experience here, as Google\u2019s services are attacked every day. And yet we keep more people safe than anyone else in the world. We do that by looking at security through a collective lens, leveraging open frameworks, and relying heavily on secure open-source software.We hope to use what we have learned to help secure Europe\u2019s \u201cdigital decade.\u201dTo that end, we recently published a white paper with recommendations like investing in technology that\u2019s secure by default; working with private and international partners on new areas of cooperation, and building security based on openness and interoperability.These recommendations are based on first-hand experience. In 2009, Google was the victim of a major cybersecurity attack, code named Operation Aurora. We learned that transparency, coupled with security by design, was the best way to secure the digital ecosystem.As we detail in our recently released docuseries, HACKING GOOGLE, Aurora changed everything. It spurred us to shift away from the old \u201cperimeter defense\u201d model of crunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle (with high outside walls but no interior defenses) to a zero-trust model in which all users, all devices, and all applications are continuously checked for security risks, and yet security comes easily and naturally for users.After Aurora, we launched our Threat Analysis Group, or TAG, to spot, disclose, and attribute threats, whether they were coming from nation-state actors or commercial spyware and surveillance vendors. We also launched our Project Zero team to find and promptly disclose previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities in our own and other companies\u2019 software, raising the security bar for everyone.It hasn\u2019t always been comfortable work\u2013but that kind of transparency is key to security. As the computer engineering saying goes, \u201cwith enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.\u201dToday, by adopting advanced security innovation and threat intelligence, we ensure vulnerabilities are fixed fast, before they can be widely exploited.You can see our approach in action whenever TAG discloses a new threat. For example, in 2017, our Android operating system was the first mobile platform to warn users about NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware\u2013\u201czero-click\u201d malware designed to allow an attacker to compromise a smartphone without a user taking any action.By sharing information early and widely, we raised awareness of this threat, helped victims understand if they were compromised, and promoted a greater focus on mitigations. Since then, TAG has continued to report on Pegasus and other commercial spyware tools, shining a light on this murky industry.So when the war came in Ukraine, open security principles kept us one step ahead. Since the war began, we\u2019ve sent thousands of warnings to users targeted by nation-state actors\u2013another practice we pioneered after Aurora. We\u2019ve succeeded in blocking the vast majority of the attacks. And we launched Project Shield, bringing not just journalists, but human rights organizations and even government websites in Ukraine under Google\u2019s security umbrella against distributed denial of service attacks.Because while it can be easy to DDOS small sites, it turns out that it\u2019s pretty tough to DDOS Google.We are all in on this collaborative approach to security. Currently, we are working with our team at VirusTotal to launch a new Google Safety Engineering Center in M\u00e1laga, Spain, which we hope will become a European hub for joint research on advanced threats.\nIn 2023, our newest Google Safety Engineering Center will be launching in M\u00e1laga.\nSince we acquired VirusTotal in 2012, they have grown from a scrappy startup to become the world\u2019s leading malware scanner and repository, what many call \u201cthe Google of cybersecurity tools.\u201d VirusTotal enables people to search for malware against the millions of new samples submitted daily.On top of that, when Google combined our existing security solutions with Mandiant\u2019s cyber threat intelligence, we laid the groundwork to help public and private sector organizations in Europe anticipate, warn about, and mitigate threats.What are the larger lessons for all of us as we work toward open security?First, partnerships and agreements among democratic and rule-of-law societies are key. We need to set aside siloed approaches and embrace an ecosystem of innovation where security experts can share threats, evolve best practices, and adopt new technologies.In support of that ecosystem, I\u2019m pleased to announce that in 2023, we will be hosting a new Google for Startups Growth Academy for EU Cybersecurity, a growth program to help cybersecurity startups across Europe grow into success stories.Second, interoperability and aligned security standards between technologies and among countries makes compliance easier for businesses, innovators, and manufacturers of all sizes\u2013which makes for more secure hardware and better software.The third and final thing to keep in mind is that when we shift away from buggy legacy technology and perimeter defense models and toward modern infrastructure, we can accommodate today\u2019s increasingly global, hybrid workforces, without sacrificing security.Collective security requires not just walls, but bridges.By adopting an approach built on open principles like security-by-default, zero-trust architecture, transparency, and principled partnerships, we can advance the frontiers of information security, letting all of us sleep better at night.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

Meanwhile, inflation, high energy prices and fiscal pressures are in focus for policymakers everywhere.\nAgainst this gloomy backdrop, one area that remains a source of optimism is the potential for digital transformation to jumpstart economic growth and create new opportunities \u2014 particularly for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) who often are most vulnerable to economic downturns. As more people and businesses come online, particularly in emerging markets, the internet continues to create new opportunities for businesses to export and grow.\nA report that we\u2019re launching today gives us a sense of the scale of the opportunity, estimating that the right investments in digital transformation can boost the exports of six Latin American countries up to $140 billion annually, by 2030 \u2013 a four-fold increase over current levels.\n\u201cThe Digital Sprinters\u201d\nToday\u2019s report builds on our 2020 Digital Sprinters framework, which offered a blueprint for how emerging economies can accelerate their digital transformation with investments in four key areas:\nInfrastructure: Investing in digital connectivity and secure and environmentally sustainable infrastructure, including smart management.People: Preparing people across all communities for the jobs of the future by helping to skill and train them for the digital economy.Technological innovation: Deploying technological innovation that can unlock new opportunities. Increasing the use of data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, to create efficiencies and enable economic growth.Public policies: Creating a predictable regulatory ecosystem that promotes competitiveness, open markets, interoperable regulatory standards, and tax regimes based on international standards.\nDigital Exports in Latin America\nTo assess the potential for Latin America, we commissioned new research to better understand digital exports and their potential to impact six economies in the region. The results are noteworthy. Overall, researchers projected digital exports to contribute more than 2% of GDP for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay by 2030, or approximately $140 billion per year \u2013 an increase from the current $34 billion, or 0.8% of GDP.\nThe research identifies three ways in which the digitization is changing trade in Latin America:\nEasier access to new markets. The lion\u2019s share of current and potential economic gains come from digital tools that facilitate access to overseas markets, making it easier to sell abroad. What previously required heavy upfront investment and navigating complex bureaucratic processes can today be handled online, often on a smartphone or tablet. Over 60% of economic growth is fuelled by tools like online ads, which are regularly served to consumers abroad. Cloud services are another driver of digital exports, enabled by new infrastructure investments in the region, like Google\u2019s \u201cCloud Regions\u201d in Santiago, Chile, and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.New products. The second area, making up over a third of expected gains, are exports of a growing array of new digital products and services. Think of mobile apps that find a global audience through the Play Store or other platforms. More than 2.5 billion people in over 190 countries use Google Play every month. And more than 2 million developers work with us to build their businesses and reach people around the globe. Video streaming is another example where content produced in one country can easily be exported. Paying out over $6 billion to content creators between 2021 and 2022, YouTube is enabling content and culture to transcend borders.Digitization of trade procedures. A third area that is contributing to export growth is the overall digitalization of trade processes. Think paperless procedures at the border or in ports, email or online forms instead of phone calls, or Cloud computing or artificial intelligence technologies to simplify formerly complex trade machinery while shrinking the cost. Google Translate supports more than 100 languages, it can translate entire websites, scanned documents or pictures, enabling seamless communication across borders. While not counted in overall estimates, digitalization of trade would bring additional efficiencies to trade balances.\nA big opportunity for small businesses\nLeveraging digitization for exports is already taking place today. For example, Doris Canseco opened a traditional flower shop in Mexico, but the limited local market led her to move online. Using Google Ads to get the word out about her business, Flores de Oaxaca's customers in Europe, the United States and Canada, among other places. The business doubled in size and today online sales account for between 60 and 85 percent of its total revenue.\nSimilarly, Germ\u00e1n Garmendia was born in the small town of Copiap\u00f3, in the Atacama desert in Chile. A shy and quiet child, his mother signed him up for drama classes. A few years later, Germ\u00e1n started posting videos online. Today, he is one of the world\u2019s most popular YouTubers, with more than 43 million subscribers on HolaSoyGerman and 46 million on JuegaGerman, and has used the platform to break into other fields.\nDoris\u2019 and Germ\u00e1n\u2019s stories reflect a broader trend in Latin America and beyond, where digital tools are democratizing access to the global economy and creating new opportunities that didn\u2019t exist a generation ago. The new report suggests that governments, together with the private sector and civil society, should adopt policies and invest to reinforce this trend.\nCompelling data for governments and policymakers\nThe report looked at how policymakers can unlock export opportunities in a way that is inclusive and sustainable. Based on prior experience across Latin America, they identified 11 recommendations across five areas, which are aligned with the Digital Sprinters framework: \u2014 (1) lead from the top, (2) build physical capital, (3) develop human capital, (4) enhance competitiveness, and (5) enable technology usage. While progress and priorities vary among countries, the most common recommendations involve boosting digital infrastructure, digital skilling, digital security and policies that promote trade.\nHow Google is supporting economic inclusivity through exports\nThe report estimates that Google's digital products enabled 13% of the export growth across these economies in 2021. We are proud of this contribution and look forward to supporting future growth. We\u2019re also committed to supporting entrepreneurship and skills development across the region.\nWhen we opened our Google for Startups campus in Brazil in 2016, there were no \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 startups valued at $1 billion or more \u2013 in the region. Today, there are 35, including 13 that have been part of our Google for Startups programs. Many of these startups develop digital exports, provide their services across borders, and help traditional small businesses to grow. With investment, resources and training from Google, we have supported more than 450 startups in the region. These startups have gone on to raise more than $9 billion in investments while creating 25,000 jobs.\nWe\u2019re also supporting digital skills\u2014like cross-border marketing online \u2014 which are key to unlocking opportunities for entrepreneurs. Through our Grow with Google program and Google.org grantees, we\u2019ve trained nearly eight million people across Latin America in digital skills since 2017. To build on this momentum, we\u2019ve recently announced that we\u2019ll provide Google Career Certificate scholarships to train one million more people in Latin America \u2014 opening paths to well-paying jobs in high-growth fields.\nNext Steps\nAt a time of global macroeconomic uncertainty, it is more important than ever to double down on digitally-led trade growth . We hope this research we are releasing today sheds further light on the opportunities and policies needed to achieve them \u2014and helps communities and policymakers in Latin America as they seek to harness digital transformation to become Digital Sprinters.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Politics and Policy Analysis student at Bocconi University in Milan, shared her key takeaways from the experience:What was your motivation to apply for the program?I have always been interested in the interrelations between the private and public sector, especially regarding innovation, and wanted to understand the impact that policy firms and big tech have on the world around us. However, without an existing network, internships in the field are often limited and challenging to gain access to. When I first saw the program, I didn\u2019t think I had a chance, but when I saw that it focused on first-generation university students, I felt motivated to apply and showcase that diversity is in fact my strength.\nOur amazing first cohort of PSI scholars. Shivona is on the top right in a white shirt standing next to Mahreen Zaidi San Miguel, who was a coordinator of the program.\nHow has this experience prepared you for the next stage of your career?In the immediate term, I'll be staying on with the policy agency I interned with as a working student while I finish my studies. Being part of the PSI showed me that it's important to get a range of experience in different sectors, and that in order to really progress my career, I'll need to build a strong network of professional contacts. Being part of this program and working with fascinating and diverse individuals has given me a new sense of confidence, one that highlights that taking a unique path is key to a successful future.What was something you learned that was unexpected or surprising?My summer in Berlin was filled with surprises. I was unaware of the many facets of this sector and the incredible team effort involved in making it function. From the outside, it can appear as if policy-making is not something that businesses should be involved in, but rather something that should be left to the politicians. Instead, I have realized that both the public and the private are essential to one another and that they can only function with a well-coordinated network. I was also surprised on a personal and cultural level. Despite living in Italy, and being raised in Germany, I never realized that working cultures can be so different even within a country!Can you share an example over this summer where you brought a different perspective to the work you were doing?People in the tech and policy world can often get stuck in their own bubbles: Everyone has their own habits, organizational methods and ways of communicating. Being at a small policy firm that had just begun working with Google, I had the opportunity to develop methods and strategies to make collaboration and communication easier and more effective. I was especially involved in delivering new event formats and monitoring media updates. As a newcomer to the sector, I was able to highlight areas of ambiguity and improve existing organizational matters, facilitating workflow and workload.While the tech policy industry needs to do a lot more when it comes to diversity, I am proud of the results of this pilot program and look forward to continuing to work with our partners to build a robust, diverse talent pool that supports our industry\u2019s growth.\nPOSTED IN:\nDiversity and Inclusion\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nStudent Programs\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

Google participated in a range of UNGA-related engagements as part of our commitment to collaborate with international organizations to achieve collective solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing challenges. Here are just a few of the many topics we covered:\nGlobal governance in a digital era\nThe global internet was built to be a shared resource that everyone could access wherever they lived \u2014 but over the last few years this ideal has been increasingly challenged. Regulatory barriers to the free flow of information across borders are threatening to fragment the internet. New and revitalized global governance frameworks are needed for an increasingly digitized world, and international organizations will be critical to achieving them, which is why we support the UN Global Digital Compact.\nOver the course of this week, we had various conversations about what needs to be done to ensure that the internet remains open, secure and reliable for everyone. Preserving the cross-border availability of secure technologies and digital services \u2013 coupled with forward-looking decisions by governments to invest in digital infrastructure and digital skilling \u2013 can protect access to information everywhere and ensure that the benefits resulting from the global internet are preserved.\nKent Walker on stage with Foreign Policy Editor in Chief Ravi Agrawal at FP Tech Forum\nSupporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals\nProgress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was a key topic during this week\u2019s UNGA. The 17 UN SDGs were created \u201cto make a better world for everyone, now and into the future.\u201d They include goals like achieving gender equality, ensuring quality education and tackling economic inequality. At Google, we see countless ways in which technology can help accelerate progress on these goals.\nWhile the global community has made some important progress in meeting the SDGs since they were launched in 2015, headwinds persist due to Covid-19 and global conflict and, unfortunately, not a single country is on track to meet all 17 goals by 2030. To that end, Google's philanthropic arm, Google.org recently announced that we are expanding these efforts through a $25 million commitment to support NGOs and social enterprises using artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate progress in achieving the SDGs.\nJames Manyika, Jacquelline Fuller and UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed hosted a roundtable on using AI to accelerate the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. (L to R: Jacquelline Fuller - President of Google.Org, Elizabeth Cousens - President of UN Foundation, Paula Ingabire - Minister of Information Communications Technology and Innovation of Rwanda, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed, James Manyika - SVP of Technology & Society and UN Tech Envoy Amandeep Singh Gill).\nA number of the SDGs \u2013 ensuring sustainable cities, and access to affordable and clean energy, for example \u2013 were established with sustainability top of mind. And as our CEO has said before, solving climate change is humanity\u2019s next big moonshot. Working together, governments, companies, and citizens can create technology-enabled, scalable solutions that deliver a prosperous, carbon-free future for all of humanity.\nAs a company we've been carbon neutral since 2007, and by 2030 we aim to achieve net zero emissions across our operations and value chain, and to run our data centers and offices entirely on carbon-free energy. As we work towards these goals, we\u2019re collaborating with partners to share tools and resources to make clean energy achievable for all, such as the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Hub and Academy launched earlier this week. And we continue to partner with UN Energy, Sustainable Energy for All, and dozens of companies and cities around the world to grow the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact.\nUkraine\nThe war in Ukraine continues to be both a tragedy and a humanitarian disaster. Since the war broke out, our team has worked around the clock to combat disinformation, elevate authoritative content across our services, protect cybersecurity in Ukraine and globally, while also providing humanitarian assistance and supporting the region more broadly. This week, we were honored that Sundar was selected as a recipient of one of this year\u2019s Atlantic Council Global Citizen Awards, in recognition of Google\u2019s efforts in response to Russia\u2019s continuing war in Ukraine, our commitment to digital resilience, and our ongoing support for refugees and displaced people throughout the world.\nSundar Pichai delivers an acceptance speech at the Atlantic Council\u2019s 2022 Global Citizen Awards, highlighting the role the private sector can play in helping refugees around the world.\nInternational organizations like the United Nations are unique in their ability to convene countries from all over the world, and we are pleased to collaborate closely with member governments to play our part.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

This report covers 124 economies, is designed to help countries accelerate digital transformation, and a new online tool will allow anyone to assess how stronger, sustainable and inclusive growth can be achieved.\nThe world continues to face a great deal of uncertainty. The pandemic touched every corner of the globe; conflicts have wreaked havoc on food security and energy prices; and climate-related disasters are becoming all too frequent. Being prepared for uncertainty and ready to adapt to current and future challenges is more essential than ever.\nCentral to this idea of readiness is digital transformation \u2014 no longer seen as a luxury, but a necessity. We have witnessed unprecedented technological advancements in the last few decades that have brought us closer together and made our societies and economies more interconnected. New possibilities have emerged from the digital revolution, including new ways to address long-standing challenges and the promise of a more equitable and sustainable future. Despite the acceleration of digital transformation that we\u2019ve seen, there are still numerous issues to address before technology\u2019s potential can be fully realized.\n\u201cThe Digital Sprinters\u201d\nWith this context in mind, we launched our Digital Sprinters initiative in November 2020, aiming to provide a blueprint for emerging countries to accelerate their digital transformation.\nAs we shared in our Digital Sprinters 2020 report and framework, digital transformation will require investment by governments and the private sector in infrastructure, people, technological innovation and public policies:\nInfrastructure: Investing in digital connectivity and secure and environmentally sustainable infrastructure. It\u2019s not just about investment but also how the infrastructure is managed.People: Preparing people across all communities for the jobs of the future.Technological innovation: Deploying technological innovation that can unlock new opportunities. Increasing the use of data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing, which empower the growth of next-generation technologies. This means new opportunities alongside new questions about how best to harness these technologies.Public policies: Supporting a regulatory ecosystem that promotes competitiveness. Advancing policies that encourage competitive and open markets, interoperable regulatory standards, and tax regimes that are predictable and based on international standards.\nThe Future Readiness Economic Index\nBuilding on the Digital Sprinters framework, in 2021 Google commissioned the Portulans Institute\u2019s first edition of the Future Readiness Economic Index (FREI). The index gives governments, businesses and analysts comprehensive metrics and milestones to assess their digital transformation.\nThat original index focused on 27 countries \u2014 but future readiness matters globally. That\u2019s why today we\u2019re launching Portulans Institute\u2019s first global Future Readiness Economic Index at the 2022 United Nations General Assembly. The report covers 124 economies and helps countries in assessing how ready they are for the future, and how they can accelerate their digital transformation for stronger, sustainable and inclusive growth.\nAssessing trends is an inexact science. But by breaking down the data in critical areas like infrastructure, talent development, skills matching, and technology adoption, the Future Readiness Economic Index can help countries focus their efforts to get the biggest returns on investment. For example, the Index suggests that the United Arab Emirates, which ranks 27th globally on the Index, could sprint ahead by encouraging greater research and innovation in emerging digital technologies like cloud, AI and machine learning; while Mexico, which ranks 62nd on the index, would benefit from expanding Internet access and bandwidth, as well as improve energy consumption efficiency.\nThis year\u2019s report is accompanied by an online tool that will allow anyone interested in digital transformation to simulate, compare and assess how it can be achieved.\nSeizing the opportunity to sprint ahead\nGenerally speaking, the most future ready economies are mostly high-income countries, with Singapore leading the world in this regard. Those that score highly all have in common solid institutions and infrastructure, and good all-around performances across all FREI pillars.\nMany emerging countries are lagging in future readiness \u2014 held back by weaknesses across all four pillars. Accelerating digital transformation would be a game changer for such countries. In fact, according to a Digital Sprinters study by the strategic economics consultancy AlphaBeta, accelerating digital transformation could add half a trillion dollars to the annual GDP of three African countries (Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa), and over a trillion dollars to the annual GDP of the six largest economies in Latin America, by 2030. In this journey emerging countries have a key advantage. Unlike more developed economies, they can leapfrog ahead, building advanced tools from scratch rather than upgrading or replacing outdated legacy infrastructure.\nThere is no \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach to becoming future-ready. Countries should pick and choose the tools best suited to their needs and objectives. The Index provides some objective comparisons to help determine which policies, technologies, and balance of human capital, infrastructure and other critical elements might work best.\nBy highlighting the gaps in policy, technology, human capital and physical capital, the Future Readiness Economic Index is aimed at providing governments around the world with insights on both challenges and opportunities. We hope it can equip them with some helpful tools to spur future progress.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

{"date": "2022-07-19 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "Transparency in the shadowy world of cyberattacks", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/transparency-in-the-shadowy-world-of-cyberattacks/", "post_text": "The following is adapted from remarks delivered by Kent Walker, President of Global Affairs, at the International Conference on Cyber Security 2022 on July 19, 2022.\nThank you for the chance to be a part of this important conversation about cybersecurity.\nAt Google we\u2019re proud to say that we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. But that wasn\u2019t always the case.\nSo let me start by telling you a story about how we got it wrong, and two things we all can learn from that experience. My dad always told me that it was cheapest to learn from the other guy\u2019s mistake. So let me tell you about one of ours.\nAs some of you may recall, in late 2009, Google was the victim of a major cybersecurity attack, code named Operation Aurora.\nWe\u2019ve long had some of the most attacked websites in the world. But Aurora was something special.\nAurora was an attack attributed to the Chinese government, a significant security incident that resulted in the theft of intellectual property from Google.\nBut Aurora wasn\u2019t just any security incident. And it wasn\u2019t just against Google.\nAs part of our investigation we discovered that several other high-profile companies were similarly targeted. Other companies either hadn\u2019t discovered the attacks, or hadn\u2019t wanted to disclose them. When I was a federal prosecutor specializing in technology crimes, one of the biggest challenges we encountered was getting companies to go public or even come to the authorities.\nSo we felt it was important to talk about the attack\u2013to tell the world about its impact, the methods of the hackers, and the sectors at risk.\nWe worked with the US Government to share threat vectors and vulnerabilities.\nAnd we didn\u2019t stop there: After Aurora, we launched an entire team called Project Zero to find and promptly disclose previously undiscovered, zero-day vulnerabilities in our own and other companies\u2019 software, raising the security bar for everyone.\nAnd today, Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, or TAG, works to counter a range of persistent threats from government-backed attackers to commercial surveillance vendors to criminal operators. TAG does regular public disclosures of foreign state actor attacks, including doing the difficult work of attribution.\nSo I\u2019d say that the first lasting lesson from the Aurora attack is the need to weave openness and transparency into the fabric of a cybersecurity response. It\u2019s not always comfortable work\u2013we\u2019ve had to have some tough conversations with partners and with our own teams along the way\u2013but it\u2019s necessary to move the industry forward and ensure bugs are getting fixed fast, before they can be exploited in the wild.\nIn the ensuing years, we\u2019ve developed principles to ensure we can share learnings about vulnerabilities, cyber attacks (such as attacks on elections), and disinformation campaigns responsibly, transparently, and helpfully with the public, with our partners, and with law enforcement.\nAnd the US government has in turn stood up its own process to facilitate more information sharing with industry partners in order to expedite patches that safeguard us all.\nBut the value of transparency isn\u2019t the only reason I bring up the Aurora story.\nAurora not only taught us the need to embrace transparency, it also taught us a second, and even more important lesson: What works and what doesn\u2019t when it comes to security architecture.\nIt\u2019s possible to over-index on info sharing alone.\nFocusing on the fundamentals of software security is in some ways more important to raise all of us above the level of insecurity we see today.\nWe curate and use threat intelligence to protect billions of users\u2013and have been doing so for some time. But you need more than intelligence, and you need more than security products\u2013you need secure products.\nSecurity has to be built in, not just bolted on.\nAurora showed us that we (and many in the industry) were doing cybersecurity wrong.\nSecurity back then was often \u201ccrunchy on the outside, chewy in the middle.\u201d Great for candy bars, not so great for preventing attacks. We were building high walls to keep bad actors out, but if they got past those walls, they had wide internal access.\nThe attack helped us recognize that our approach needed to change\u2013that we needed to double down on security by design.\nWe needed a future-oriented network, one that reflected the openness, flexibility, and interoperability of the internet, and the way people and organizations were already increasingly working.\nIn short, we knew that we had to redesign security for the Cloud.\nSo we launched an internal initiative called BeyondCorp, which pioneered the concept of zero trust and defense in depth and allowed every employee to work from untrusted networks without the use of a VPN. Today, organizations around the world are taking this same approach, shifting access controls from the network perimeter to the individual and the data.\nIf you fast forward to today\u2019s hybrid-cloud environment, zero trust is a must.\nAt the core of zero trust is the idea that security doesn\u2019t have a defined border. It travels with the user and the data. For example, as the Administration pushes for multi-factor authentication for government systems, we\u2019re automatically enrolling users in two-step verification to confirm it\u2019s really them with a tap on their phone when they sign into our products.\nPractically, this means that employees can work from anywhere in the world, accessing the most sensitive internal services and data over the internet, without sacrificing security. It also means that if an attacker does happen to break through defenses, they don\u2019t get carte-blanche to access internal data and services.\nThe most impactful thing a company, organization, or government can do to defend against cyber-attacks is to upgrade their legacy architecture.\nIs it always easy? No, but when you consider that legacy architecture with its millions upon millions of lines of proprietary code, has thousands of bugs, each one a potential vulnerability, it\u2019s worth it.\nAnd beyond replacing existing plumbing, we need to be thinking about the next challenges, and deploying the latest tools.\nIn the same way the world is racing to upgrade encryption to deal with the threat of quantum decryption, we need to be investing in cutting-edge technologies that will help us keep ahead of increasingly sophisticated threats.\nThe good news is that cyber-security tools are evolving quickly, from artificial intelligence capabilities, to advanced cryptography, to quantum computing.\nIf today we talk about security by design, what comes next is security through innovation\u2013security designed with AI and machine learning in mind\u2013designed to counter bad actors using new tools to evade filters, break into encrypted communications, and generate customized phishing emails.\nWe\u2019ve got some of the best AI work in the business, and we\u2019re testing new approaches and using some of our leading-edge AI tools to detect malware and phishing at scale. AI allows us to see more threats faster, while reducing human error. AI, graph mining, and predictive analytics can dramatically improve our ability to identify and block phishing, malware, abusive apps, and code from malicious websites.\nWe look forward to sharing more of our findings so that organizations and governments can prepare. After all, this is no time for locking down learnings or successful techniques. Bad actors are not just on the lookout for ways to exploit your unknown vulnerabilities. As with Hafnium and SolarWinds, they are looking for the weak link in the security chain, letting them springboard from one attack to another. A vulnerability at one organization can do damage to entire industries and infrastructures.\nCybersecurity is a team sport, and we all need to get better together, building bridges not just within the security communities, but also between the national security community and academia and Silicon Valley.\nHaving started with one story, let me leave you with another\u2014cybersecurity and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.\nA lot has changed in our approach since Aurora. And perhaps no example illustrates that shift more clearly than our response to the war in Ukraine.\nRussia\u2019s invasion sparked, not just a military and economic war, but also a cyber war and an information war. In recent months, we have witnessed a growing number of threat actors\u2013 state actors and criminal networks\u2013using the war as a lure in phishing and malware campaigns, embarking on espionage, and attempting to sow disinformation.\nBut this time, we were ready with a modern infrastructure and a process for monitoring and responding to threats as they happened.\nWe\u2019ve sent thousands of warnings to users targeted by foreign-state actors\u2013a practice we pioneered after Aurora. And in the vast majority of cases, we\u2019ve blocked the attacks.\nWe launched Project Shield, bringing not just journalists, but vulnerable websites in Ukraine under Google\u2019s security umbrella against DDOS attacks. While you can DDOS small sites, it turns out that it\u2019s pretty tough to DDOS Google. We disrupted phishing campaigns from Ghostwriter, an actor attributed to Belarus. And we helped the Ukrainian government modernize its cyber infrastructure, helping fortify it against attack.\nWe are proud that we were the first company to receive the Ukrainian government\u2019s special peace prize in recognition of these efforts.\nBut the work is far from done.\nEven now, we\u2019re seeing reports that the Kremlin could be planning to ratchet up attacks and coordinated disinformation campaigns across Eastern Europe and beyond in an attempt to divide and destabilize Western support for Ukraine. In fact, just today, our TAG team published a new report on activity from a threat group linked to Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service, the FSB, and threat actors using phishing emails to target government and defense officials, politicians, NGOs, think tanks, and journalists.\nAnd, looking beyond Russia and Ukraine, we see rising threats from Iran, China, and North Korea.\nGoogle is a proud American company, committed to the defense of democracy and the safety and security of people around the world.\nAnd we believe cybersecurity is one of the most important issues we face.\nIt\u2019s why we invested $10 billion over the next five years to strengthen cybersecurity, including expanding zero-trust programs, helping secure the software supply chain, and enhancing open-source security.\nIt\u2019s why we\u2019ve just created a new division\u2013Google Public Sector\u2013focused on supporting work with the US government. And it\u2019s why we are always open to new partnerships and projects with the public sector.\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve worked with the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Taskforce to identify and counter align foreign influence operations targeting the U.S. We\u2019ve worked with the NSA\u2019s Cybersecurity Collaboration Center. And we\u2019ve joined the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative to help protect critical infrastructure and improve collective responses to incidents on a national scale.\nGetting our whole digital economy on the front foot is essential. And there\u2019s some encouraging progress. For example, we were glad to see last week\u2019s Cyber Safety Review Board report deeply investigating the log4j vulnerability and making important recommendations about how to improve the ecosystem.\nWe need more of that.\nLooking ahead, our collective ability to prevent cyber attacks will come, not only from transparency, but from a commitment to shoring up our defenses \u2014 moving away from legacy technology, modernizing infrastructure, and investing in cutting-edge tools to spot and stop tomorrow\u2019s challenges.\nWe can\u2019t beat tomorrow\u2019s threats with yesterday\u2019s tools. We need collective action to shore up our digital defenses. But by drawing on America\u2019s collective abilities and advantages, we can achieve a higher level of collective security for all of us.\nThank you.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  "}

Companies, governments, and policymakers must work together to create new legal and technical tools, set out interoperability standards, and most importantly, align on new frameworks to maintain both privacy and essential data flows.\nOne of these global solutions is the recently announced Global Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR), a privacy certification that will allow companies to demonstrate their compliance with government-approved requirements for data protection, backed by a review of those protections by a third-party. The Global CBPR system is an important step toward enabling continued, trusted data flows between participating jurisdictions, and Google is committing to certifying under the future Global CBPR system.\nHow collaboration will help ensure the future of data flows\nWhen governments announced the formation of the Global CBPR Forum earlier this year, designed to oversee the Global CBPR system, Google was honored to participate in the first meeting along with representatives from 20 jurisdictions. What we shared and heard from the governments at the Forum was a desire to solve the problem of trusted data flows together.\nAt the Global CBPR Forum, industry players and government representatives sounded a clear call for the certification program to find the right balance between holding companies accountable for their data use, protecting individuals from harm and misuse, and helping maintain the trust within the ecosystem that enables innovation and change, all while being globally scalable.\nThe Global CBPR system advances efforts to protect the digital ecosystem from fragmentation, which would come at a cost to access to information as well as opportunities and livelihoods for people around the world. This is a critical moment for governments to work with industry and other stakeholders to stabilize the regulatory landscape so that companies can confidently offer products and services that rely on international data flows without compromising privacy protections. The Global CBPR system is one step towards that clarity and security.\nNext steps for Google and the Global CBPR system\nOur investment in privacy and security is at the core of every product we build. We will bring this experience to the conversation to help build a robust Global CBPR system. We will work with our partners to provide input through the Global CBPR Forum on the practical realities of services facing fragmented privacy regulations. This global fragmentation is a challenge for any business, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who often don\u2019t have the resources to navigate a patchwork of laws. We also encourage the governments of the Global CBPR Forum to work with academics and civil society to understand how to make CBPR requirements scalable and able to bridge divergent legal requirements and cultural expectations of privacy.\nWe are also committed to finding ways to help and support Google customers to certify to this global standard, especially among small and medium enterprises. This kind of support will help scale these key privacy protections to more users, strengthening the businesses of our customers. We will continue to look for ways in the future to support participation in the US and globally in the CBPRs to raise privacy protections for users around the world.\nThe creation of the Global CBPR Forum is part of a global conversation on bringing strong, interoperable privacy protections to our users and the users of countless other companies around the world. We look forward to the Global CBPR Forum establishing new requirements and will certify to the system at the first opportunity.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

We\u2019re proud that Google Play helps developers build great apps and rewards them for doing so. And we know that a successful ecosystem must benefit both developers and consumers, which is why we have rules of the road to keep the store secure, protect privacy and prevent fraud. While we strive to make Google Play the best platform for everyone, Android also provides consumers and developers the opportunity to use other app store options.\nToday, we\u2019re pleased to share a proposed agreement that will help ensure that both developers and consumers can continue to benefit from Google Play. Google and a group of U.S. developers have reached a proposed settlement that allows both parties to move forward and avoids years of uncertain and distracting litigation.\nAs part of the settlement, we\u2019re establishing a $90 million fund to support U.S. developers who earned two million dollars or less in annual revenue through Google Play during each year from 2016-2021. A vast majority of U.S. developers who earned revenue through Google Play will be eligible to receive money from this fund, if they choose. If the Court approves the settlement, developers that qualify will be notified and allowed to receive a distribution from the fund.\nIn addition to the fund, we\u2019re committing to maintain a number of existing practices and implement new benefits that help developers innovate and communicate with their users:To continue to provide developers with a tiered pricing model, we\u2019ll maintain Google\u2019s 15% commission rate for the first $1 million in annual revenue earned from the Google Play Store for U.S. developers, which we implemented in 2021.We\u2019re revising our Developer Distribution Agreement to make it clear that developers can continue to use contact information obtained in-app to communicate with users out-of-app, including about subscription offers or lower-cost offerings on a rival app store or the developer\u2019s website.In new versions of Android, Google will maintain certain changes implemented in Android 12 that make it even easier for people to use other app stores on their devices, while being careful not to compromise the safety measures Android has in place.To showcase independent and small startup developers building unique high-quality apps, we\u2019re creating an \u201cIndie Apps Corner\u201d that will appear on the apps tab on the U.S. Google Play homepage and shine a spotlight on these developers.\nThese commitments, including the $90 million fund, build on a number of ways we already support developers, such as providing tools that help developers build great apps, lower their costs, and grow their businesses. In fact, compared to other prominent digital content stores, we provide developers more ways to interact with their customers.\nFinally, we\u2019ve heard developers want to understand more about how Google Play operates, which is why we\u2019ve agreed to publish annual transparency reports. The reports will share information about the Google Play Store, including statistics such as apps removed from Google Play, account terminations, and other data regarding how users interact with Google Play.\nWe\u2019re pleased that we worked with the developers to propose this agreement for the Court\u2019s approval. As the agreement notes, we remain confident in our arguments and case, but this settlement will avoid protracted and unnecessary litigation with developers, whom we see as vital partners in the Android ecosystem. We remain steadfast in our commitment to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers succeed.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

While Covid was first and foremost a health crisis, the economic impact continues to be severe for parts of the continent. The war in Ukraine has added further pressure on supply chains and food security. And Africa\u2019s rapid population growth - 60% of the population will be under 24 by 2025 - creates a further pressing need to generate economic opportunity and ensure people and families can earn a living.Despite the challenges ahead, the mood at CHOGM was optimistic, focusing on the collaboration and solutions that can help Africa\u2019s economic recovery. For me, harnessing technology is key to that.I grew up in Zimbabwe, then a Commonwealth country, and discovered the possibilities of the world of programming as a highschooler. Since then I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the role technology can play in creating opportunities and helping to solve large-scale societal problems. My position at Google allows me to focus on how technology can benefit society, and I feel fortunate that it\u2019s taken me back to Africa after just five months in the role.Google first bet on Africa with the investment in Seacom cable in about 2005: I remember hearing about it from my friends at Google at the time. Two years later, Google opened offices on the continent, and has been a partner in Africa\u2019s economic growth and digital transformation ever since - working with local governments, policymakers, educators and entrepreneurs. Our mission in Africa is to unlock the benefits of the digital economy to everyone - providing helpful products, programmes and investments.Africa\u2019s internet economy has the potential to grow to $180 billion by 2025 - 5.2% of the continent\u2019s GDP - bringing prosperity, opportunity and growth. African governments and businesses must turn that opportunity into a reality: integrating technology into the economy, ensuring no one is left behind, and emerging stronger from the current challenges.Ensuring affordable internet accessMost crucial to this is affordable internet access - a precondition for digital transformation, but still a barrier today. Across Africa, only 18% of households have an internet connection, and data costs remain a major obstacle. By actively promoting infrastructure investments, including in rural areas, Governments can support people to get online and harness the economic growth and benefits that will come with that.Google is already working in partnership with African governments to do this. We\u2019ve enabled over 100 million Africans to access the internet for the first time through our affordable Android devices, and plan to invest $1 billion over the next 5 years in projects that will help enable Africa\u2019s digital transformation, including our state-of-the-art Equiano subsea cable.The cable, which lands in Namibia in the next few weeks, will provide twenty times more network capacity by connecting Africa with Europe. It will run through South Africa, Namibia, Togo, Nigeria and St Helena, enabling internet speeds up to five times faster and lowering connectivity costs by up to 21%, in turn supporting growth and jobs.Investing in peopleThose accessing the internet need to be able to use it and transform their lives leveraging it. Working with tech companies and NGOs to foster digital skills developments, governments can ensure people can participate fully online.Google\u2019s CEO, Sundar Pichai, made a commitment in 2017 to train 10 million Africans in digital skills. To date, Google has trained more than 6 million people across Africa through Grow with Google in partnership with local governments, and given $20 million to non-profits helping Africans develop their digital skills. Moreover, Google has committed to certifying 100,000 developers - and so far has certified more than 80,000. Last year, a Google study showed the developer ecosystem in Africa is growing. There are nearly 716,000 professional developers across Africa - of which 21% are women; numbers we hope to contribute to.Investing in startupsAlongside digital skills, governments need to encourage entrepreneurs and startups - a crucial part of Africa\u2019s economic growth and jobs creation. There has never been a shortage of entrepreneurs in Africa - what is needed are the tools, including technology, and financing to enable them.Last year, we announced an Africa Investment Fund to support startup growth across Africa. Through the Fund, we invest $50 million in startups like SafeBoda and Carry1st, and provide Google\u2019s people, products and networks to help them build meaningful products for their communities. This is on top of our existing work on the Google for Startups Accelerator: Africa, which has provided more than 80 African startups with equity-free finance, working space and expert advisors over the last three years. We also expanded the Google for Startups Black Founders Fund in 2021, supporting Black African Founders like Shecluded, a digital financial growth resource and service startup for women.Using technological innovation to solve systemic challengesAdvances in technology are increasingly enabling solutions to development challenges, and with 300 million more people coming online in Africa over the next five years, the possibilities are endless. Digital finance, for example, can be used to address the barriers preventing nearly a billion African women from banking - while advances in AI have made it possible for Google to Translate more languages, including Luganda - spoken by 20 million people here in Rwanda and in neighboring Uganda.Technology offers Africa a tremendous opportunity for growth, prosperity and opportunity. I\u2019m hopeful that working in partnership, we can continue to make an impact and build on Africa\u2019s digital revolution.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Africa\n  \nNext Billion Users\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nGrow with Google\n  "}

One of those rules lets the government seek orders to prevent providers like Google from telling users about demands for data. These so-called Non-Disclosure Orders (NDOs) or \u201cgag orders\u201d have become commonplace.\nWe\u2019re seeing NDOs issued for an increasing number of court orders, warrants, and subpoenas from U.S. authorities. That means that providers can\u2019t notify users until long after compliance, if ever. And that people don\u2019t have the opportunity to go to court to contest disclosure orders.\nWe\u2019ve seen NDOs issued in cases where the user is already aware of the investigation, and even of the legal demand itself. Similarly, we\u2019ve seen NDOs issued covering legal requests for the data of well-established reputable organizations, even though notifying the organization is highly unlikely to do harm. And we\u2019ve seen some NDOs that might have been initially justified lasting years beyond the investigation, in some cases indefinitely.\nIt\u2019s time to reform this practice, requiring more robust review before gag orders are issued.\nWe commend the bipartisan House passage of the NDO Fairness Act, a bill sponsored by Chairman Nadler and Representative Fitzgerald that would make much-needed improvements to the Stored Communications Act. This reform will ensure that gag orders are issued only where warranted and for reasonable periods.\nThis position is nothing new for us. We\u2019ve long advocated for transparency for both our users and the public. We were the first major company to publish a Transparency Report on government requests for user data and co-founded both the Global Network Initiative and the Reform Government Surveillance coalition. We\u2019ve long supported surveillance reform, including the Email Privacy Act, and legislation to allow providers to be more open about national security requests. We also contest inappropriate gag orders, going to court where necessary (with one case leading the U.S. Department of Justice to pledge to stop using court orders to get journalists\u2019 information in leak investigations). We've also built industry-leading products to give business customers transparency and control over who has access to their data.\nTransparency for government data demands is an important check-and-balance, and we urge both the House and Senate to advance this practical protection for Americans in the digital age.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

While the tension had been building for weeks, that didn\u2019t make the invasion any less shocking.\nTanks once again rumbled through European streets, and the world held its breath. People wondered whether this marked a return to the law of the jungle \u2014 a return to machtpolitik over cooperation in solving shared problems.\nAnd we were reminded once again that democratic progress is not inevitable; that democracy and the rules-based international order are by no means guaranteed.\nEven before the invasion of Ukraine, there had been worrying signs that democracy was under assault.\nFreedom House found that the defining features of democracy \u2014 free expression and open debate, free association, and the rule of law \u2014 have retreated in nearly fifty countries.\nI\u2019d like to speak today about the debt technology owes democracy, and how technology can work with democracy to repay that debt.\nBut first, let\u2019s talk about why that partnership is so critically important.\nDemocracy has always been fertile soil for innovation and basic research.\nInventors flourish when they can exchange ideas, take risks, test hypotheses, and explore new avenues for inquiry and collective innovation.\nDemocratic values of openness and pluralism allow cooperation and scientific inquiry to flourish.\nIt would be hard to argue that the advances made possible by democratic innovation \u2014 advances that have doubled life expectancies and lifted billions of people out of poverty \u2014 would have been possible under any other system of government.\nBut technology can also benefit democracy itself, by proving that democracies can deliver for citizens, expanding choice and raising living standards.\nFuture generations of technology will help us combat climate change, pioneer personalized medicine, and improve agricultural productivity.\nBut even beyond improving living standards \u2014 delivering on the substantive promises of democracy \u2014 technology and innovation can also be a force for democratic procedural legitimacy: Supporting democratic institutions, increasing transparency and accountability in governance, and protecting and promoting human rights.\nWhen developed and used responsibly, technology can foster the essential exchange of ideas and broaden civic engagement in the democratic process.\nAfter all, democracies need at least three elements to flourish:\nA robust public square, where people can express ideas openly;An active and vibrant press; andFree and fair elections that create accountability, letting citizens check and balance power.\nWhile there is no question that the misuse and abuse of technology has created challenges in each of these areas \u2014 from within and without \u2014 conversations over the last few months, with defense leaders in Munich, business leaders in Davos, and security experts in Eastern Europe, have made it clear that we need the responsible use of technology to support these essential elements.\nSo, first, how can technology defend the public square, safeguarding speech and debate?\nTech can promote and protect the marketplace of ideas by playing both offense and defense: Facilitating free and open discourse while combating disinformation.\nThe early days of Silicon Valley fostered a faith that more communication would be better for the world. And in many ways it has been, connecting people in remarkable new ways.\nThat said, we have come to recognize abuses of our platforms, harmful efforts to spread malicious or patently false information. We have responded by removing content that violates our policies; raising authoritative voices at critical times; rewarding trusted creators; and reducing borderline content.\nThat requires tough calls \u2014 millions of them every day. And we\u2019re working on ways to provide more transparency into this critical process.\nThe latest and most dramatic chapter in the battle against disinformation came with the invasion of Ukraine where we all are witnessing not just a military and economic war, but also a cyber war and an information war.\nAn extraordinary situation called for an extraordinary response.\nYouTube took the unprecedented step of globally blocking disinformation channels like RT and Sputnik, removing more than 8,000 channels and more than 70,000 videos for violating our content policies \u2013 content that minimized the war\u2019s toll or spread harmful lies about what was happening on the ground. Meanwhile Google Search, Google News, and YouTube are some of the last independent sources of news about the war that remain available in Russia.\nOn the cybersecurity front, when we saw a spike of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on Ukrainian websites, we protected access to information and kept sites online by bringing publishers and government websites under Google's security umbrella, Project Shield.\nAs a result of these efforts, we were proud to be the first company to receive the Ukrainian government\u2019s special \"peace prize,\u201d showing how important tech\u2019s role can be when the stakes are high.\nWhich brings me to the second cornerstone of a functioning democracy: A free and vibrant press \u2013 and how technology can help it adapt to a digital world.\nGoogle was founded with the mission of organizing the world\u2019s information and making it universally accessible and useful. Over the years our ad networks have provided billions of dollars to news publishers, and we have sponsored programs like the Google News Initiative, partnering with publishers to create innovative tools and approaches to reporting.\nOf course, technology has had a significant impact on newspaper business models, unbundling different categories and making news more competitive and more freely available.\nBut technology will also be the key to the evolution of news business models for a digital era. As Herbert Simon said fifty years ago, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.\nThat means a growing role for editors and publishers, curators and analysts, who can help us all allocate our limited attention wisely.\nIt means there\u2019s a growing need for us to support content creators and a thriving global press.\nThird, technology has a vital role to play when it comes to the integrity of our elections.\nAt Google, we've long created tools and resources to make it easier for people to vote. Our services connect voters with up-to-date, authoritative information about polling locations, remote voting, and election times.\nDuring election cycles, campaigns face increased security threats.\nOur teams equip campaigns and election workers with best-in-class security tools. We collaborate with partners in Europe to give political campaigns access to free Titan Security Keys \u2014 the strongest form of two-factor authentication.\nThat\u2019s part of our Advanced Protection Program, which protects high-risk individuals \u2013 election officials, campaigns, journalists, and human rights activists \u2013 with access to high-visibility and sensitive information.\nFinally, our Threat Analysis Group works to thwart cyber attacks, monitoring and exposing espionage, hacks, and phishing campaigns and taking steps to disrupt the threats. In recent months, we stopped coordinated attacks by government-backed actors from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. And we stopped attempts by various unattributed groups to sow disinformation.\nOur role is clear \u2014 we help protect people and prevent future attacks by identifying bad actors and sharing relevant information.\nThese are all examples of ways tech is helping today \u2014 across the public square, the free press, and elections themselves. But defending democracy and the rules-based international order is a task that requires tech, civil society, and governments to work together.\nAn Edelman survey found that people often think of governments and NGOs as well intentioned but ineffective; and often think of companies as effective but maybe not always well intentioned. But when the two worked together, they went to the upper right-hand quadrant \u2014 both well intentioned and effective.\nIt\u2019s why we support The Copenhagen Pledge on Tech for Democracy and similar multilateral commitments by governments, organizations, industry, and civil society to make technology work for democracy and human rights.\nDemocracy is at a watershed moment. There\u2019s a risk that democracies turn inward, focusing strictly on domestic challenges rather than defending the liberal democratic international order.\nTech, too, is at a crossroads \u2014 with a risk that concerns about abuses of technology obscure its many benefits.\nIn 1996, John Perry Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, wrote \"A Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace\u201d arguing that the internet was beyond any government\u2019s laws.\nWell, perhaps it's now time for a \u201cDeclaration of Interdependence of Cyberspace.\u201d\nOur growing technological connections have become so important to our daily lives that technologists need to work ever more closely with governments on new and agile rules to promote progress, national security, and the defense of the public square.\nInternational frameworks \u2014 from the UN to the WTO to the OECD \u2014 can be useful starting places as we work to promote international alignment. And only governments can drive this crucial work.\nWe need governments committed to open, democratic processes to step up and work together to reaffirm international norms of access to information and the free and open exchange of ideas.\nAt Google, we\u2019re eager to roll up our sleeves and help.\nWe leave the politics to the politicians, but that doesn\u2019t mean we leave it to others to defend the public square. Nor does it mean we dismiss the experience and ideas of government leaders in the cause of protecting democracy.\nWe hear the summons to defend democracy\u2019s essential components \u2013 the open exchange of views, an independent press, and free and fair elections.\nIn moments of uncertainty and crisis, responsible tech companies feel a duty to do what our engineers do best: Unlock solutions to the most pressing problems.\nWe undertake that task with appreciation that those solutions will be \u2013 must be \u2013 the product of collaboration, building on the kind of collective innovation that has always made democracies stronger than their adversaries.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

We\u2019ve previously outlined how this proposal could make our services less helpful and less secure, while not addressing the issues Americans care about most \u2014 like privacy, child safety and inflation. As experts gather for the RSA Conference this week, I wanted to share my perspective as a security professional on the real risks that this legislation poses for U.S. security.Our security teams work around the clock, around the world, to identify and stay ahead of threats to our users and platforms. On a typical day, Google blocks more than 100 million phishing attempts across our platforms and tracks over 270 government-backed threat actors from more than 50 countries. This work requires us to make judgment calls quickly, based on indicators and alerts from a huge variety of sources. We don\u2019t always find fire where there\u2019s smoke. But we do prevent millions of attacks from succeeding \u2014 and responding to the smoke without hesitation is critical to protecting millions of internet users.A bill introduced in the Senate (S. 2992) could hurt our ability to make quick decisions to keep our products secure, requiring us to ask: would thwarting a potential bad actor violate the law and open us up to legal liability? Even pausing to ask the question would leave millions of users vulnerable for precious minutes while a potential security threat persists. And when it comes to cybersecurity, every second counts.Here are just a few ways the legislation would undermine our ability to keep people safe:\nHarming a security-by-default approachFirst, because the bill bans basic product integration, we might not be able to secure our products by default. This is problematic because modern threat actors don\u2019t just seek to exploit one user, service or system in isolation. They look for weak links, and their behavior is harder to detect when their activities are spread across multiple providers. That\u2019s why we build systems with integrated security defenses. For example, to counter a phishing attack, we rely on built-in spam filtering, malware scanning, link analysis, two-step verification for accounts, password alerts \u2026 the list goes on. Under the legislation, these seamless integrations could be prohibited simply because competitors offer their own versions of spam filtering, malware scanning and other security services. The bill could even require us to open our systems to untrusted and potentially vulnerable rival services.\nOpening our products to bad actorsSecond, the bill would require us to allow outside parties to \u201caccess or interoperate\u201d with our \u201cplatform, operating system, hardware and software features.\u201d This broad mandate to open our systems may have been written with domestic rivals in mind \u2014 but it would inevitably be exploited by foreign companies looking to understand U.S. technical infrastructure, and access data from American businesses and citizens. As national security leaders have warned: \u201cUnfettered access to software and hardware could result in major cyber threats, misinformation, access to data of U.S. persons, and intellectual property theft.\u201d\nRolling back efforts to fight disinformationThird, by prohibiting us from \u201cdiscriminating\u201d against competitors, the bill would prevent us from taking action against purveyors of malicious content. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, we have been able to move quickly to limit Russian propaganda and disinformation, even as that content has migrated to new channels. The proposed legislation could undermine this work.\nFailing to address valid security concernsFinally, this bill would create a legal environment that encourages companies to err on the side of not protecting users \u2014\u00a0and recent changes to the bill exacerbate these underlying security concerns. For example, the revised bill says that we don\u2019t have to interoperate with or provide access to data to entities who pose \u201cclear\u201d and \u201csignificant\u201d security risks. But this assumes that we know in real time which risks are significant, and could prohibit us from blocking moderate or emerging security risks that don\u2019t obviously meet the bar of a \u201csignificant\u201d threat. Another recent change says that we don\u2019t have to open our platforms up to businesses backed by the Chinese government. But this ignores the fact that modern threat actors use compromised third-parties or shell companies to conduct operations, where attribution can be slow and difficult.We understand there\u2019s an appetite for global regulation, and we support balanced, thoughtful legislation to solve important issues such as consumer privacy and child safety online. But this legislation would fundamentally harm our ability to stay ahead of threats and keep the billions of people who use our products secure. We strongly urge Congress to consider these unintended consequences before moving forward.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  "}

Last month, a delegation of our top security engineers and leaders met with organizations and individuals in Czechia, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia - they trained high risk groups, distributed security keys, engaged in technical discussions with government experts, and supported local businesses in shoring up their defenses.\nSecuring high-risk usersThroughout this war, there has been no shortage of news around targeted cyber attacks aimed at high profile individuals in this region. Our Threat Analysis Group has provided regular updates on this activity, and worked diligently to alert users, organizations and governments through our government-backed attacker warnings.To help address these threats, our high-risk user team conducted workshops throughout the region for dozens of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), publishers and journalists, including groups and individuals sanctioned by the Kremlin. We distributed around 1,000 security keys - the strongest form of authentication - and trained over 30 high risk user groups on account security. We also launched, in collaboration with Jigsaw, the Protect Your Democracy Toolkit, which provides free tools and expertise to democratic institutions and civil society.We heard directly from high-risk organizations like the Casimir Pulaski Foundation, the International Center for Ukrainian Victory, NGOs supporting refugees and exiled activists, and leading publishers across Europe who told us just how critical Google's no-cost security tools, like the Advanced Protection Program and Project Shield, are to keeping them safe online. We are grateful for their valuable insights to inform future product development.\nOur High-Risk team meets with NGO representatives at Google Prague\nShoring up cyber defensesAs companies and government agencies grapple with the ever changing security landscape and the role that they find themselves in during this conflict, we wanted to showcase how Google\u2019s enterprise security tools and advisory services can give them the confidence to pursue digital transformation on a secure foundation.Our delegation of security experts included leaders from the Google Cybersecurity Action Team (GCAT). This team\u2019s mission was to advise governments, critical infrastructure providers, enterprises, and small businesses on cloud security and IT modernization. We hosted round-table discussions with Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) from around the region to learn about the challenges they face, and shared resources on how they can accelerate their response to threats, secure their open source software supply chains, and stay up-to-date with evolving regulations.\nGoogle VP of Privacy, Safety & Security Royal Hansen meets with Polish minister Janusz Cieszy\u0144ski at the CYBERSEC Forum in Katowice\nBuilding stronger partnershipsWhile observers speculate about whether the war in Ukraine will lead to broader cyber escalation, government cybersecurity organizations in Central and Eastern Europe are contending with cyber conflict on a daily basis. That\u2019s why Google experts regularly meet with national cyber emergency response teams (CERTs), cybersecurity agencies, and digital ministries to promote the exchange of knowledge and build partnerships to advance shared goals.What we heard across the board was: we need to help our partners in the region address the shortage of cybersecurity skills and training; improve operational partnerships and information sharing; and promote better cyber hygiene for citizens. We are pleased to work with governments and industry to advance innovative solutions on all of these fronts. Deepening our partnerships in this region will not only protect our users, it will make the Internet safer for all.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Embracing economic engagement and digital trade \u2014 and strengthening the frameworks and capability to do that openly and responsibly \u2014 can help ensure recovery in the Indo-Pacific region is more inclusive and sustainable. In this way, we can also build greater trust and confidence for the future.An inclusive, sustainable and digitally-enabled recovery will not happen automatically. It requires collective action by governments, the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders to ensure that digital technologies are widely accessible and that everyone has the skills needed to harness those technologies. New tools, rules and partnerships are needed to foster greater regulatory alignment and interoperability, to ensure the benefits of the digital economy are felt more widely, and in order to address cross-border digital challenges.That\u2019s why we welcome the announcement in Tokyo today to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). IPEF promises a new mode of economic cooperation to maximize the opportunities that arise from the global digital economy. We hope that IPEF will advance a strong, affirmative digital trade agenda which will promote:Inclusive trade. 78 million workers across countries in the Asia-Pacific region require digital skills training to keep pace with technological advancements. Google and others have been working to address these gaps \u2014 for example, since 2015, Google has trained over 58 million people in Asia in digital skills under our Grow with Google program. But frameworks like IPEF can help ensure coordinated action -\u2014 including by sharing best practices, incentivizing public-private partnerships, and developing joint strategies. IPEF should also address barriers that make it uniquely difficult for small businesses to reach foreign markets, like requirements to open a local office as a condition to do business.Openness and non-discrimination. IPEF should look to apply traditional trade principles such as openness and non-discrimination to the digital economy. It should ensure that data can flow freely across borders. It should enable businesses of all sizes to provide digital products and services free of discrimination, while allowing for appropriate guardrails. And it should enable consumers to access and use services and applications of their choice on the internet.Trust and shared values. IPEF should be a model to show that data flows and privacy protection can be mutually reinforcing concepts for building trust in the digital economy and cross-border digital transactions. IPEF participants could also commit to greater collaboration on cybersecurity, and safeguard against the use of censorship as a trade barrier or a means to access private data.Resilient and green digital infrastructure. IPEF should promote adoption of green digital infrastructure \u2014 for example, by incentivizing the use of cloud services that meet international standards for energy efficiency. IPEF should also promote a resilient and secure digital infrastructure, including by ensuring sound, non-discriminatory regulation of submarine cables.IPEF is particularly significant given the region\u2019s size and innovativeness. The Indo-Pacific region represents nearly two-thirds of the global economy, and is second only to the U.S. when it comes to the number of \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 companies that are valued at $1 billion and above. It is the perfect place to try to ensure that the promise of the digital economy is fully realized and shared.This is the moment for Indo-Pacific countries to chart a bold, inclusive and sustainable path forward to address common challenges and seize the tremendous opportunities the digital economy can bring.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Asia\n  "}

We are currently defending these points in court against Match Group, and at the court's request, on May 19 we reached a temporary agreement while the case is being heard and we prepare our planned countersuit.On May 20, Match Group disregarded the stipulations it agreed to in court with a misleading press release that mischaracterizes what happened in the proceeding. We want to once again set the record straight to make sure the rest of the developer ecosystem is aware of the facts.The court asked us temporarily not to remove Match Group\u2019s apps from the Play Store on June 1 for its violation of our terms until a full trial in exchange for the following:Match Group has to put up to $40 million in an escrow account to begin to account for the service fees it owes us.Match Group must also provide Google with a monthly accounting of all in-app sales of digital goods and services from June 1 through trial so we can track what it owes for the immense benefit it receives from Google Play.Match Group must work in good faith to further enable Google Play\u2019s billing system as an option for users. Google agreed to work in good faith to continue to develop additional billing system features that are important to Match Group, as Google has already been doing for years with countless developers, including Match Group.And Match Group\u2019s claim that it can't integrate Play\u2019s billing system because it lacks key features contradicts the fact that Match Group has been proactively and successfully using Play\u2019s billing in more than 10 of its apps. Match Group collected hundreds of millions in consumer revenue in over 50 countries through Google Play\u2019s billing last year.Not only are we confident we\u2019ll succeed in defending against Match Group\u2019s unfounded complaint, we will be filing a countersuit against Match Group for violating their obligations under the Developer Distribution Agreement and to ensure Google Play remains a trusted destination for users.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

I\u2019m honored to be here today and to get to meet with so many of you who are working on this day in and day out.As governments in this region and elsewhere in the world tackle this issue we want to ensure we are doing everything we can to support those efforts. Google\u2019s mission has always been about organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful. The work we\u2019re doing to ensure people can get access to quality information \u2014 and do so safely \u2014 has never been more important than it is today.\nSecuring users in Ukraine and the broader regionAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfolded, Google mobilized to help the people of Ukraine and protect the security of our users and services \u2013 an area where we are uniquely positioned to help in this conflict.We have our own specialized teams dedicated to identifying, tracking, and countering threats from government-backed actors.Russia-backed hacking and influence operations are not new to us; we\u2019ve been tracking and taking action against them for years. To put this into perspective, we\u2019ve seen and worked to disrupt Russian operations targeting the U.S. elections in 2016 and 2017 and campaigns targeting the 2018 Olympic games. In October, we blocked a Russian campaign targeting 14,000 Google users.And we\u2019ve seen first hand the targeting of Ukraine by Russia. It has been ongoing for years with both espionage and occasional cyber attacks tracked by our teams. As the war intensified, we also saw Russian threat actors shift focus to targets elsewhere in Eastern Europe.Our Threat Analysis Group (TAG), regularly publishes details on campaigns it detects, and disrupts these efforts to help governments and private sector companies better defend their systems.We\u2019ve seen threat actors beyond Russia shift their focus and targeting, including a growing number of threat actors using the war as a lure in phishing and malware campaigns. This includes government-backed actors from China, Iran, North Korea, Belarus and financially-motivated, criminal actors using current events as a means for targeting users.For example, we\u2019ve seen one cyber crime group impersonating military personnel to extort money for rescuing relatives in Ukraine.In addition to disrupting threats, we are doing everything we can to increase protections for high risk users and organizations in Ukraine. We\u2019ve redoubled our efforts to offer free tools to help \u2013 including protecting hundreds of high risk users on the ground with our Advanced Protection Program, and expanding eligibility of Project Shield to include the Ukraine government. Shield is currently protecting over 200 websites in Ukraine from distributed denial of service attacks.It is in this spirit of action that we are expanding our partnerships and investment in the broader region on cybersecurity.In fact, this week a delegation of our top security engineers and leaders are on the ground across Eastern Europe to provide hands-on training to high risk groups, deliver security keys and support local businesses as they look to improve their security posture.To share what we know about the threat, we are engaging in technical exchanges with governments in the region.We\u2019re providing free tools and expertise to democratic institutions and civil society, such as the Protect Your Democracy Toolkit \u2014 which we launched today in partnership with our Jigsaw team.We\u2019re also investing in, and shaping, the next generation of cybersecurity professionals. For example, Google has committed to provide scholarships for 150,000 people in Europe, the Middle East and Africa through the new Google Career Certificate training.We\u2019re also helping governments and businesses stay ahead of the threat, including helping government agencies, companies and utilities who rely on outdated hardware and software to replace old systems with better foundations and we are here to build up businesses and governments\u2019 confidence to embrace digital transformation securely.\nGoogle\u2019s approach to securityWe believe we are uniquely positioned to help users, organizations, and governments in this region because of our approach to security.First, we focus on the basics. We bake in security from the beginning instead of bolting it on as an afterthought and we design helpful products that are secure by default for our users. In fact, we are the first consumer tech company to automatically turn on 2 step verification, our version of multifactor authentication, or MFA, for our users. We recommend businesses and governments focus on these fundamentals as well.Second, we take an open and interoperable approach to security, and we invest to ensure this model of the Internet as a whole is protected. In today\u2019s interconnected environment, our collective security is only as strong as the weakest link. Our business cannot thrive if people don\u2019t feel safe online. That\u2019s why we design solutions that eliminate entire classes of threats from being effective both on our platforms, and across the Internet as a whole.Finally, and perhaps most importantly \u2013 we are looking at the future of cybersecurity and investing in advanced, state-of-the-art capabilities. We know that cyber threats evolve quickly \u2013 as soon as a new technology is introduced or adopted, there are threat actors and cyber criminals looking for ways to exploit it. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not enough to just stay a few steps ahead of the threat.We need to invest in the future of technology, from cutting-edge artificial intelligence capabilities, to advanced cryptography, to quantum computing \u2013 our teams are already working on the future of cybersecurity. And we see it as part of our mission to ensure that we open source and share these findings so that organizations and governments can stay ahead of the latest cyber threats.\nSecurity-proofing our tech policiesOur approach enables us to weather online security threats. But advanced capabilities are not enough if government policies inadvertently undermine our ability to protect users.I support smart tech regulation, which can fuel the vitality of the Internet and ensure technology is meeting society's needs. Unfortunately, some technology regulation is not adequately considering the impact to safety and security efforts online.For example, some policies seek to limit sharing of data between different services on platforms\u2019 like ours, but overly-broad bans on cross-platform data sharing also have significant implications for the threat intelligence work I mentioned earlier.The ability to share intelligence on threat actors and their technical signatures helps identify and stop the work of threat actors and cybercriminals. It protects not just one company or two companies, but the Internet as a whole.To realize the full benefits of technology to society, society must be able to trust that the technology they are using is safe and secure. By ensuring security has a seat at the table in these policy discussions, we can strike this balance and unlock technology\u2019s full potential. Today\u2019s conflict and challenges point to a need for better cooperation and giving technical experts a seat at the table in these policy discussions.We applaud the Declaration for the Future of the Internet, which calls on governments and industry to protect a future for the Internet that is open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure.At our core, Google is an Internet company, and our fate is tied to the Internet remaining true to these principles. The internet itself is a multi-stakeholder system, and protecting users and citizens online requires cooperation among us, governments and businesses.It\u2019s never been more urgent, and our ability to make a difference is greater than anyone anticipated. We all must work together to protect this future, whether that means combating cyber threats, building safe technologies that unlock society\u2019s full potential, or developing responsible technology policies.We stand ready to partner with governments, businesses, and individual users to see this future secured.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

That\u2019s because we\u2019ve earned the trust of billions of users as a safe place to find great apps and games. Google Play\u2019s billing is an important part of our business model, and it allows us to provide consumers with critical safety protections from things like payment fraud and subscription abuse. But Match Group would have you believe that all Google Play provides is payment processing. This simply isn\u2019t true, and Match Group knows it.Match Group knows Google Play provides tools and a global distribution platform that helps developers grow their business. And Match Group knows this because they have used these tools and our platform to build a very successful global business. They want access to Google Play\u2019s global distribution platform and users, they want to unfairly leverage Google\u2019s substantial investments in the platform, and they want it all for free.Many other developers recognize the value of Google Play and are partnering with us to grow the ecosystem in a responsible way, but Match Group is attempting to freeload off our investments rather than being a responsible partner. Now, after years of reaping the benefits of Google Play, Match Group is doing all it can to avoid paying for the enormous benefits it receives\u2013including misusing the courts, lobbying policymakers, and even suggesting to investors that alternative billing systems would exempt them from paying for the valuable services they receive from Google Play.And because Match Group doesn\u2019t believe it should have to pay anything for the substantial services we provide, it\u2019s willing to compromise user safety as part of a global campaign to smear our business and how we operate. We think the facts speak for themselves:Our fees cover the full range of services that Google Play provides, not just payment processing. Just as it costs money to build an app, it costs money to build a platform. Android and Google Play have expanded consumers\u2019 access to affordable devices and services, provided cutting edge technologies to empower developers to build new features and experiences, put a global consumer base within reach for businesses around the world, and kept consumers safe on their devices at a scale that\u2019s unparalleled. Because of the investments we\u2019ve made, Google Play has built a dedicated consumer base of more than 2.5 billion 30-day active users in 190 countries around the world. It\u2019s no small feat to earn that kind of loyalty, and the trust we\u2019ve built has created economic opportunity for millions of developers that have built great businesses with us. Our service fee helps sustain this thriving app and game ecosystem.Our fees are the lowest among major app stores. Google Play is the first major platform to move away from one-size-fits-all pricing to meet developers\u2019 different needs. Today, just around 3% of developers are subject to a service fee and 99% of those developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. Match Group\u2019s apps, for example, are eligible to pay just 15% on Google Play for digital subscriptions, which is the lowest rate among major app platforms. Developers have praised our approach. Match Group claims that they\u2019d suffer if they complied with our policies, but they already comply with the policies of other app stores that charge much more than Google Play.Regulators are investigating Match Group\u2019s safety problems. Match Group wants to continue imposing its own billing system, a billing system that has repeatedly faced regulatory scrutiny for things like subscription fraud. Google Play\u2019s billing system is focused on protecting users from these same types of abusive practices by providing transparency and easy-to-use features to manage purchases and subscriptions. Match Group may not like these protections, but consumers do.Match Group has had ample time to make changes. Match Group has known about Google Play\u2019s billing requirement for years, and certainly since September 2020 when we began to bring previously non-compliant apps onto Google Play\u2019s billing system. For the few developers like Match Group that weren\u2019t offering Google Play\u2019s billing to their users, we provided an additional 18 months to give the entire developer community ample time to make any necessary changes.Match Group isn\u2019t interested in true user choice billing. While Match Group claims to support user choice, it has yet to offer its users that option in South Korea, where user choice billing is now available on Google Play. Likewise, they inaccurately allege that users \u201csometimes\u201d pick Match Group\u2019s billing 3 to 1 over Google Play. But many of their apps only offer Match Group\u2019s billing. In the cases where Google Play is theoretically a user choice, it isn\u2019t presented as a fair choice and is hidden in small text at the very bottom of the app.We\u2019re the only major app store piloting true user choice billing. We recently announced a pilot to invite developers to help us test and iterate on user choice billing in other markets outside South Korea. We started with Spotify as our first partner as they have made substantial investments in the platform and have deep product integrations across all of Android\u2019s form factors. We are actively looking to add more partners in the coming months and developers can express interest.Android is the only mobile platform that offers Match Group alternative distribution choices. More than half of Android devices come preinstalled with 2 or more app stores. Android is a uniquely open operating system and provides Match Group with multiple ways of distributing their apps to users outside of Google Play, including through other Android app stores, or directly to users via their website. And Match Group can of course distribute through Google Play as consumption-only apps.As a platform, we\u2019re always looking to work in good faith with partners to grow and evolve the ecosystem, but we\u2019ll stand firm against false attacks on our business, especially when it puts users at risk and endangers our ability to continue investing in and serving our developer community.No other mobile platform is as open as Android, and no other platform has shown more willingness to champion user choice, invest in change or collaborate with developers. Google remains focused on helping developers succeed and we look forward to continuing to work with our partners to grow and improve Google Play.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Over the last few years, this ideal has been strained to the breaking point as governments around the world have adopted conflicting regulations that are fragmenting the internet to the detriment of people everywhere.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s great to see countries coming together today to launch the Declaration for the Future of the Internet (DFI). Through this effort, allies across the public and private sectors will work together to protect the importance of the global web, including by opposing shutdowns and other \u201cefforts to splinter the global Internet.\u201d\nDigital fragmentation impacts everyone using the internet. As conflicting regulations proliferate, people\u2019s access to content, privacy protections, and freedom to transact and communicate increasingly vary depending on where they are located. Digital fragmentation has become a significant barrier to international trade, with a particularly pernicious effect on small businesses, which lack the resources to navigate an array of conflicting rules. And it discriminates against smaller, developing countries, as new products become harder to launch and scale on a fragmented Internet to all markets.\nThe DFI provides a path to address the most urgent threats to the global internet. In particular, we\u2019re seeing a number of governments take actions to crack down on the free flow of information and ideas, increase government surveillance, and restrict access to cross-border internet services under the banner of \u201ccyber-sovereignty.\u201d\nThe DFI joins the EU-US Trade & Tech Council and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework as important fora where like-minded partners can join together to address cross-border challenges. We hope this work will be grounded in a few key principles:\nFirst, governments should strive to agree on common standards to guide the development of new rules for digital technologies, so that consumers have consistent protections across borders and access to digital tools.Second, governments should strive to increase interoperability between national digital rules, as we\u2019ve seen with the US-EU Data Privacy Framework.Third, governments should commit to intergovernmental regulatory dialogue to ensure that new rules strengthen shared values.And fourth, governments should abide by core open trade principles like non-discriminatory approaches to regulation that don\u2019t single out foreign companies.\nThe private sector also plays an important role in maintaining the global internet. That\u2019s especially true in times of crisis, as security teams work to disrupt disinformation campaigns, cyber attacks and other online threats. Since Russia\u2019s invasion in Ukraine, our teams have been working around the clock to support people in Ukraine through our products, defend against cybersecurity threats, and surface high-quality, reliable information. We are committed to partnering with governments and civil society through the Declaration to disrupt disinformation campaigns and foreign malign activity, while ensuring people around the world are able to access trustworthy information.\nUltimately, the cross-border availability of secure technologies and digital services \u2013\u00a0coupled with forward-looking decisions by governments \u2013 can protect access to information everywhere and ensure that the enormous benefits resulting from the global internet are not lost. We stand ready to support the DFI\u2019s mission to promote an open, secure, and reliable internet for all.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2022-04-28 10:00:00+00:00", "title": "Reforming the patent system to support American innovation", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/reforming-the-patent-system-to-support-american-innovation/", "post_text": "Over the years, Google has worked to ensure that the United States patent system continued to spur new inventions and technologies. A healthy patent system incentivizes and rewards the most original and creative inventors \u2014 while helping others build on existing ideas and avoiding frivolous litigation. Supporting that balanced approach, we were one of the first companies to pledge not to sue any user, distributor, or developer of open-source software on specified patents, unless first attacked. We helped found the License on Transfer (LOT) Network, which shields its members from being sued over patents that other members have sold to patent trolls. And we worked in collaboration with others to create a repository of hard-to-find \u201cprior art\u201d documents to improve the patenting process, resulting in higher quality patents.\nWe have also invested heavily in patenting our engineers\u2019 inventions in advanced technologies. Our tens of thousands of engineers have authored over 42,000 home-grown patents and we have licensed hundreds of thousands more at fair value. We are proud of our patented innovations like the ability to predict traffic or extend battery life. And we have sold hundreds of patents to smaller companies interested in bolstering their own portfolios.\nBut we are concerned that America\u2019s patent system is increasingly failing to promote the cause of innovation and progress. The quality of patents issued in the U.S is declining. And, after a few years where earlier reforms reduced abusive patent litigation, it\u2019s back with force, with 46% more lawsuits in 2021 than in 2018. Patent trolls and opportunistic companies have begun to weaponize patents against their rivals, hindering both competition and innovation, and ultimately harming the quality of new products. America\u2019s prized \u201cculture of innovation\u201d is being undermined by a \u201cculture of litigation.\u201d\nReversing the rising tide of wasteful patent litigation\nAggressive litigants waste valuable court resources unsuccessfully trying to stretch patents beyond recognition. And prolific patent trolls wage litigation shakedown campaigns with low-quality patents that are later found to be invalid, wasting time and resources that could have been spent on developing new products.\nGoogle is a resourceful company with a strong record of fighting overreaching patent claims, and we can defend our users and products. But many smaller companies, especially those producing nascent technologies, cannot afford the risk and expense of these lawsuits, which raise costs for consumers and stifle companies\u2019 ability to bring products to market. That is why we are calling for more support for the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO), reforms to how the judicial system handles patent claims, and Congressional changes to address patent abuse.\nInvesting in the Patent Office\nEach year, the PTO approves more than half of the more than 600,000 patent applications it receives, working to balance incentives for investment and freedom to innovate. Evaluating those applications is a monumental task and in recent years the agency has not had the tools it needs to do its job right. Technology can help, and the PTO is working on AI solutions to streamline the process. But its hard-working employees remain under-resourced to keep up with advancing technology. This results in invalid patents getting issued to inventors, which undermines their ability to protect technology confidently. Others face the cost and hassle of defending infringement claims against patents that should never have been granted in the first place. This isn\u2019t fair for anyone except patent trolls.\nEnding forum shopping\nThere are 677 federal district court judgeships in the United States. But many companies suing over patent claims are gaming the system. This forum shopping has gotten so out of hand that almost 25% of all US patent litigation is now being filed in a single courthouse. After a bipartisan request for action, Chief Justice John Roberts has committed to investigate the issue and push to restore the integrity of the judicial process.\nRestoring Inter Partes Review\nOn top of all this, changes to PTO rules have weakened Inter Partes Review (IPR), the program that Congress created to help companies cost-effectively invalidate low-quality patents. Congress carefully constructed the IPR program to provide expert review of the small subset of patents with the greatest impact on our economy. But new PTO policies make it harder to use IPRs to invalidate patents in a cost-effective and streamlined way.\nPreserving America\u2019s culture of innovation\nA series of steps would improve the current system, benefiting both innovation and consumers:\nAt the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a new director is now at the helm, with a clear mandate to improve patent quality as set out in the Commerce Department\u2019s Strategic Plan. To do so, the Office should work to ensure that the agency\u2019s process for reviewing an application for a patent is robust, and that patents that shouldn\u2019t have been granted can be promptly, efficiently, and effectively challenged. Of course, that will require giving the PTO the resources it needs. The PTO is funded by fees paid by patent applicants, and we support increasing fees for the largest patent filers, including Google. With the confirmation of PTO Director Kathi Vidal, this important work can finally begin.In the judiciary, the Supreme Court\u2019s year-end report on the federal judiciary made the issue of forum shopping one of three topics of focus for 2022. As the review requested by the Chief Justice moves forward, we hope it urgently addresses the judicial imbalances caused by abusive forum shopping.Finally, before Congress, there is pending, bipartisan legislation that would help reduce abusive patent litigation. We are supportive of the goals of this bill, which would restore access to the Inter Partes Review program and increase transparency and accountability. It makes clear that the PTO is the most effective forum for reviewing patent validity, giving the Office the opportunity to double-check its own work in an efficient, expert, and cost-effective way. We and a broad cross-section of supporters rallied behind this program back in 2011 when it was enacted as part of the America Invents Act with resounding bipartisan support, and it\u2019s time to live up to its original purpose.\nWith changes like these, we are optimistic that the patent system can get back to what it is intended to do: preserve the U.S. culture of innovation, advance the development of new technology, and reward entrepreneurs who are building new products that benefit American consumers and people around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Google also published an accompanying white paper on Responsible Data Practices.\nInformation is all around us. Americans sometimes take it for granted, but from the moment we walk out our front doors, information powers everything we do.After a two-years-and-counting pandemic, when people have taken to tech at an unprecedented pace, they\u2019re more aware of both the possibilities and the privacy challenges.They may have even heard about the shadowy world of data brokers who buy and sell information to actors they\u2019ve never heard of, for purposes that they can\u2019t see or control, in ways that may risk their privacy and security.And they may have a greater appreciation for the need for consistency across the country \u2014 not a patchwork of 50 different state laws, but a law that organizations and people can rely on as they go about their daily livesThere is a range of views when it comes to technology and technology regulation. But when it comes to national privacy regulation, there is a clear consensus: Americans want it.A Pew Research poll found that 75 percent of people support government regulation of consumer data.And the absence of a comprehensive federal privacy law has left a vacuum that states are trying to fill by scrambling to pass their own, often inconsistent, laws \u2014 a trend that actually risks fragmenting consumer protections.People are counting on all of us to address this issue \u2014 and fast. The good news is that after many years of discussion, today, there seems to be a growing consensus on this. We are starting to see interest from both parties, from many different constituencies. They are coming together on how to do this well.President Biden in his State of the Union address highlighted the importance of privacy, and there are growing reports that Congress is making progress toward comprehensive privacy legislation. We\u2019ve long supported that goal, and we welcome the forward movement.When data is misused, when consumers find their trust is misplaced, it hurts not just the whole digital ecosystem, but the potential for future innovation.And let me be clear: We at Google get it, and we\u2019ve rethought and adapted our own approaches to product development to promote privacy and security.For example, because digital services should keep your information for only as long as you find it helpful, we introduced auto-delete controls to let you easily delete your location history, web history, and YouTube history.Try to do that with any other business that holds data about you.We were the first platform to make it easy for people to download or transfer personal data when they want to switch to other services.And today, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world \u2014 because if it\u2019s not secure, it\u2019s not private.To set new standards for responsible data use, we\u2019ve also done what we do best \u2013 built new technological solutions, investing in privacy-preserving technologies.Privacy-preserving technologies don\u2019t just promote privacy by design, they achieve privacy through innovation. They help us minimize the collection of identifying data. They reduce the risk of data being misused \u2014 without undermining the tremendous value that people get from information services.As an example, at the start of COVID, we had an unprecedented partnership with Apple to develop Exposure Notifications, helping public health authorities supplement contact-tracing. Our North Star had to be designing a system with privacy protections baked in. So we worked with public health officials, privacy experts, regulators, used our most advanced technology to keep data safe, and established strict guidelines \u2013 all of which built public trust and adoption, saving thousands of lives.Now we\u2019ve got a complex business, and we haven\u2019t always gotten everything right, but we\u2019ve learned from those experiences, and we know what\u2019s possible when private industry and regulators work together.Of course it\u2019s not enough for some organizations to operate responsibly \u2014 we need a law that establishes consistent rules and reins in bad actors.So how do we do that? What\u2019s the best path forward?We're not focused on pie-in-the-sky proposals like creating an entirely new agency to regulate all the different uses of digital tools. We don\u2019t want snappy soundbites; we want sound solutions.The reality is that all companies are becoming digital companies, each with the potential to create new technologies and use information in new ways. We need consistent rules across the economy, and across the country.Instead of chasing theoretical approaches, we want to support the practical, real-world privacy work already being done by Congress.Current legislative privacy proposals like the ones put forward by Senators Cantwell and Wicker reflect important areas of agreement on the practical points that matter to people. And we hope they will work closely with Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers to move legislation through the committees expeditiously.We can build on the work that has already happened in this space, like proposals put forward by Senators Cortez Masto and Fischer and Representatives Stevens and Gonzalez to promote privacy-preserving technologies.With the right leadership from the White House and leadership in Congress, we can get this done \u2013 this year.So what are the sticking points? Issues like when and how consumers can file suit? The scope of FTC rulemaking? How federal and state laws will work together?Those issues are debated in some form nearly every time Congress passes new business regulations, including the sectoral privacy laws Congress has already passed. So, none of this is new or unresolvable. With the right working group and some reasonable compromises, these points can be reconciled.In fact, those conversations are already happening. Of course there has been no shortage of positions when it comes to privacy, ranging from ideas of notice and choice to proposals around new duties of care or loyalty.One possible finesse would be a responsible data approach that works in practice, across a growing digital economy.For example, we could start by giving consumers reasonable baseline assurances around transparency and control.And we could build on that, by requiring responsible data practices \u2014 like privacy reviews and data minimization \u2014 that could be easy to implement and promote shared processes for protecting people\u2019s data. Norms around good development processes could improve privacy practices for everyone.But the time to act is now.A U.S. privacy law would align us all on the privacy measures that people want and promote confidence in U.S. companies and our digital ecosystem.It would increase trust in U.S. leadership, as we promote cross-border data flows and compatible, pro-privacy, pro-innovation rules around the world.It would give everyone much-needed clarity and consistency so that organizations spend less time trying to navigate inconsistent rules and more time preventing harm and responsibly innovating \u2013 the kind of work that yields research breakthroughs and a stronger U.S. economy.There\u2019s no question that getting it done will take thoughtful compromises. Compromises by different groups in Congress. Compromises by advocates. And compromises by companies, including Google, who are used to doing business in certain ways. But that\u2019s what we need to get this done.Whatever final legislation comes out of the negotiations won\u2019t be perfect, and it won\u2019t address every concern. But we urge both businesses and advocates not to make the perfect the enemy of the good. Or of better, more consistent protections for all Americans.In closing, I\u2019ll say this: Google is an engineering company \u2014 and we look at problems from an engineering perspective. When we spot an issue with our services, we make fixing it a priority, and we often move engineers from other projects to help.This is that all-hands-on-deck moment for privacy.The vast majority of Americans want a federal privacy law. In fact, we\u2019ve never seen such broad-based, bipartisan consensus about the need for that law.It\u2019s a moment for Congress to come together, on a bipartisan basis, and deliver for the American people.Lawmakers and regulators face an important challenge, and an important opportunity. We pledge our support for that effort, and we hope that a broad cross-section of stakeholders will join together in support of their work.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

This agreement acknowledges that reality: it commits the parties to a high standard of data protection while establishing a reliable and durable foundation for the future of internet services on both sides of the Atlantic.\nA meaningful agreement\nThe work to get to this stage was anything but trivial, and required addressing important considerations of both national security and individual privacy. Google has long advocated reasonable limits on government surveillance. The U.S. government has now committed to systems that will enable independent and meaningful redress for people in the EU, strengthen the guardrails and proportionality of U.S. intelligence collection, and ensure effective oversight of these new privacy and civil liberties standards in ways that address the concerns articulated by the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nCitizens expect these safeguards from democratically elected governments, even as they understand the importance of protecting people from national security threats.\nBuilding for the long term\nPeople rely more than ever before on the global exchange of information in their daily lives. Everything from online shopping and travel to business operations and security depends on data flows across borders. The Framework guarantees that the tools and services people in the EU use every day will remain available, even while being held to the highest standards of privacy and data protection.\nWe look forward to certifying our processes under the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework at the first opportunity. For Google, these (and similar) standards serve as a floor, not a ceiling, for the protections we offer our users and customers. We already help our customers meet stringent data protection requirements by offering industry-leading technical controls, contractual commitments, and resources for risk assessment, and we have long offered leading data access and control tools to our users. Our investment in that work continues to grow.\nSustaining transatlantic cooperation\nThe Framework shows that it is possible to take difficult steps to reinforce transatlantic cooperation and address emerging security and information threats. This urgency should carry over to enacting a robust new U.S. federal privacy law to align with international standards and enhance trust and confidence in digital services.\nFor similar reasons, we called eight months ago for the creation of the Transatlantic Trade & Technology Council (TTC) to enable the kind of bilateral coordination necessary to get ahead of future challenges and ensure that the U.S. and EU avoid discordant or discriminatory approaches. We were encouraged by the creation of the TTC and its commitment to avoiding unnecessary barriers to technological trade. There is now a need for progress in other areas of transatlantic divergence, from online content to taxation to competition to supply chains.\nThe importance of safe, resilient distributed computing in the face of war and autocracy makes this work even more urgent. As the TTC prepares for its next meeting, it is more important than ever that it carry forward the lessons of the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework to promote a durable digital partnership.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

In 2007, we created a team of engineers dedicated to giving people an easy way to export a copy of their data from our products. Since then, we\u2019ve expanded our data portability offering with Google Takeout, which makes it easy to download data from over 70 Google products. Our teams continue to build cutting-edge technologies that help make this process simpler and keep personal data safe and secure as people transfer it between different platforms.\nToday, we are announcing new investments and continued collaboration with industry partners and experts to make data portability easier and more secure for every internet user.\nAdvancing data portability\nData portability can be challenging for people who don\u2019t have high-speed internet, unlimited mobile data plans, or who don\u2019t have a personal device with extra storage. In 2018, we launched the Data Transfer Project(DTP), an open source collaboration with Google, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Twitter and SmugMug to simplify data portability for people around the world.\nUnlike traditional methods of moving your files from one service to another, which require reliable broadband or drawing on mobile data plans, with DTP people can simply authorize a copy of the data to safely move to a new service without having to download it to a personal device first. This makes it easier for people to try new services without the burden of needing additional storage. And any company or organization can use DTP\u2019s open source code, meaning even smaller companies that don't have the engineering resources to build custom data portability solutions can take advantage of DTP\u2019s tools and give people an easy way to bring their data to a new service.\nToday, we\u2019re pledging to provide $3 million over the next five years, as well as hundreds of hours of our engineers\u2019 time, to help expand the open source libraries that facilitate more types of data transfer and allow more companies and organizations to participate in DTP.\nWe will also continue to improve our own tools, like Google Takeout, including adding new ways to move your files to different services with DTP technology. On average we see 8.2 million exports per month with Google Takeout, and in 2021, more than 400 billion files were exported, which has doubled since 2019.\nFinally, we will continue to support organizations and researchers working on portability and interoperability, and collaborate with them to develop industry-wide standards and guidance on this important issue.\nPolicy principles for portability\nRegulators around the world recognize that data portability is fundamental to promoting consumer choice and data protection. We agree \u2013 data portability is a secure way to foster innovation and competition among digital service providers. When people can easily switch to a new product or service, without the fear of losing access to their data, companies are encouraged to provide the best possible services to win over new users.\nWe believe data portability rules should follow three key principles:Put people first. Data portability supports competition by empowering consumers. Supporting standards for the most common data types will accelerate innovation in products that have a high value for consumers \u2014 including services for photos, playlists and contacts.Require exportability. Platforms that allow people to import their data should also allow them to export it. This encourages people to try new services without the risk that they will lose their data. Consumers will be more likely to try something new if they know they can change their mind.Prioritize privacy and security. Portability regulation must include safeguards against unauthorized access, diversion of data, and other types of fraud. This should include account authorization, encryption and delayed delivery.\nThese are the same principles we relied on to build Google Takeout and launch the DTP \u2013 and while we will continue to support regulatory efforts to create responsible data portability, we aren\u2019t waiting for legal mandates. We will continue to advance state-of-the-art data portability through our tools and our support for DTP.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Today, against the backdrop of an ongoing pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks, the stakes for these discussions feel particularly high \u2014 with many participants perceiving this as a time of heightened risk.\nGoogle\u2019s mission statement has always been to \u201corganize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d We provide tools that make people more informed, more connected, more productive \u2014 and more secure. That\u2019s why I\u2019m traveling to Munich this week and joining conversations about promoting and protecting the public square.\nFighting misinformation online and safeguarding elections\nIn the last few years, we\u2019ve seen a marked uptick in online disinformation campaigns, attempts to influence democratic elections, and cyber attacks on democracies' critical infrastructure.\nGoogle and YouTube have specialized teams of intelligence and security experts who work around the clock and around the world to thwart these threats and protect the people using our products. When it comes to the content we host on YouTube, our \u201c4R\u2019s\u201d approach includes not just Removing violative content and Reducing the spread of borderline content, but also Raising up authoritative content, and Rewarding trusted creators. And we continuously assess our approach and look at changes we can make to promote thoughtful engagement.\nDuring election cycles, we equip campaigns with best-in-class security features and protect their operations from attack. We work to help voters find high-quality, authoritative election information directly in our products. We employ teams who monitor elections from India to Europe to the United States. We use advanced technology to detect coordinated disinformation networks. And we work with partners like Defending Digital Campaigns and organizations in Europe to give political campaigns access to free Titan Security Keys \u2014 the strongest form of two-factor authentication \u2014 as well as the International Foundation for Electoral Systems to develop global security programming, protecting those who work to safeguard human rights.\nAdvancing cybersecurity and moving towards collective standards\nWhen it comes to cybersecurity, we have first-hand, real-world experience. Our systems stop attacks every single day, including attacks from sophisticated nation state actors. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. In the past, when our defenses weren\u2019t strong enough, we rebuilt our entire security infrastructure, sometimes inventing new technologies when state-of-the-art simply wouldn\u2019t do. We know that \u201chigh walls\u201d are not enough to stop bad actors, and we\u2019ve learned to use \u201cdefense in depth\u201d \u2014 creating access controls throughout our services and using multi-factor authentication as part of a zero-trust security approach, in which every node has to authenticate itself. As a result, today we keep more people safe online than any other company in the world.\nWe design our products to go beyond \u201csecurity by design\u201d to provide security by default. When that\u2019s not enough, we invent new ways to keep our users more secure.\nIn Munich, I will be urging policymakers to work together on establishing collective security standards including those that move democratic governments toward secure cloud services and zero-trust architecture.\nIn the last fifty years, democratic governments helped advance some of the world\u2019s most important innovations \u2014 including the Internet, microchips, computers, global positioning systems, and revolutionary vaccines against COVID. In the next fifty, I\u2019m optimistic about the ability of science and advanced technology to help solve some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges, like climate change, health care, and global development. To do that, we need to partner with governments and civil societies to rebuild trust and confidence in our institutions. Realizing the promise of tomorrow requires protecting the public square today.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

This includes building new digital advertising tools, in collaboration with the wider industry, to replace third-party cookies with alternatives that better protect consumer privacy and preserve peoples\u2019 access to free content online.Since announcing the Privacy Sandbox we have been in open dialogue with the industry, consumer advocates and regulators to gather feedback on this initiative. Over the past year, we have also worked closely with the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) and Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO), including on a set of legally-binding commitments to address the CMA\u2019s competition concerns over the Privacy Sandbox which will govern how we will design and implement this initiative. The aim, through this regulatory oversight and supervision, is to provide reassurance that the Privacy Sandbox will protect consumers and support a competitive ad-funded web, and not favor Google.The commitments address these concerns through three main principles. First, the changes we will make in Chrome in the context of the Privacy Sandbox initiative will apply in the same way to Google\u2019s advertising products as to products from other companies. Second, we will design, develop and implement Privacy Sandbox with regulatory oversight and input from the CMA and the ICO. And third, we will inform the CMA in advance of our intention to remove third-party cookies and agree to wait for their feedback on whether any competition law concerns remain.Privacy by design and by default have been at the heart of the Privacy Sandbox from the outset, and we are also intent on ensuring that the new tools meet the requirements set out in the recent ICO\u2019s Opinion on Data protection and privacy expectations for online advertising proposals. To that end, we are designing these new tools to avoid cross-site tracking, provide people with better transparency and control, and result in better outcomes for people and businesses on the web. We look forward to further engagement with data protection authorities as we continue to iterate and improve on the proposals.We\u2019re pleased that today the CMA has accepted these commitments, which now go into immediate effect. The development and implementation criteria that underpin these commitments are summarized below, and can be found in full on the CMA\u2019s website. We will apply the commitments globally because we believe that they provide a roadmap for how to address both privacy and competition concerns in this evolving sector.Respecting user privacy while maintaining a well functioning ad-funded webGoogle\u2019s objectives in developing the Privacy Sandbox proposals are to make the web more private and secure for people, while:Supporting the ability of publishers to generate revenue from advertising inventory and the ability of advertisers to secure value for money from advertising spend;Supporting a good user experience when navigating the web, including in relation to digital advertising;Providing users with substantial transparency and control in relation to their data as they browse the web; andNot distorting competition between Google\u2019s own advertising products and services and those of other market participants.We recognize that many publishers and advertisers rely on online advertising to fund their websites and reach new customers. So building tools which aim to improve people\u2019s privacy, while continuing to support advertising, is key to keeping the web open and accessible to everyone and allowing businesses of all sizes to succeed.Developing the Privacy SandboxTo achieve the objectives above, Google is committing to designing, developing and implementing the Privacy Sandbox proposals taking into account specific criteria agreed with the CMA:The impact on privacy outcomes and compliance with privacy laws;The impact on competition in digital advertising between Google and other market participants, and, in particular, the risk of distortion to competition;The impact on publishers (including their ability to generate revenue from ad inventory) and advertisers;The impact on user experience (e.g. relevance of advertising and transparency over the use of personal data); andThe technical feasibility, complexity and cost involved for Google.Building on many months of open consultation by Google \u2014 and the CMA \u2014 with the wider industry, Google will be consulting with the CMA and ICO on a regular basis in relation to the design, development and implementation of the Privacy Sandbox (including testing and public announcements). Google will also increase its engagement with industry stakeholders (including publishers, advertisers and ad tech providers) by providing a systematic feedback process to take on board reasonable views and suggestions. This continues our previous engagement with web community members, who are encouraged to participate in the development and testing of the proposed new technologies through public discussion forums like the W3C, developer channels such as GitHub, industry groups and origin trials. We will also establish a dedicated microsite, available from privacysandbox.com, explaining these channels in more detail and offering a new feedback form to submit suggested use cases and API feature requests, by the end of February 2022.Ensuring complianceGoogle will work with the CMA to resolve concerns without delay and consult and update the CMA and the ICO on an ongoing basis. Google has also committed to appoint an independent Monitoring Trustee who will have the access and technical expertise needed to ensure compliance, having consulted with the CMA. The Monitoring Trustee will work directly with the CMA, and will be central in ensuring compliance with the data and non-discrimination commitments offered by Google.We believe that these commitments will ensure that competition continues to thrive while providing flexibility in designing the Privacy Sandbox APIs in a way that will improve peoples\u2019 privacy online. Helping businesses adapt to a privacy-safe web, through invention and collaboration, can help provide the foundation for long-term economic sustainability and growth.This process requires close engagement with competition and privacy regulators and new ways of working together. We hope these commitments can contribute to that new framework.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nUK\n  \nChrome\n  \nGoogle Ads\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

These suits mischaracterize and inaccurately describe the settings and controls we provide users over location data.\nToday, a court in Arizona made a significant legal ruling against the Arizona Attorney General. The AG is somehow claiming this as a big victory but in reality, a judge rejected his central argument. Unfortunately, just before today\u2019s decision, four other state attorneys general rushed to file similar lawsuits making similarly inaccurate and outdated claims.\nWe wanted to take this opportunity to set the record straight about the location settings we offer, and how you are in control of your location data.\nAll smartphones use location data \u2014 it\u2019s integral to how they work. It\u2019s collected and used by network operators, device makers, apps, websites and operating systems. For our part, location makes Google products work better for you \u2014 it\u2019s what helps you navigate around a traffic jam, helps you find your phone when you\u2019ve misplaced it, and lets you find a pizza shop in your neighborhood instead of suggesting one in a different state.\nWe recognize that you have a lot of decisions to make around the use of location data by various apps and services. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve worked hard over the past few years to build more control and transparency directly into our products to make location easy to understand and simple to manage:Easy-to-use settings: We offer settings like Location History, which creates a timeline of where you have been, saved to your Google Account. You can delete this data or pause saving it at any time. Web & App Activity saves activity like the things you do on Google sites and apps, including associated info like location. Again, you can delete this data or pause saving it at any time.Auto-delete by default: Two years ago, we updated our data retention practices \u2014 in addition to turning Location History and Web & App Activity off, you can choose to automatically auto-delete them after a set period of time (3 months, 18 months or 36 months). (For new users, the default is to auto-delete them after 18 months).Transparency: You can instantly see your settings and manage them right from your favorite Google products \u2014 for example, on every search results page, we indicate the location information that was used to deliver results, and enable you to change your settings directly. And if you have Location History enabled, we send monthly and annual emails to remind you about places you\u2019ve visited, along with easy access to your settings.Maps Incognito mode: With Google Maps Incognito mode, the places you search for or navigate to in Google Maps won\u2019t be saved to your Google Account.Advertisers and apps: Location data helps you get relevant offers such as local pizza restaurants but we never sell your location data to advertisers \u2014 or to anyone. And from Android 10 onwards, you can choose to share your device\u2019s location with third party apps only while they\u2019re in use \u2014 or not at all.\nAs we design our products, we focus on three important principles: keeping your information safe, treating it responsibly, and putting you in control. We aim to strike a balance between offering granular customization for users who want to pick and choose between options, while keeping our controls simple and easy to understand. We will continue to focus on providing simple, easy-to-understand privacy settings to our users, and will not be distracted from this work by meritless lawsuits that mischaracterize our efforts.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSafety & Security\n  "}

With each version, AG Paxton follows the same pattern: make inaccurate and inflammatory allegations, publicize them widely, and repeat. This playbook may generate attention, but it doesn\u2019t make for a credible antitrust lawsuit.\nAG Paxton's allegations are more heat than light, and we don't believe they meet the legal standard to send this case to trial. The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims.\nWhy this lawsuit misses the law and the facts\nAt its heart, AG Paxton is asking the court to force us to share user data and design our products in a way that helps our competitors rather than our customers or consumers. But American antitrust law doesn\u2019t require companies to give information to, or design products specifically for, rivals. This lawsuit fails to acknowledge that ad tech is a highly dynamic industry with countless competitors. It\u2019s been recognized that competition in ad tech has led to reduced fees, encouraged new entry, led to increased investment and expanded options for advertisers and publishers alike.\nCorrecting AG Paxton\u2019s false and misleading allegations\nAG Paxton overlooks, or misstates, a litany of clear facts. We want to publicly and unequivocally refute the more egregious allegations:We don\u2019t force \u201ctying\u201d: A central allegation in AG Paxton\u2019s lawsuit is that publishers are forced to use our ad server in order to access our ad exchange. This allegation is simply wrong, and AG Paxton offers no evidence to prove otherwise. If a publisher wants to use our ad exchange with a different ad server, they are free to do so.Header bidding is thriving: A core claim is that we prevented rivals from using a technology, header bidding, through our Open Bidding program. But again, the facts don\u2019t support that. Since we launched Open Bidding, header bidding\u2019s popularity has continued to grow. Recent surveys show a vast majority of publishers currently use header bidding. We simply haven\u2019t held header bidding back.Our auctions are fair: The complaint uses deliberately inflammatory rhetoric to accuse us of a litany of wrongdoings: \u201cmisleading\u201d publishers, \u201crigging\u201d auctions through special data access, running \u201cthird price auctions,\u201d \u201cpocketing the difference.\u201d But quite simply, we have \u2013 provably \u2013 done none of these things. AG Paxton is distorting various optimizations that we have created to improve publisher yields and returns for advertisers. To be clear, contrary to his claims, these optimizations did not and do not result in Google \u201cpocketing\u201d additional revenue share and do not make auctions unfair. And our auction was always a second price auction (until 2019 when it became a first price auction).Out-of-date claims: And more broadly, much of AG Paxton's lawsuit is based on out-dated information that bears no correlation to our current products or business in this dynamic industry (and in any event never amounted to a violation of antitrust laws).\nFacebook Audience Network\u2019s participation in Open Bidding\nThe allegation that has generated the most attention is that we somehow \u201ccolluded\u201d with Facebook Audience Network (FAN) through our Open Bidding agreement. That\u2019s simply not true.\nTo set the record straight, we are today including the full text of our agreement with FAN in our motion to the court. Here are some facts that contradict AG Paxton's claims:This is far from a secret deal: We announced FAN\u2019s participation as one of over 25 partners in our Open Bidding program, all of whom have signed their own agreements to participate.This is a procompetitive agreement: FAN\u2019s participation benefits advertisers because it gives them additional ways to reach their desired audiences. And it benefits publishers because it introduces additional bidders to compete for their ad space, earning them higher returns. In fact, if FAN weren\u2019t a part of Open Bidding, AG Paxton may have claimed we were preventing a rival from accessing our products and depriving publishers of additional revenue.FAN\u2019s involvement is not exclusive: The agreement doesn\u2019t prevent FAN from participating in header bidding or other competing auctions. In fact, FAN participates in several similar auctions on rival platforms. The agreement also doesn\u2019t prevent FAN from building a competing product. Our agreement explicitly states that FAN\u2019s participation is not exclusive (and nowhere in our agreement is header bidding even mentioned). And the entire Open Bidding program (of which Facebook is one of 25 participants) accounts for a small fraction of the display ads we place.We do not manipulate the auction: Finally, this agreement does not provide FAN with an advantage in the Open Bidding auction. FAN competes in the auction just like other bidders: FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression, period. If another eligible network or exchange bids higher, they win the auction. We don\u2019t allocate ad space to FAN, they don\u2019t receive speed advantages, and we don\u2019t guarantee that they win any auctions.\nOur advertising technology helps fund digital content that benefits everyone, and it supports thousands of businesses, from small advertisers to major publishers. Our work in this space is designed to balance and support the needs of publishers, advertisers and consumers.\nWe\u2019re confident that this case is wrong on the facts and the law, and should be dismissed. However, if it does move forward, we\u2019ll continue to vigorously defend ourselves.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Below is our statement from Kent Walker:These changes concede every concern that has been raised about the bill \u2014 and solve none of them. For example, the amendment acknowledges the real security flaws in the bill by saying that platforms won\u2019t be forced to share user data with companies on the U.S. sanctions list. But it says nothing about provisions that could require sharing data with countless other bad actors and foreign companies. The bill still covers leading American companies, while giving a free pass to foreign companies. It still includes all the provisions that hamper our ability to offer security by default on our platforms, exposing people to phishing attacks, malware and spammy content. And it still includes the provisions that could prevent us from providing consumers and businesses useful, free services. In fact, the amendment seems to punish free services in favor of services consumers have to pay for, as it seems to exempt \"fee for subscription services\" (like Microsoft\u2019s subscription-based software). This raises its own set of troubling issues, would hurt consumers who benefit from free services, and doesn\u2019t address the bill\u2019s real problems.\nEvery day, millions of Americans use online services like Google Search, Maps and Gmail to find new information and get things done. Research shows these free services provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American, and polls show that 90% of Americans like our products and services.\nHowever, legislation being debated in the House and Senate could break these and other popular online services, making them less helpful and less secure, and damaging American competitiveness. We\u2019re deeply concerned about these unintended consequences.\nAntitrust law is about ensuring that companies are competing hard to build their best products for consumers. But the vague and sweeping provisions of these bills would break popular products that help consumers and small businesses, only to benefit a handful of companies who brought their pleas to Washington.\nSome specifics:\nHarming U.S. technological leadership\nThese bills would impose one set of rules on American companies while giving a pass to foreign companies. And they would give the Federal Trade Commission and other government agencies unprecedented power over the design of consumer products. All of this would be a dramatic reversal of the approach that has made the U.S. a global technology leader, and risks ceding America\u2019s technology leadership and threatening our national security, as bipartisan national security experts have warned:Americans might get worse, less relevant, and less helpful versions of products like Google Search and Maps (see below for some examples).An \u201cinnovation by permission\u201d requirement could force American technology companies to get approval from government bureaucrats before launching new features or even fixing problems, while foreign companies would be free to innovate. Foreign companies could also routinely access American technology as well as Americans' data.Handicapping America\u2019s technology leaders would threaten our leading sources of research and development spending \u2014 just as bipartisan voices in Congress are recognizing the need to increase American R&D investment to stay competitive in the global race for AI, quantum, and other advanced technologies.That\u2019s why national security experts from both parties have aligned in warning that current anti-tech bills could threaten America\u2019s national security.\nDegrading security and privacy\nGoogle is able to protect billions of people around the world from cyberattacks because we bake security and privacy protections into our services. Every day, Gmail automatically blocks more than 100 million phishing attempts and Google Play Protect runs security scans on 100 billion installed apps around the world.\nThese bills could prevent us from securing our products by default, and would introduce new privacy risks for you. For instance:The bills could hamper our ability to integrate automated security features if other companies offer similar features. For example, we might be prevented from automatically including our SafeBrowsing service and spam filters in Chrome and Gmail to block pop-ups, viruses, scams and malware.Breaking apart the connections between Google tools could limit our ability to detect and protect you against security risks that use security signals across our products.These bills may compel us to share the sensitive data you store with us with unknown companies in ways that could compromise your privacy.And when you use Google Search or Google Play, we might have to give equal prominence to a raft of spammy and low-quality services.\nBreaking features that help consumers and small businesses\nWhen you come to Google Search, you want to get the most helpful results. But these bills could prohibit us from giving you integrated, high-quality results \u2014 even when you prefer them \u2014 just because some other company might offer competing answers. In short, we\u2019d have to prefer results that help competitors even if they don\u2019t help you.If you search for a place or an address, we may not be able to show you directions from Google Maps in your results. As just one example, if you search for \u201cvaccine near me,\u201d we might not be able to show you a map of vaccine locations in your community.When you have an urgent question \u2014 like \u201cstroke symptoms\u201d \u2014 Google Search could be barred from giving you immediate and clear information, and instead be required to direct you to a mix of low quality results.When you search for local businesses, Google Search and Maps may be prohibited from highlighting information we gather about hours of operation, contact information, and reviews. That could hurt small businesses and local retailers, as well as their customers.The bills would also harm small businesses if tools like Gmail, Calendar and Docs were not allowed to be integrated or work together seamlessly.\nA boost for competitors, not consumers\nWhile these bills might help the companies campaigning for them, including some of our major competitors, that would come at a cost to consumers and small businesses. Moreover, the bills wouldn\u2019t curb practices by our competitors that actually harm consumers and customers (they seem to be intentionally gerrymandered to exclude many other major companies). For example, they don\u2019t address the problem of companies forcing governments and small businesses to pay higher prices for enterprise software. And of course, the online services targeted by these bills have reduced prices; these bills say nothing about sectors where prices have actually been rising and contributing to inflation.\nThe wrong focus\nThere are important discussions taking place about the rules of the road for the modern economy. We believe that updating technology regulations in areas like privacy, AI, and protections for kids and families could provide real benefits. But breaking our products wouldn\u2019t address any of these issues. Instead, it would eliminate helpful features, expose people to new privacy and security risks, and weaken America\u2019s technological leadership. There\u2019s a better way. Congress shouldn\u2019t rush to judgment, and should instead take more time to consider the unintended consequences of these bills.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

The recent log4j open source software vulnerability shows that we need the same attention and commitment to safeguarding open source tools, which are just as critical.Open source software code is available to the public, free for anyone to use, modify, or inspect. Because it is freely available, open source facilitates collaborative innovation and the development of new technologies to help solve shared problems. That\u2019s why many aspects of critical infrastructure and national security systems incorporate it. But there\u2019s no official resource allocation and few formal requirements or standards for maintaining the security of that critical code. In fact, most of the work to maintain and enhance the security of open source, including fixing known vulnerabilities, is done on an ad hoc, volunteer basis.For too long, the software community has taken comfort in the assumption that open source software is generally secure due to its transparency and the assumption that \u201cmany eyes\u201d were watching to detect and resolve problems. But in fact, while some projects do have many eyes on them, others have few or none at all.At Google, we\u2019ve been working to raise awareness of the state of open source security. We\u2019ve invested millions in developing frameworks and new protective tools. We\u2019ve also contributed financial resources to groups and individuals working on securing foundational open source projects like Linux. Just last year, as part of our $10 billion commitment to advancing cybersecurity, we pledged to expand the application of our Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA or \u201cSalsa\u201d) framework to protect key open source components. That includes $100 million to support independent organizations, like the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), that manage open source security priorities and help fix vulnerabilities.But we know more work is needed across the ecosystem to create new models for maintaining and securing open source software. During today\u2019s meeting, we shared a series of proposals for how to do this:\nIdentifying critical projectsWe need a public-private partnership to identify a list of critical open source projects \u2014 with criticality determined based on the influence and importance of a project \u2014 to help prioritize and allocate resources for the most essential security assessments and improvements.Longer term, we need new ways of identifying software that might pose a systemic risk \u2014 based on how it will be integrated into critical projects \u2014 so that we can anticipate the level of security required and provide appropriate resourcing.\nEstablishing security, maintenance & testing baselinesGrowing reliance on open source means that it\u2019s time for industry and government to come together to establish baseline standards for security, maintenance, provenance, and testing \u2014 to ensure national infrastructure and other important systems can rely on open source projects. These standards should be developed through a collaborative process, with an emphasis on frequent updates, continuous testing, and verified integrity.Fortunately, the software community is off to a running start. Organizations like the OpenSSF are already working across industry to create these standards (including supporting efforts like our SLSA framework).\nIncreasing public and private supportMany leading companies and organizations don\u2019t recognize how many parts of their critical infrastructure depend on open source. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential that we see more public and private investment in keeping that ecosystem healthy and secure. In the discussion today, we proposed setting up an organization to serve as a marketplace for open source maintenance, matching volunteers from companies with the critical projects that most need support. Google stands ready to contribute resources to this effort.\nGiven the importance of digital infrastructure in our lives, it\u2019s time to start thinking of it in the same way we do our physical infrastructure. Open source software is a connective tissue for much of the online world \u2014 it deserves the same focus and funding we give to our roads and bridges. Today\u2019s meeting at the White House was both a recognition of the challenge and an important first step towards addressing it. We applaud the efforts of the National Security Council, the Office of the National Cyber Director, and DHS CISA in leading a concerted response to cybersecurity challenges and we look forward to continuing to do our part to support that work.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

We have been following these discussions closely and agree that policies in this space should be guided by foundational principles that spur innovation, maintain security and expand user choice across the ecosystem, whether on mobile, desktop or gaming consoles.It\u2019s our belief that operating systems and app stores should:Let consumers download apps and games from anywhere \u2014 operating systems should support multiple app stores and allow consumers to get apps and games directly from developers.Keep consumers safe by building protections into the core operating system and requiring app stores and developers to follow high safety standards.Avoid using non-public data about developers to build competing products and services.Be upfront with developers about the rules of the road, enforce policies in a predictable way, work with developers to address problems and offer clear means of appeal and redress when issues arise.Permit developers to build direct customer relationships, with reasonable safeguards to protect consumer safety.These principles have roots in our work in the early days of mobile, when we made an unprecedented bet that a free, open-source operating system like Android, built with safety and choice at its core, would be good for developers and consumers and could support the growth of the entire smartphone ecosystem. At the time, there were many different business model options to support a platform \u2014 some charged licensing fees for their operating system, others sold high-margin hardware devices. We chose to do things differently by making our operating system and app store free, with minimal restrictions.We also believe that operating systems and app stores should have a business model that enables both platforms and developers to succeed financially. Just as it costs money to build an app, it costs money to build a platform, and a platform\u2019s business model should align its success with developers\u2019 success.Over the years we\u2019ve made a significant investment in Android and Google Play, and like any business, we need a business model that lets us keep investing in our mobile efforts. Today, Android is used on tens of thousands of device models from smartphone companies around the world and more than two million developers use Google Play to reach more than 2.5 billion users in 190 countries.We\u2019ve been able to sustain Android and Google Play through a fee paid by developers who sell in-app digital content, which is a common model across technology platforms. Ninety-seven percent of developers globally don\u2019t sell digital content and are not subject to a service fee. For developers who do sell digital content, we recognize that one size doesn't fit all, and we\u2019ve evolved our business based on feedback from our developer ecosystem. We've tailored our fee structure with a number of programs to meet different businesses' needs. With the new programs we announced this year, 99% of developers globally qualify for a service fee of 15% or less, and developers have welcomed these changes.App and game platforms need to balance consumers\u2019 expectations of choice and safety, developers\u2019 desire to innovate and grow, and their own need for a viable business model. We look forward to contributing to the public policy conversation, guided by our steadfast commitment to building thriving, open platforms that empower consumers and help developers succeed.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle Play\n  "}

Multilateralism, born of the 20th century\u2019s conflicts, is just as relevant in a world of 21st-century threats. That\u2019s particularly true for one of the most pressing multi-stakeholder challenges today: cybersecurity.\nThe internet itself is a multi-stakeholder system, and protecting citizens online requires cooperation among governments and businesses. For example, this week\u2019s crackdown on ransomware operators by Europol and the U.S. Department of Justice, resulting in the arrests of two REvil operators, capped off an enforcement effort that spanned a year and as many as 17 nations. These actions, coming just ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Budapest Convention, highlight the value of cross-border cooperation in fighting cybercrime, as well as the importance of protecting individuals and their rights online.\nLikewise, we applaud the news, announced by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in Paris, that the United States is expanding its efforts to advance international cooperation in cybersecurity, by joining the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace \u2014 a voluntary commitment to work with the international community to advance cybersecurity and preserve the open, interoperable, secure, and reliable Internet.\nGoogle was among the first signatories to the Paris Call in 2018 when it was initially advanced by the government of President Macron of France. The Paris Call\u2019s 9 principles are something we should all agree to, but it is past time to put them into action. Google has unique expertise supporting many of these principles. To name a few:\nDefend electoral processes. Through our Advanced Protection Program (APP), we partner with organizations around the world to protect elected officials, campaign offices, and other high-risk users such as human rights workers and journalists. During the 2020 United States elections, APP was the go-to choice for 140 federal campaigns. Since the launch of APP, there have been zero identified instances of a successful targeted attack on an APP user.Lifecycle Security. The Solarwinds attack underscored the real risks and ramifications of supply chain attacks. To improve our own security and support the broader community, we worked with the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) to develop and release Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA or \u201csalsa\u201d), a proven framework for securing the software supply chain. We also pledged to provide $100 million to support third-party foundations, like OpenSSF, that manage open source security priorities and help fix vulnerabilities.Cyber Hygiene. Advancing cyber hygiene is a simple way to reduce the majority of successful attacks. At our Google Safety Engineering Center (GSEC) in Munich and at Google security engineering hubs around the world, we are making it easier for our users to stay safe. For example, Google has been at the forefront of innovation in two-step verification (2SV) for years. And because we know the best way to keep our users safe is to turn on our security protections by default, we have started to automatically configure our users\u2019 accounts into a more secure state. By the end of 2021, we plan to auto-enroll an additional 150 million Google users in 2SV and require 2 million YouTube creators to turn it on.\nWe have learned in the wake of SolarWinds, Hafnium, and other attacks is that companies need to contribute more of their technology and expertise to solving these challenges. In that vein, we are doubling down to develop solutions to protect users, organizations, and society. Earlier this year, we announced that we will invest $10 billion over the next five years to advance cybersecurity, including expanding access to zero-trust security tools and offering free security skills training programs for workers in the U.S. and Europe.\nGoogle keeps more people safe online than anyone else by putting security at the core of everything we do. We are committed to advancing community-driven, multi-stakeholder approaches to cybersecurity. We look forward to expanding our work with governments and the private sector to develop security technologies and standards that make us all safer.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

We\u2019re not only committed to be more sustainable in how Google operates as a business, but we\u2019re also focused on building new technologies to make sure that partners, enterprise customers and the billions of people who use Google products every day can be more sustainable as well.How we\u2019re leading at GoogleAt Google, our goal is to achieve net zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We aim to reduce the majority of our emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.We were the first major company to operate as carbon neutral in 2007, and have matched our energy use with 100 percent renewable energy for four years in a row. Last year we set a moonshot goal to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030 for all of our data centers and campuses. That means that by the end of the decade, we aim to deliver every search, every email, and every YouTube video without emitting carbon. We\u2019re making strong progress \u2014 in 2020 we achieved 67% carbon-free energy on an hourly basis across our data centers, up from 61% in 2019. Five of our data centers, including those in Denmark and Finland, are at or near 90% carbon-free energy. On our campuses we\u2019re investing in sustainable energy innovations, like dragonscale solar and geothermal pilings, to get us closer to our goal to be carbon-free by 2030. We hope these new technologies will inspire similar projects from others that advance sustainability without compromising design and aesthetics.How we\u2019re enabling our partnersUrban areas are currently responsible for 70% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions. Last year we pledged to help more than 500 cities reduce one gigaton of carbon emissions per year by 2030 via Google\u2019s Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE). EIE is helping major cities, including Amsterdam, Birmingham UK and Copenhagen, map their emissions data, solar potential, and air quality for their remediation plans.Technology can also help cities decarbonize in more direct ways. We recently shared an early research project that is deploying AI to help cities make their traffic lights more efficient, and we have a pilot program in Israel accomplishing this. So far, we have seen a 10-20% reduction in fuel consumption and delay time at intersections. We\u2019re excited to expand this pilot to Rio de Janeiro and beyond.Finally, we\u2019re helping business customers like Whirlpool, Etsy, HSBC, Unilever and Salesforce develop solutions for the specific climate change challenges they face. Unilever is working with the power of Google Cloud and satellite imagery through Google Earth Engine to help avoid deforestation in their supply chain. At Cloud Next, we launched Carbon Footprint, a tool that helps large and small businesses understand their gross carbon emissions associated with the electricity of their Google Cloud Platform usage. This new information will help companies track progress toward their own climate targets.How we\u2019re aiming to empower everyoneIn addition to businesses, increasingly individuals are focused on what more they can do to help the planet. That\u2019s why we committed to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices by 2022 through Google\u2019s products and services. Recently, we shared several new ways people can use Google\u2019s products to make sustainable choices \u2014 from choosing eco-friendly routes and searching for greener flights, hotels, and appliances to supporting clean energy from home with Nest and surfacing authoritative information on climate change from sources like the United Nations.Google\u2019s goal is to make the sustainable choice an easier choice \u2014 for governments, businesses, and individuals. We look forward to a carbon-free future and are excited to continue the conversation at COP26.\nPOSTED IN:\nSustainability\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Because we value access to information, we work to minimize over-reaching removals whenever possible by seeking to narrow the scope of government demands and ensure that they are authorized by relevant laws.\nFor over a decade, we\u2019ve also published a transparency report on Government Requests for Content Removal. This report includes only demands made by governments and courts. We report separately on requests by private actors under content-removal systems established by various governments such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States or the Right to be Forgotten included in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.\nOver the years, as use of our services has grown, our transparency report shows a rise in the number of government demands for content removal \u2013 as to both the volume of requests that we receive and the number of individual items of content we are asked to remove. Today\u2019s transparency report, covering January to June 2021, represents the highest volumes we\u2019ve seen on both measures to date.\nJanuary - June 2021 Data\nTop countries by volume of requests:RussiaIndiaSouth KoreaTurkeyPakistanBrazilUnited StatesAustraliaVietnamIndonesiaTop countries by volume of items:IndonesiaRussiaKazakhstanPakistanSouth KoreaIndiaVietnamUnited StatesTurkeyBrazil\nSee the full report here.\nAs research by organizations like Freedom House makes clear, all online platforms are seeing a similar trend.\nWe\u2019re also seeing a significant increase in the number of laws that require information to be removed from online services. These laws vary by country and region, and require the removal of content on a very wide range of issues \u2013 from hate speech to adult content and obscenity, to medical misinformation, to privacy and intellectual property violations.\nMany of these laws seek to protect people online and align with Google's own platform policies and community guidelines that help ensure people have a good experience while they are using our services. But laws in some countries can also go significantly beyond those policies, affecting access to information on a range of topics.\nCoupled with this, we\u2019ve also seen new laws that impose individual liability on local employees for actions taken by a company offering online services. These types of laws have drawn concern from organizations like the Global Network Initiative because individuals can be pressured, prosecuted, and held personally liable, even when they are not responsible for the content decisions of the company they work for.\nWhile content removal and local representative laws are often associated with repressive regimes, they are increasingly not limited to such nations. Findings from entities like the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), our own transparency report data, and any survey of international laws introduced over the past few years all point to the fact that we are likely to continue to see a rise in these types of laws across more countries around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

In fact, we\u2019ve encouraged the U.S. government to adopt a 24/7 carbon-free energy goal for federal facilities and helped launch a 24/7 Carbon-free Energy Compact with SE4ALL and UN Energy.But for us and other companies to realize this future, we need to galvanize investment and modernization of our energy infrastructure. It\u2019s for this reason that we have supported strong climate policies like clean energy standards and renewable energy tax incentives, which have helped enable clean electricity generation to grow dramatically in dozens of states.And it\u2019s why we support the clean energy and climate provisions in the bipartisan infrastructure and budget reconciliation packages. These provisions provide the funding and supportive regulatory climate to promote important investments in clean energy that help the U.S. move toward a cleaner and greener energy system, putting the vision of carbon-free operations within reach.This is a pivotal moment. Strong, comprehensive climate and clean energy policy can help lead the way to 24/7 carbon-free grids and to the transition to a 1.5\u00b0C world. The moment is now.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSustainability\n  "}

As I recently wrote, we strongly support the goals of the Council and believe closer cooperation on digital, trade and economic policy will help achieve shared goals \u2013 overcoming the pandemic, achieving an equitable economic recovery, promoting the responsible use of technology, and advancing democratic norms.\nThe TTC has a wide-ranging agenda, with ten working groups covering a broad array of topics. While it is encouraging that both sides have agreed that all issues should be on the table, the long-term success of the forum will depend on the parties focusing and making progress on the most critical ones. To that end, here are a few that we think merit serious attention:\nTransatlantic regulatory principles: The digital economy and the millions of jobs it supports on both sides of the Atlantic require meaningful consultation between EU and US decision makers based on shared regulatory principles. While policymakers on both sides are rightly debating new rules around technology in areas like AI, it is essential that these and other new policies governing digital markets and services are interoperable and focused on helping and protecting consumers \u2013 adhering to principles of consistent treatment, robust due process protections, and safeguards for user privacy and intellectual property.Secure transatlantic cyberspace: Internet infrastructure on both sides of the Atlantic and globally is increasingly under threat as cyberattacks continue to exploit vulnerabilities targeting people, organizations, and governments. Greater coordination between European and US cybersecurity work, including building shared standards, is critical to enhanced effectiveness. We\u2019re committed to supporting this initiative, including by partnering with government, industry and academia, and we recently pledged to invest $10 billion over the next five years to strengthen cybersecurity around the world.Legal certainty on data flows: In the digital world, where every email and video conference involves the transfer of data, businesses on both sides of the Atlantic need legal certainty that such data flows can continue, subject to agreed protection of consumer privacy. The EU and US urgently need a reliable, long-term agreement on transatlantic data flows. Resolving this issue with a new Privacy Shield will enable Europe and the US to drive trust with allies and globally.\u00a0\u00a0Responsible use of technology: Artificial intelligence and emerging technologies are increasingly critical to the transatlantic economy and to tackling common challenges like climate change. During the pandemic, AI has been used to boost knowledge sharing, enable better prediction of health trends, and support research to develop vaccines and treatments for serious disease. But these same technologies also present new challenges and risks, as well as potential regulatory conflicts. Under the TTC, the EU and US have an opportunity to establish a common approach to AI policy and research that enables responsible AI innovation and adoption around the world. The business community has an important role to play here, which is why we created a set of AI principles that govern our responsible development of this technology and are sharing our progress in implementation.Trade and technology for everyone: All too often, small businesses and workers have been an afterthought when it comes to the international trading system and the technology agenda. A smart approach to trade policy and innovation can bring them back in \u2013\u00a0and create new opportunities for workers and small businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The EU and the US should identify access barriers, find new ways to ensure that workers get digital skills, and put digital tools and exporting technologies in the hands of small businesses. At Google, we have launched an updated version of our Market Finder tool, which enables small businesses to sell their goods and services to international markets. And we\u2019re partnering with a range of actors \u2013 whether through the European Commission\u2019s Pact for Skills or directly with community colleges, non-profits, and workforce boards \u2013 to make our job training programs more accessible. So far, these programs have helped over 100,000 people on each side of the Atlantic to secure new jobs.An open internet that respects international human rights: We continue to believe that an open internet \u2013 one that respects human rights \u2013 benefits everyone. But the open internet is increasingly under threat. According to Freedom House, governments suspended internet access in over 20 countries in 2021 and dozens of countries pursued content rules that would impact freedom of expression. We need democracies \u2013 led by Europe and the US \u2013 to continue to stand up for internet freedom and human rights in the online space. We are committed to working with governments, multilateral and multi-stakeholder organizations, and other technology companies to advance those values.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe historic partnership between Europe and the US faces some profound challenges, but, as in the past, we have always found opportunities to build and strengthen our partnership based on shared values and common principles. The launch of the TTC is proof that our shared values are stronger than any individual difference of opinion. We applaud this initiative and stand ready to contribute to its success.\u00a0\u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

In countries like Kenya, India, and Brazil, COVID drove up unemployment, disrupted supply chains, and devastated entire sectors. \nIf we do nothing, it could take years for these countries to recover, creating even greater divides between people in developed and emerging economies. But we\u2019re seeing a contrary trend that could dramatically turn things around. Looking beyond the short-term headlines to longer-term trends actually tells a different story.\nAs last year\u2019s Digital Sprinters Framework outlined, if emerging economies adopt the right digital policies, they could actually emerge stronger and better prepared to accelerate economic growth and opportunity. \n10:25\nWhile COVID has accelerated use of technology to learn and conduct business, almost half of all households in the developing world still lack access to broadband and high-speed internet. Greater digital adoption could help emerging economies\u00a0generate as much as $3.4 trillion of economic value by 2030. That amount of growth would mean an astonishing 25 percent increase in GDP in Brazil, a 31 percent increase in Saudi Arabia and a 33 percent increase in Nigeria. \nUnlocking this growth will require focused initiatives. Governments in emerging markets want to know where to invest limited resources, and how to support and grow their national talent pool.\u00a0 That\u2019s why, building on the Digital Sprinters framework, Google commissioned the Portulans Institute to develop a \u201cFuture Readiness Economic Index\u201d \u2014 a ranking of digital progress, and a roadmap for the future.\nThe Future Readiness Economic Index\nThe Future Readiness Economic Index gives governments, businesses and analysts comprehensive metrics and milestones to assess their digital transformation.\nAssessing countrywide trends can be an inexact science. But by breaking down the data in critical areas like infrastructure, talent development, skills matching, and technology adoption, the Portulans Institute\u2019s Index can help countries focus their efforts to get the biggest returns on investment. For example, the Index suggests that Brazil, which ranks 67th globally on the Index, could sprint ahead with more adoption of digital technologies like cloud, AI and machine learning. \nSeizing the chance to sprint ahead\nEmerging economies have a key advantage. Unlike developed economies \u2014 which need to upgrade or replace outdated legacy infrastructure \u2014 many emerging markets can leapfrog ahead, building advanced tools from scratch rather than remodeling existing ones. (Think of how many countries without extensive landline telephone infrastructures in the 1990s have become leaders in mobile telephony adoption.)\nStarting with the latest technologies can streamline progress. But which technologies, and what\u2019s the right balance of investing in human capital, infrastructure and other critical elements? And which policies will accelerate progress and yield the greatest gains in competitiveness? The Index provides some objective comparisons to help answer those questions.\nGood public policy that supports technology innovation can expand the pie for everyone.\u00a0 Widely dispersed technological progress has doubled human lifespans over the last century and lifted more than a billion people from poverty in the last thirty years alone. Evidence-based investments, policies and digital tools will equip emerging economies to make even more progress in the years ahead.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

If the past two years have shown us anything, it\u2019s that tackling global problems like pandemics, economic inequality and climate change demand global collaboration, across borders and across sectors. At Google, we\u2019re committed to doing our part.Earlier this year, I wrote about how we are accelerating our partnerships with international organizations in a number of areas. For example, since the start of the pandemic, we've launched more than 200 new products, provided over $150 million to public health officials to promote vaccine education, and enhanced existing products like Google Search and Maps to highlight authoritative information about COVID-19 and local vaccination sites. We\u2019ve also continued to increase our support for the UN by providing over $250 million in Ad Grants, which has enabled it to serve over 1.6 billion ads and reach people in more than 200 countries with messages about COVID-19 prevention, vaccine safety and more.\u00a0At UNGA this year, we will be deepening our collaboration with international organizations as we add our voice to critical policy discussions, share what we have learned from our partnerships, and seek out new ways to collaborate with multi-stakeholder groups.Here are just a few events at which we\u2019ll be participating next week around key issues.\nEconomic Recovery\u00a0\nWhile the pandemic has exacerbated economic inequality around the world, the data shows that nations that adopt technology are poised to recover quicker. According to recent research, 16 emerging countries could generate as much as $3.4 trillion of economic value through digital transformation by 2030.\u00a0On September 20, Google SVP of Global Affairs Kent Walker will join the Concordia Summit to discuss a new Future Readiness Index commissioned by Google and developed by the Portulans Institute. This interactive tool is designed to help governments use key metrics and data to make sound investments in technology, infrastructure and talent.Later next week, Kent and I will join the Leaders on Purpose Summit\u00a0for conversations about how the private sector and governments can work together to help more people prepare for jobs, and how sound digital policies can help governments drive economic opportunity and growth.\nSustainability and Climate Action\nTechnology has an important role to play in tackling climate change, and we\u2019ve long been committed to advancing the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals and collaborating with UN entities like the Framework Convention on Climate Change to drive progress. We were the first major company to be carbon neutral and match 100% of our annual electricity use with renewables, and now we\u2019re working to be the first major company to operate on\u00a024/7 carbon-free energy\u00a0by 2030.On September 24 at the UN High Level Dialogue on Energy, our CFO Ruth Porat will call on other companies and governments to join the Sustainable Energy for All-Google\u00a024/7 Carbon Free Energy Compact. Ruth will also speak at the kickoff of Climate Week on September 20 to discuss how we are working to achieve sustainability at scale and fulfill our commitment to offer 1 billion people new ways to live more sustainably by 2022 via our core products.\nMusic and Culture\nIn celebration of Beethoven\u2019s 250th birthday, Google Arts & Culture and YouTube collaborated with other worldwide partners on the Global Ode To Joy project. Through this initiative, which is a fitting contribution to the UN\u2019s International Year of the Creative Economy for Sustainable Development, thousands of users, top-tier artists, and orchestras from more than 70 countries came together to create and share videos of Beethoven\u2019s music. On September 22, Kent will host a panel during the Concordia Summit with participants from the Ode to Joy campaign to discuss how music is bringing people together during the pandemic.To be sure, with many events this year again virtual, UNGA 2021 will be a little different from years past. But the opportunities it presents for engagement with partners from around the world remain rich, and the need for collaboration substantial. Whether in person or over a screen, Google is \u201call in\u201d when it comes to supporting the UN\u2019s vision of multilateral and multi-stakeholder approaches to confronting the world\u2019s biggest challenges.\u00a0 \nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

The meeting comes at a timely moment, as widespread cyberattacks continue to exploit vulnerabilities targeting people, organizations, and governments around the world.That\u2019s why today, we are announcing that we will invest $10 billion over the next five years to strengthen cybersecurity, including expanding zero-trust programs, helping secure the software supply chain, and enhancing open-source security. We are also pledging, through the Google Career Certificate program, to train 100,000 Americans in fields like IT Support and Data Analytics, learning in-demand skills including data privacy and security.\u00a0Governments and businesses are at a watershed moment in addressing cybersecurity. Cyber attacks are increasingly endangering valuable data and critical infrastructure. While we welcome increased measures to reinforce cybersecurity, governments and companies are both facing key challenges:\u00a0First, organizations continue to depend on vulnerable legacy infrastructure and software, rather than adopting modern IT and security practices. Too many governments still rely on legacy vendor contracts that limit competition and choice, inflate costs, and create privacy and security risks.\u00a0Second, nation-state actors, cybercriminals and other malicious actors continue to target weaknesses in software supply chains and many vendors don\u2019t have the tools or expertise to stop them.\u00a0Third, countries simply don\u2019t have enough people trained to anticipate and deal with these threats.\u00a0For the past two decades, Google has made security the cornerstone of our product strategy. We don\u2019t just plug security holes, we work to eliminate entire classes of threats for consumers and businesses whose work depends on our services. By making all of our products secure by default, we keep more users safe than anyone else in the world \u2014 blocking malware, phishing attempts, spam messages, and potential cyber attacks. We\u2019ve published over 160 academic research papers on computer security, privacy, and abuse prevention, and we warn other software companies of weaknesses in their systems. And dedicated teams like our Threat Analysis Group work to counter government-backed hacking and attacks against Google and our users, making the internet safer for everyone.Extending the zero-trust security model\u00a0We\u2019re one of the pioneers in zero-trust computing, in which no person, device, or network enjoys inherent trust.\u00a0 Trust that allows access to information must be earned.\u00a0 We\u2019ve learned a lot about both the power and the challenges of running this model at scale.\u00a0Implemented properly, zero-trust computing provides the highest level of security for organizations.\u00a0 We support the White House effort to deploy this model across the federal government.\u00a0As government and industry work together to develop and implement zero-trust solutions for employee access to corporate assets, we also need to apply the approach to production environments. This is necessary to address events like Solarwinds, where attackers used access to the production environment to compromise dozens of outside entities. The U.S. government can encourage adoption by expanding zero-trust guidelines and reference architecture language in the Executive Order implementation process to include production environments, which in addition to application segmentation substantially improves an organization\u2019s defense in depth strategy.\u00a0Securing the software supply chain\u00a0Following the Solarwinds attack, the software world gained a deeper understanding of the real risks and ramifications of supply chain attacks. Today, the vast majority of modern software development makes use of open source software, including software incorporated in many aspects of critical infrastructure and national security systems. Despite this, there is no formal requirement or standard for maintaining the security of that software. Most of the work that is done to enhance the security of open source software, including fixing known vulnerabilities, is done on an ad hoc basis.\u00a0That\u2019s why we worked with the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) to develop and release Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA or \u201csalsa\u201d), a proven framework for securing the software supply chain. In our view, wide support for and adoption of the SLSA framework will raise the security bar for the entire software ecosystem.\u00a0To further advance our work and the broader community\u2019s work in this space, we committed to invest in the expansion of the application of the SLSA framework to protect the key components of open-source software widely used by many organizations. We also pledged to provide $100 million to support third-party foundations, like OpenSSF, that manage open source security priorities and help fix vulnerabilities.Strengthening the digital security skills of the American workforceRobust cybersecurity ultimately depends on having the people to implement it. That includes people with digital skills capable of designing and executing cybersecurity solutions, as well as promoting awareness of cybersecurity risks and protocols among the broader population. In short, we need more and better computer security education and training.\u00a0\u00a0Over the next three years, we're pledging to help 100,000 Americans earn Google Career Certificates in fields like IT Support and Data Analytics to learn in-demand skills including data privacy and security. The certificates are industry-recognized and supported credentials that equip Americans with the skills they need to get high-paying, high-growth jobs. To date, more than half of our graduates have come from backgrounds underserved in tech (Black, Latinx, veteran, or female). 46% of our graduates come from the lowest income tertile in the country. And the results are strong: 82% of our graduates report a positive career impact within six months of graduation. Additionally, we will train over 10 million Americans in digital skills from basic to advanced by 2023.Leading the world in cybersecurity is critical to our national security. Today\u2019s meeting at the White House was both an acknowledgment of the threats we face and a call to action to address them. It emphasized cybersecurity as a global imperative and encouraged new ways of thinking and partnering across government, industry and academia. We look forward to working with the Administration and others to define and drive a new era in cybersecurity. Our collective safety, economic growth, and future innovation depend on it.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2021-07-07 02:02:00+00:00", "title": "A lawsuit that ignores choice on Android and Google Play", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/", "post_text": "We built Android to create more choices in mobile technology. Today, anyone, including our competitors, can customize and build devices with the Android operating system \u2014 for free.\u00a0\nWe also built an app store, Google Play, that helps people download apps on their devices. If you don\u2019t find the app you\u2019re looking for in Google Play, you can choose to download the app from a rival app store or directly from a developer\u2019s website. We don\u2019t impose the same restrictions as other mobile operating systems do.\nSo it\u2019s strange that a group of state attorneys general chose to file a lawsuit attacking a system that provides more openness and choice than others. This complaint mimics a similarly meritless lawsuit filed by the large app developer Epic Games, which has benefitted from Android\u2019s openness by distributing its Fortnite app outside of Google Play.\nHere\u2019s more detail on how this lawsuit gets it wrong:\nGoogle Play competes vigorously and fairly\nThe complaint limits its definition of the app marketplace to Android devices only. This completely ignores the competition we face from other platforms such as Apple's incredibly successful app store, which accounts for the majority of mobile app store revenues according to third-party estimates. We compete for both developers and consumers, and if we\u2019re not providing them with the best experience on Google Play, they have other alternatives to choose from.\nAndroid increases competition and choice\nThis complaint alleges that consumers and developers have no option other than to use Google Play. But that\u2019s not correct. Choice has always been a core tenet of Android. Device makers and carriers can preload competing app stores alongside Google Play on their devices. In fact, most Android devices ship with two or more app stores preloaded. And popular Android devices such as the Amazon Fire tablet come preloaded with a competitive app store and no Google Play Store.\nConsumers can also \u201csideload\u201d apps, meaning they can download them from a developer\u2019s website directly without going through Google Play at all. People sideload successful apps like Fortnite, as well as entire app stores like the Amazon Appstore, neither of which are distributed through Google Play.\n            Video format not supported\n          \nContributing to this openness and choice, we also give developers more ways to interact with their customers compared to other operating systems. For example, Google Play allows developers to communicate with their customers outside the app about subscription offers or a lower-cost offering on a rival app store or the developer\u2019s website.\nGoogle Play helps developers succeed\nThe complaint suggests that Google Play somehow inhibits developers\u2019 ability to grow. Even though developers have a range of distribution options on Android, we\u2019re proud that, as of February 2020, developers had earned over $80 billion through Google Play. And in 2020, the Android app economy, including Google Play, helped create nearly 2 million American jobs.\u00a0\nWe provide resources to help developers build great apps, lower their costs and grow their businesses. This includes tools that help developers reduce testing burdens, run beta tests and monitor their app at scale. We also invest significantly in security. Google Play Protect, our security service, now scans more than 100 billion apps every day; in 2019, it prevented 1.9 billion malware installs.\nThe economic model of Play and Android benefits developers\nThe complaint is peppered with inflammatory language designed to distract from the fact that our rules on Android and Google Play benefit consumers. We stand behind apps distributed on Google Play, so we do have some rules to keep the store secure, protect privacy and prevent fraud. For example, we have rules around spam, app reviews and inappropriate content. These rules don't harm consumers; they help protect their safety and security. People want and expect this when using their phones.\u00a0\nUnder our Google Play billing policy, the 3% of developers who actually sell digital products or content use Google Play\u2019s billing system and are subject to a progressive service fee: 15% on the first $1 million earned (99% of developers who pay any fee earn less than a million dollars), and then 30% for earnings above $1 million. Some large app developers, like Epic, want preferential rates and want to use their own payment processing system, but that would harm the ecosystem as a whole.\nFirst, our current business model benefits the overwhelming majority of developers. About 97% of developers today don\u2019t sell digital content on Google Play and therefore aren't subject to a service fee. Less than 0.1% of developers \u2014 who are the largest and most profitable on Google Play \u2014 are subject to a 30% service fee on some transactions. This lawsuit is essentially on behalf of that 0.1% of developers. Moreover, the complaint conspicuously fails to mention that our fee is comparable to other rival digital stores, including the Samsung Galaxy Store, Amazon Appstore, Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo Switch and Apple App Store.\u00a0\nSecond, a centralized billing system protects consumers from fraud and gives consumers an easy way to track purchases in one place. It also enables us to provide robust parental and safety controls and subscription management tools that are critical to consumer trust.\nEven with these rules, it\u2019s worth reiterating: Developers who don\u2019t like our policies can still distribute their apps to Android users directly or through rival app stores without using our billing system or paying us a cent \u2014 and many do.\u00a0\nA meritless lawsuit that ignores Android\u2019s openness\nWe understand that scrutiny is appropriate, and we\u2019re committed to engaging with regulators. But Android and Google Play provide openness and choice that other platforms simply don\u2019t. This lawsuit isn\u2019t about helping the little guy or protecting consumers. It\u2019s about boosting a handful of major app developers who want the benefits of Google Play without paying for it. Doing so risks raising costs for small developers, impeding their ability to innovate and compete, and making apps across the Android ecosystem less secure for consumers.\u00a0\nFor more information on Google Play, please visit our Android developer blog.\u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Over the past year, searches for \"food bank near me\", \"Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\", \"food stamps application\" and \"school lunch pick up\" reached record highs.\u00a0Starting today, you can find free food support all in one place on our new Find Food Support site. The site features a Google Maps locator tool to help you find the nearest food bank, food pantry or school lunch program pickup site in your community.

Mass school closures made food insecurity five times worse for children who previously relied on free school lunch programs. Black and Latino communities, disabled Americans and those without a college degree have been disproportionately impacted. And according to a recent survey of military families from the Military Family Advisory Network, one in five families reported experiencing food insecurity.Still, the stigma associated with getting help can be a barrier for many.

But I wasn\u2019t the only one who witnessed this. We\u2019ve all heard how the pandemic has affected vulnerable communities across the country due to structural and long-standing health inequities. Even so, there was no central resource to help consolidate, visualize and understand the data on a national scale.\u00a0Over the past year a team of Google.org Fellows and I worked with the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at Morehouse School of Medicine and a multi-disciplinary Health Equity Taskforce to understand COVID-19 health inequities. Today, we released The Health Equity Tracker (HET), a publicly available data platform that visually displays and contextualizes the health disparities facing communities of color throughout the U.S.With $1.5 million of Google.org grant funding and over 15,000 pro bono hours donated from 18 Google.org Fellows, the HET parses through a mountain of public health data to record COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations nationwide across race and ethnicity, sex and age, as well as state and county. The tracker also measures social and systemic factors \u2014 like poverty and lack of health insurance \u2014 that exacerbate these inequities and have resulted in higher COVID-19 death rates for people of color, especially Black and Latinx communities.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe HET allows users to compare public health data on a local and national level.\u00a0\nCollecting this data showed us where there are gaps in our knowledge. Public health data can be inconsistent, collected in silos or missing completely. Knowing where these blindspots are is valuable. When we\u2019re aware of unknown or missing data, we\u2019re able to take action toward improving data collection and reporting standards.The tracker currently focuses on data analysis for COVID-19, but in the future we expect to be able to track additional conditions, like mental and behavioral health. And we\u2019ll include analysis of health inequities for people with disabilities, the LGBTQ+ community and those facing socio economic challenges.\u00a0For me, the process of creating this during a time of devastation has helped me translate mourning into meaning.

The visit comes nearly 15 years after the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) was signed, creating a historic economic and strategic partnership between our nations.\nAs a former trade negotiator for the U.S. government, I helped negotiate this agreement to further the United States\u2019 and Korea\u2019s shared goal of lowering trade barriers and strengthening our economic cooperation. In the years since KORUS was signed, I\u2019m proud to see how much the U.S-Korea economic relationship has matured. Bilateral trade in goods and services has increased from $104 billion in 2007 to nearly $170 billion in 2019. U.S. exports to Korea today support an estimated 358,000 jobs. And KORUS has shown that government leadership can spur private sector collaboration, unlocking new opportunities for cooperation across the Pacific and benefiting consumers.\u00a0\nGoogle\u2019s experiences offer a great case in point. Over the past decade, we have partnered with great Korean companies to bring better products to consumers in Korea, the U.S. and the world. For example, we have closely collaborated with companies like Samsung and LG to expand access to innovative smartphones and devices for everyone. That, in turn, has nurtured a digital economy where developers are able to distribute their apps to global markets and grow their businesses. Just this week, we announced our newest initiative: Google and Samsung are unifying our wearable device operating systems, which will provide consumers with powerful health information and the ability to communicate on the go, while creating new opportunities for developers and device makers. We\u2019ve similarly had great partnerships with other Korean technology leaders like SK, Hyundai Motor, Kakao, NCSoft, Nexon and NetMarble.\nToday, the U.S. and Korea are at an important inflection point in our economic alliance, as our nations recover from the effects of COVID-19. We can reenergize our bilateral relationship by partnering even more closely on technology. The U.S. and Korea are among the world\u2019s leaders in technology \u2014 in everything from smartphones and software to apps and artificial intelligence. These complementary strengths present an enormous opportunity for deeper collaboration.\u00a0\nThere is, however, still a great deal of work ahead to realize that opportunity. There remain a number of areas where collaboration would be strengthened by better alignment on technology and digital regulation and policy. As we have seen globally in recent years, unilateral attempts to regulate the digital economy deter trade and create obstacles for greater investment. Inconsistent regulations make it harder for companies to work together, increase costs for consumers, and risk fragmenting the global, open internet that both countries rely on.\nThat\u2019s why we believe Presidents Biden and Moon should launch a high-level dialogue on technology issues. Such a dialogue would elevate the importance of technology cooperation, enhance supply chain resiliency and promote common rules of the road for the digital space that will preserve an open, free and secure global internet. This dialogue would also help the two countries jointly address challenges in the technology space that risk deterring trade in our sector and beyond.\nAn enhanced technology relationship would serve the two countries\u2019 economic interests, including the thousands of American and Korean small and medium-sized businesses that rely on digital tools to reach customers and stay connected. And it's not just our economies that would benefit. Increasingly, technology cooperation is also at the core of our security alliance. A common approach to digital standards and mutual commitment to transparent, non-discriminatory, and interoperable regulatory frameworks would reinforce that alliance, while also enabling digital cooperation across the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.\u00a0\nThe U.S.-Korea alliance has endured because of our shared values and belief that we are best positioned to tackle future challenges working in partnership. Technology represents the future of both our economies. By putting digital cooperation high on the bilateral agenda and launching a technology dialogue, the U.S. and Korea can give new momentum to our economic and strategic alliance, propelling it for the next 15 years.\u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

That is why we have advocated for a fair and competitive immigration system. And that is why now\u00a0\u2014\u00a0as the U.S. emerges from a pandemic only to face unprecedented global competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we support a system that offers opportunities to highly-skilled workers and their families, and cements the citizenship of Dreamers, rather than miring immigrants in decade-long application backlogs. \nA fair immigration system is necessary to preserve America\u2019s laudable history of welcoming people from different places and to fuel a virtuous cycle of innovation. Unfortunately, an impending court case is putting both at risk at the most inopportune moment.\nThe case in question is an attempt to end the issuing of work authorization (H-4 EAD) for certain spouses of high-skilled talent who have come to this country on H-1B visas. In other words, it seeks to end the ability of highly-skilled immigrants\u2019 partners from working in the United States. This H-4 EAD program provides work authorization to more than 90,000 H-4 visa-holders \u2014 more than 90% of whom are women. The pandemic has already disproportionately impacted women and ending this program would only make things worse, leading to disrupted careers and lost wages. Furthemore, if the program is lost, the practical effect is that we welcome a person to the U.S. to work but we make it harder for their spouse to work. That hurts their family, impacts our ability to compete for talent, and harms our economy.\nTo support this important program, we are leading an amicus brief with over 40 companies and organizations to preserve and protect the H-4 EAD program. This builds on an amicus brief we recently joined in support of a lawsuit filed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association to expedite the delayed processing time of H-4 work authorizations.\nAs an immigrant myself, I have been the beneficiary of a welcoming America and I hope we can ensure that same welcome for future immigrants by preserving the H-4 EAD program. Ending this program would hurt families and undercut the US economy at a critical moment.\u00a0To read the legal details of why we are urging the court to reject this attempt to end the H-4 EAD please click here.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

In an interconnected world, such collaboration depends on international organizations that bring together governments, the private sector and civil society. And we think technology can help. \nWe\u2019ve recently seen how technology-enabled solutions like smartphone-based exposure notifications can support public health authorities in the fight against COVID-19, machine-learning models can reduce energy consumption, and AI can address cybersecurity challenges posed by hackers and spam.\u00a0 We at Google are proud to be investing billions in R&D each year to innovate new technologies to help address the world\u2019s biggest cross-border problems.\nTo be sure, our relationship with international institutions is a two-way street. Our development of new technologies is guided by multilateral frameworks like the United Nations (UN) Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. More broadly, we, like every company, benefit from the good work done by institutions ranging from the World Health Organization (WHO) to the World Bank in securing public health, strengthening the global economy and resolving conflict. And we value international organizations' ability to shape global agendas and drive multi-stakeholder consensus \u2014 like how the OECD is working to reform global tax regimes or the World Trade Organization is working to promote a framework for digital trade.\nThis year, Google\u2019s plan is to accelerate our partnerships with international organizations on four fronts.\n1. Slowing the pandemic and supporting economic recovery. At the beginning of the pandemic, we wanted to help people find answers by surfacing critical information and leading global initiatives like \u201cDo the Five\u201d and \u201cWear a Mask.\u201d For the first time, we partnered with the WHO to run public service health announcements through Google Search and YouTube. This partnership has led to campaigns in more than 100 countries and has driven over 1 billion ads served (impressions, or views) and 115 million clicks to the WHO website, educating users about the disease and fighting the infodemic. In recent months, we\u2019ve turned our focus to helping millions of people around the world acquire the necessary skills to participate in the post-pandemic digital economy, and we\u2019ll continue to support digital transformation of economies and communities to ensure that we step back into a stronger, resilient and more inclusive world.\n2. Artificial intelligence and innovation. Building off our longstanding support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we will continue to work with UN agencies to develop AI in a way that meaningfully improves people\u2019s lives. For example, we\u2019ve partnered with the UN World Food Programme to develop an AI-enabled tool to improve the delivery of disaster aid, and with UN-ESCAP and the Association of Pacific Rim Universities to launch an AI for Social Good report. We believe AI can be a transformational tool to support the goals of multilateral institutions.\n3. Sustainability. Sustainability has been a core Google value since our founding. Now in our third decade of climate action, we\u2019re working to help fulfill the vision of the UN SDGs and the Paris Agreement, becoming the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy and committing to operate 24/7 on carbon-free energy by 2030. But we are also taking action far beyond our own operations, working with international organizations like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to create tools like the Environmental Insights Explorer and our breakthrough AI for building energy efficiency that help everyone move towards a carbon-free world.\n4.\u00a0Open internet and human rights. The advent of the internet a generation ago fast-tracked human rights around the world in a way history had never seen. Google's commitment to human rights, including to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, dates back to our earliest years. Cognizant of the alarming realities behind the gendered impact of the pandemic, we have had a particular focus on gender equality. That's why Google joined the Generation Equality Forum as a member of the Action Coalition for Technology and Innovation for Gender Equality; our Ad Grants partnership with UN Women has already enabled over seven million public service announcements in over 237 countries, raising awareness of the outsized impact of COVID-19 on women and girls. This year we also launched the Google.org Impact Challenge for Women and Girls, a first-of-its-kind program to empower women and girls to reach their full economic potential. \nWhile we accelerate our work in these four areas, Google is committed to supporting international organizations to tackle the next generation of cross-border challenges that lay over the horizon. In an era of growing skepticism of government institutions, that starts by rebuilding trust and consensus in the value of working globally to solve problems.\nAs a technology company inspired by the power of human resilience, we can think of no better way to honor the setbacks, sacrifices and hardships of a battle-wearied world than to work with organizations committed to helping everyone \u2014 and doing our part by building the tools and technologies to make their vision possible.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Government R&D investment has led to economic growth, jobs and new startups. As just one example, some of Google\u2019s earliest work was made possible, in part, by the Digital Library Initiative, funded by the National Science Foundation.\nBut if you fast forward to today, the U.S. government investment in tech has moved to the slow lane. Government-funded research in the U.S. has fallen by 60% as a percentage of GDP\u00a0\u2014\u00a0from 1.9% of GDP in 1964 to just 0.7% today. Many countries around the world are investing significantly in research and development. For example, China has said that it will be increasing government R&D funding by 7% annually and recently announced a five-year plan to invest an additional $1.4 trillion in developing next-generation technologies.\nAs a nation we now have a historic opportunity to put aside partisanship and come together on an issue that will determine our future competitiveness. The United States must seize the moment to cultivate science and technology by setting out a national innovation strategy, and we commit to doing our part.\nSenators Schumer and Young have introduced the bipartisan Endless Frontier Act \u2014 an important step in putting to work America\u2019s strengths in science and technology to tackle some of the biggest issues of our time, from climate change to global health. Legislative proposals to increase funding for the National Science Foundation will accelerate innovation in the technologies of the future \u2014 including quantum computing, AI, biotech and genomics, advanced wireless networks, and robotics \u2014 and strengthen the U.S. innovation ecosystem through regional hubs spread throughout the country.\nWe are also encouraged to see that key components of President Biden\u2019s American Jobs Plan call for increased investment in R&D, including focus on advanced manufacturing, support for underrepresented students in STEM, and collaboration with U.S. universities. We hope Congress can come together in a bipartisan way to support extra investment in research and development.\nBeyond direct support for R&D, our national innovation strategy should include support for immigration reform, entrepreneurial start-ups, regulatory clarity, and open data and interoperability.\nAmerica\u2019s leadership in science and technology comes in part from our unmatched ability to recruit, train, and retain the world\u2019s best talent. Our doors must be open to the best and the brightest, and we should make it easier for experts in vital technology fields to come to the United States and help grow our innovation economy. In parallel, a renewed focus on STEM education, skills-based training, and school-to-work apprenticeship programs will empower American workers and promote job and wage growth around the country.\nAmerica\u2019s innovation framework should work for businesses of all sizes.\u00a0 At a time when we\u2019re seeing record-setting investment in the promise of new companies, the government can pitch in by expanding access to public resources such as data, software, and computing infrastructure. Streamlined government contracting will also make it easier for startups to bid for large contracts and gain commercial opportunities.\nTech breakthroughs are built on accumulated and shared knowledge \u2014 we all stand on the shoulders of others. Data interoperability and open-source software help all of us, including smaller companies and research organizations. The government should promote interoperability, open data, and open-source applications by more actively sharing public data and contributing to open-source platforms.\nClear, balanced and consistent regulations can unlock innovation while protecting consumers and ensuring an equal playing field. Any new generation of technology raises important new questions and requires a balancing of concerns. At the same time, streamlining regulatory burdens can speed great new products to market, helping smaller companies who can struggle to comply with costly or complex rules.\nLarger companies like Google and Alphabet have an important role to play in supporting this work, and our public reports show that we\u2019ve invested more than $100 billion in R&D over the last five years. We\u2019ll keep publishing our findings in scientific journals and support public research through public-private partnerships, like our work with NSF on the National AI Research Institute for Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration and our breakthroughs in quantum computing. We also launched Google Career Certificates to help workers develop the skills they need and share in the benefits of growing industries. And because open data and open-source code are essential for innovation, we host a large number of publicly available datasets, services, and software accessible to everyone.\nWe welcome the moves made in recent days and weeks to support America\u2019s innovation leadership.\u00a0 We\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities to collaborate with government, academic institutions, and others to do our part.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

International agreements to eliminate barriers to trade in technology goods and services helped enable dramatic increases in technology trade, while countries looked to promote foreign investment in the cutting-edge technologies of the future.\u00a0 Consumers everywhere got access to new, lower-priced technology, millions of jobs were created and businesses from Paris to Pittsburgh have been able to reach new customers around the world, generating trillions of dollars in sales.Times have changed: We\u2019re all using digital tools, and recognizing the risks of abuse and the need for responsible innovation. But while well-crafted regulation can help unlock the benefits of technology, an explosion in national policies is detering trade in technology. Those barriers include not just tariffs (which have also beset other sectors), but also trade controls, discriminatory taxes, investment restrictions and novel digital regulations aimed straight at foreign-headquartered companies. In short, we\u2019re seeing the erosion of a carefully nurtured global trading system that has contributed to progress and prosperity in the U.S. and around the world.\u00a0\u00a0This erosion of trade norms isn\u2019t limited to the U.S.-China relationship. Even more concerningly, the technology trade relationship between the U.S. and Europe \u2014 once one of the closest in the world \u2014 is fraying.\u00a0\u00a0In Washington, in recent years, \u201ctransatlantic tech policy\u201d has been largely reduced to pressing Europe to follow U.S. supply chain initiatives. Meanwhile Europe has undertaken a broad series of unilateral initiatives in areas ranging from digital taxes to market regulation. Transatlantic coordination has largely become an afterthought, if it\u2019s thought of at all.\u00a0These policy trends hurt both the U.S. and European economies, risking the 16 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic linked to transatlantic trade and investment. They also make it harder for the U.S. and the EU to address new global technology challenges and partner with emerging economies in Asia.But there\u2019s a better path forward. Coming out of the pandemic, with new momentum behind bilateral cooperation, we have a chance to revitalize the transatlantic technology trade relationship.The European Commission recently proposed an EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC).\u00a0 The United States should accept the invitation \u2014\u00a0and build on it. An expedited high-level trade dialogue on technology issues is critical to avoid unilateral approaches on pressing issues like data flows that are essential to commerce, regulation of digital platforms that we all use every day, and other essential components of a modern economy. A TTC could also prevent divergence on emerging areas like artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies and promote cooperation on third-country technology challenges.\u00a0Of course a TTC needs to be set up for success. When entering trade negotiations, each side typically avoids preemptive or unilateral actions that might foreclose meaningful alignment. In entering a TTC, both sides should commit to meaningful consultation before taking any further actions harming transatlantic tech trade. The U.S. should not enact new privacy or technology trade control regulations without consulting with the EU; the EU should pursue bilateral consultation to ensure technology initiatives like the Digital Markets Act reflect the EU-U.S. values-based alliance. Quickly forming a TTC can help drive a consistent and non-discriminatory approach on these challenging new areas of technology regulation.The need for alignment has never been greater or more urgent. An aligned approach will promote more tech-enabled economic growth; tech-supported measures to tackle other shared challenges like climate change; and new norms to ensure that technology will \u2014 in the words of\u00a0 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2014 \u201cprotect your privacy, make the world safer and healthier, and make democracies more resilient.\u201d\u00a0The historic partnership between Europe and the U.S. faces a profound challenge \u2014 but also an opportunity to re-build based on shared values of openness and connectivity. As European Commission Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis said recently: \u201cThe bottom line is simple: whatever challenges the EU and U.S. face, there is no stronger values-based alliance in the world \u2026 So, even if the current crisis feeds the temptation to look inward, this is not the answer.\u201d We couldn\u2019t agree more.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Read it in full below.\nChairman Doyle, Ranking Member Latta, Chairwoman Schakowsky, Ranking Member Bilirakis, Full Committee Chair Pallone and Full Committee Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.This month, the worldwide web turned 32. Over the past three decades, we\u2019ve seen the web inspire the best in society, by expanding knowledge, powering businesses, and providing opportunities for expression, discovery, and connection \u2014 no matter who you are, or where you live.I joined Google in 2004 because I believed the internet was the best way to bring the benefits of technology to more people, and I believe that still today.\u00a0I am proud that Americans can turn to Google for help in moments that matter, whether they\u2019re looking for COVID vaccine information on Search and Maps, working and learning from home using Google Workspace or Google Classroom, learning new skills on YouTube, or using our digital tools to grow their businesses. In 2020, our products helped 2 million U.S. businesses, publishers, and others generate $426 billion in economic activity. And we helped billions of people find comfort and connection in an otherwise awful year.\u00a0Beyond our products, we were proud to announce last week our plans to invest over $7 billion in data centers and offices across 19 states, and create at least 10,000 full-time Google jobs in the U.S. That\u2019s in addition to the 84,000 employees we currently employ across the country. And according to an Oxford Economics report, YouTube's creative ecosystem supported the equivalent of 345,000 full time jobs in 2019.\u00a0We are energized by the opportunity to help people at scale, and we are humbled by the responsibility that comes with it. We have thousands of people focused on everything from cyber attacks, to data privacy, to today\u2019s topic: misinformation.\u00a0Our mission at Google is to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Core to that mission is providing trustworthy content and opportunities for free expression across our platforms, while limiting the reach of harmful misinformation.It\u2019s a large, dynamic challenge without easy answers. More than 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, and approximately 15% of the searches on Google each day are new to us. Eighteen months ago most people hadn\u2019t heard of COVID-19; sadly, coronavirus was the top trending search of 2020.\nResponding to the events of January 6Staying ahead of these challenges and keeping users safe and secure on our platforms is a top priority. We saw how high those stakes can be on January 6, 2021, when a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol. This was an unprecedented and tragic event, and Google strongly condemns these violent attacks on our democracy, and mourns the lives lost.\u00a0In response, our teams worked to raise up authoritative news sources across our products. Teams at YouTube quickly took down any live streams or videos that violated our incitement to violence policies, and on January 7, we began issuing strikes to those in violation of our presidential election integrity policy. In the Play Store, we removed apps for violating our policies on inciting violence. We also prohibited advertisers from running ads that referenced the 2020 election or topics related to the Capitol riots in the scope of our Sensitive Events policy.\u00a0\nDoing our part to contribute to the integrity of the U.S. 2020 electionWe were able to act quickly because of the investments we made to prepare for the 2020 elections. Last year, teams across Google and YouTube worked around the clock to contribute to election preparedness, by helping voters find authoritative information about the election; by working with campaigns to equip them with best-in-class security features and helping them connect with voters; and by protecting our platforms from abuse.\u00a0Helping voters find authoritative information on our servicesThis U.S. election cycle saw all-time highs in searches on Google for civics-related topics. Anticipating that need, we worked to launch features that would help people find the information to participate in the democratic process, including how to register and how to vote in their states.\u00a0Consistent with our approach to prior election cycles, we showed \u201chow to register\u201d and \u201chow to vote\u201d reminders to all our U.S. users directly on Google Search, Maps and YouTube. These reminders were seen over 2 billion times across our products. As the election neared, we helped people find polling and ballot drop off locations: From mid-October through Election Day, we added more than 125,000 voting locations in Google Maps. Across our products, these features were seen nearly 500 million times.\u00a0Finally, starting on Election Day, we worked with the Associated Press to provide real-time election results for relevant searches on Google. These results had over six times more views in 2020 than in 2016. Similarly, on YouTube, we launched an election results information panel that showed on top of search results and under videos with election-related content. It pointed to our election results page on Google, and over time, we expanded it to include an additional link pointing to a page on the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) website that debunked incorrect claims made about the integrity of the elections. Once the safe harbor deadline for state certification passed, we updated this YouTube Election Results Information Panel again to point to the National Archives Office of the Federal Register page of record for the 2020 electoral college vote. Collectively, our election information panels on YouTube have been shown over 8 billion times.\u00a0Working with campaignsWe also helped campaigns and elected officials effectively use Google and YouTube products to reach voters and enhance their election security. As part of our Civics Outreach Virtual Training Series, Google held 21 training sessions for over 900 candidates, campaigns, public officials, and nonprofit leaders. Overall, we held 45 group and individual trainings to help more than 2,900 election workers learn to use Google tools to amplify their message and better connect with voters through events like digital town halls, debates and virtual campaign rallies.In addition, as a part of our Election Cybersecurity Initiative with the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School, nearly 4,000 elected officials, secretaries of state, campaign staffers, political party representatives, and state election directors in all 50 states received training on ways to secure their information and protect their campaigns against cyberattacks.\u00a0At the start of the 2020 election season, we partnered with Defending Digital Campaigns (DDC), a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization, to give any eligible federal campaign access to free Titan Security Keys \u2014 the strongest form of two-factor authentication. This collaboration is a part of our Advanced Protection Program, which protects high-risk individuals, such as election officials, campaigns, and journalists, who have access to high visibility and sensitive information. In the lead-up to the 2020 elections, DDC distributed more than 10,000 Titan Security key bundles to more than 140 U.S. federal campaigns. We recently expanded our support for DDC to provide eligible campaigns and political parties, committees, and related organizations, at both the federal and state levels, with knowledge, training and resources to defend themselves from security threats.Protecting our platforms from abuseIn the years leading up to the 2020 election, we made numerous enhancements to protect the integrity of elections around the world and better secure our platforms. Among them, we introduced strict policies and processes for identity verification for advertisers who run election-related advertising on our platform; we launched comprehensive political ad libraries in the U.S. and in other countries around the world; we developed and implemented policies to prohibit election-related abuse such as voter suppression and deceptive practices on platforms like YouTube, Google Ads, Google Maps and Google Play; our Threat Analysis Group (TAG) launched a quarterly bulletin to provide regular updates on our work to combat coordinated influence operations across our platforms and flagged phishing attempts against the presidential campaigns; and we worked closely with government agencies, including the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force, and other companies to share information around suspected election interference campaigns.\u00a0On YouTube, throughout 2020, we identified and removed content that was misleading voters about where or how to vote, to help ensure viewers saw accurate information about the upcoming election. After December 8, which marked the \"safe harbor\" deadline for states to certify their election, in accordance with our Presidential Election Integrity policy we began to remove content uploaded on or after December 9 that misled people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In addition, we continued to enforce our broader policies \u2014 for instance, from October to December 2020, we removed 13,000 YouTube channels for promoting violence and violent extremism; 89% of videos removed for violating our violent extremism policy were taken down before they had 10 views.\u00a0This work was in addition to improvements in the ranking systems we use to reduce the spread of harmful misinformation on YouTube: In January 2019, we announced that we would begin reducing recommendations of borderline content or videos that could misinform viewers in harmful ways but that do not violate YouTube Community Guidelines. Since then, we've launched numerous changes to reduce recommendations of borderline content and harmful misinformation, and we continue to invest in this work: Our models review more than 100,000 hours of videos every day to find and limit the spread of borderline content.Our work is never done, and we continue to learn and improve from one election cycle to the next, and continue to evolve our policies. That principle has guided our approach to new and evolving challenges, including COVID-19 misinformation.\nAddressing the challenge of COVID-19 misinformationThis past year we\u2019ve also focused on providing quality information during the pandemic. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, teams across Google have worked to provide quality information and resources to help keep people safe, and to provide public health, scientists and medical professionals with tools to combat the pandemic. We\u2019ve launched more than 200 new products, features and initiatives \u2014 including the Exposure Notification API to assist contact tracing \u2014 and have pledged over $1 billion to assist our users, customers and partners around the world.\u00a0Today, when people search on Google for information for COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, we present them with a list of authorized vaccines in their location, with information on each individual vaccine from the FDA or CDC, as relevant. We also provide them with information about vaccination locations near them in Google Search and Google Maps, when that information is available. On YouTube, we launched COVID-19 information panels directing viewers to the CDC\u2019s information about the virus and, later on, about vaccines. These information panels are featured on the YouTube homepage, and on videos and in search results about the pandemic. Since March 2020, they have been viewed over 400 billion times. And we continue to work with YouTube creators to pair them with health experts who can get the facts to a wide range of audiences \u2014 we promote this content in our \u201cask the experts\u201d feature.Another way we\u2019ve been helping is by offering over $350 million in Ad Grants to help more than 100 government agencies and non-profit organizations around the world run critical public service announcements (PSAs) about COVID-19. Grantees can use these funds throughout 2021 for things like vaccine education and outreach campaigns.\u00a0[Editor's note: Reflected in Sundar's oral testimony, we have since updated the number to include Ad Grants provided to COVID-related recovery organizations globally, bringing the total from $350 million to $550 million.]In parallel to our efforts to elevate authoritative information about the pandemic and vaccines, we have worked across our services to combat harmful misinformation about these topics. Across our products, we\u2019ve had long-standing policies prohibiting harmful and misleading medical or health-related content. When COVID-19 hit, our Trust and Safety team worked to stop a variety of abuses stemming from the pandemic, including phishing attempts, malware, dangerous conspiracy theories, and fraud schemes. We took quick action to remove content that promoted inaccurate or misleading claims about cures, masks, and vaccines; our teams have removed 850,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information, and in total, we blocked nearly 100 million COVID-related ads throughout 2020. Our teams have also been planning for new threats and abuse patterns related specifically to COVID-19 vaccines. For example, in October, we expanded our COVID-19 medical misinformation policy on YouTube to remove content about vaccines that contradicts consensus from health authorities, such as the Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization (WHO).\u00a0\nDeveloping clear and transparent policiesWe were able to act quickly and decisively because of the significant investments we have made over years, not only to make information useful and accessible, but also to remove and reduce the spread of harmful misinformation. Across all of this work, we strive to have clear and transparent policies and enforce them without regard to political party or point of view. We work to raise up authoritative sources, and reduce the spread of misinformation in recommendations and elsewhere. Teams across the company work in a variety of roles to help develop and enforce our policies, monitor our platforms for abuse, and protect users from everything from account hijackings and disinformation campaigns to misleading content and inauthentic activity. And we don\u2019t do this work alone; we work closely with experts to stay ahead of emerging threats.\nSupporting innovation in journalism and the development of new business modelsAt Google, we believe that a vibrant news industry is vital to tackling misinformation on a societal scale. We invested millions to support COVID-19 related fact checking initiatives, providing training or resources to nearly 10,000 journalists. In addition to helping journalists tackle misinformation, we have long been committed to supporting newsrooms and journalists in the United States and abroad. Over the past 20 years, we have collaborated closely with the news industry and provided billions of dollars to support the creation of quality journalism in the digital age.\u00a0We share a strong interest in supporting a diverse and sustainable ecosystem of quality news providers. Our products are designed to elevate high quality journalism and connect consumers to diverse news sites \u2014 from global media companies to smaller digital startups.\u00a0We are proud that our services help people all over the world find relevant, authoritative news about issues that matter to them. Each month, people click through from Google Search and Google News results to publishers' websites more than 24 billion times \u2014 that\u2019s over 9,000 clicks per second. This free traffic helps new publishers increase their readership, build trust with readers and earn money through advertising and subscriptions. We also recently announced a new investment in Google News Showcase and committed $1 billion over the next three years to pay publishers to produce editorially curated content experiences and for limited free user access to paywalled content. In less than one year, we have been able to partner with over 500 publications across more than a dozen countries, spanning global, national, regional, metro and local publications.Our commitment to the future of news extends beyond our products and services. We launched the Google News Initiative to support journalistic innovation and the emergence of new business models. Since 2018, we have committed $61 million in funding to support more than 2,000 news partners across the United States and Canada. As part of this initiative, we have also helped more than 447,200 journalists develop knowledge and skills in digital journalism through in person and online trainings through the Google News Lab. And when the pandemic hit, we turned our resources to support local news organizations and fact-checkers \u2014 contributing $10.6 million to over 1,800 local newsrooms across the U.S. and Canada through our Journalism Emergency Relief Fund and committing $6.5 million to combat Covid-19 misinformation. We look forward to continuing this work with our partners in the news industry to ensure a thriving and healthy future for journalism.\nThe role of Section 230 in fighting misinformationThese are just some of the tangible steps we\u2019ve taken to support high-quality journalism and protect our users online, while preserving people\u2019s right to express themselves freely. Our ability to provide access to a wide range of information and viewpoints, while also being able to remove harmful content like misinformation, is made possible because of legal frameworks like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\u00a0Section 230 is foundational to the open web: It allows platforms and websites, big and small, across the entire internet, to responsibly manage content to keep users safe and promote access to information and free expression. Without Section 230, platforms would either over-filter content or not be able to filter content at all. In the fight against misinformation, Section 230 allows companies to take decisive action on harmful misinformation and keep up with bad actors who work hard to circumvent their policies.Thanks to Section 230, consumers and businesses of all kinds benefit from unprecedented access to information and a vibrant digital economy. Today, more people have the opportunity to create content, start a business online, and have a voice than ever before. At the same time, it is clear that there is so much more work to be done to address harmful content and behavior, both online and offline.Regulation has an important role to play in ensuring that we protect what is great about the open web, while addressing harm and improving accountability. We are, however, concerned that many recent proposals to change Section 230 \u2014 including calls to repeal it altogether \u2014 would not serve that objective well. In fact, they would have unintended consequences \u2014 harming both free expression and the ability of platforms to take responsible action to protect users in the face of constantly evolving challenges.\u00a0We might better achieve our shared objectives by focusing on ensuring transparent, fair, and effective processes for addressing harmful content and behavior. Solutions might include developing content policies that are clear and accessible, notifying people when their content is removed and giving them ways to appeal content decisions, and sharing how systems designed for addressing harmful content are working over time. With this in mind, we are committed not only to doing our part on our services, but also to improving transparency across our industry.I look forward to sharing more about our approach with you today, and working together to create a path forward for the web\u2019s next three decades.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

(That investigation looked at search design, similar to the case filed last year by various state attorneys general.) In response to recent speculation in the press about the FTC\u2019s decision, we wanted to set the record straight.In a unanimous, bipartisan decision, all five FTC Commissioners concluded that the evolution of Google Search was designed to \u201cimprove the quality\u201d of search results and \u201clikely benefited consumers.\u201dNow, the staff papers and memos that helped inform this decision have been made public.\u00a0These documents show why, after a comprehensive review, the Federal Trade Commissioners all voted to close their investigation nearly a decade ago. The memos conclusively confirm that the decision to not bring an antitrust case against the design of Google\u2019s search engine was supported by clear and unambiguous recommendations by all sections of the FTC who reviewed it, including the Bureau of Competition, the Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Bureau of Economics and the Office of the General Counsel.\u00a0It\u2019s also clear from the papers how actively Microsoft and other rivals were encouraging these complaints. The FTC put consumers' interests in higher-quality search results over the interests of a powerful commercial rival, which has since grown even further, to become the second-biggest company in the U.S. by market capitalization.\u00a0\u00a0The memos also show that the FTC and its staff looked in detail at our Android and Apple distribution agreements (the subject of the Department of Justice\u2019s current case) and, after uncovering evidence that people can readily choose alternatives but \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d prefer Google, declined to challenge them.Some highlights:\nPeople choose to use Google.One click away: \u201cThe argument that competition is just \u2018one click away\u2019 is a compelling one.\u201d (Bureau of Competition staff memo)Users prefer Google: \u201cLike the wireless carriers, Apple states [Google] is the overwhelming preference of its customers.\u201d (Bureau of Competition staff memo)Partners prefer Google: \u201cThe companies have made it apparent to Staff that they have no interest in being released from their current contracts, and little interest in pursuing negotiations with alternative search providers.\u201d (Bureau of Competition staff memo)\nGoogle Search benefits users.Universal Search was indisputably a product improvement: \u201cFirst, I endorse the staff\u2019s recommendation not to bring a case on search preferencing. To bring such a case would intrude deeply into product design, an area into which courts have been extremely reluctant to go unless the design feature in question has no legitimate justification. \u2026 Universal Search was indisputably a product improvement\u2026\u201d (General Counsel memo)Universal Search benefits users: \u201cGoogle's documents show that Universal Search was a procompetitive response to pressure from vertical sites and general search sites and an improvement for users.\u201d (Bureau of Economics staff memo)Substantial benefit for users: \u201cUniversal Search is a \u2018product improvement\u2019 that has resulted in substantial benefit to its users...Google's organization and aggregation of content from other websites adds value to the product for consumers.\u201d (Bureau of Competition staff memo)Google\u2019s search practices benefit users: \u201cGoogle can legitimately claim that at least part of the conduct at issue improves its product and benefits users.\u201d (Bureau of Competition staff memo)\nGoogle\u2019s distribution agreementsOur search distribution agreements with web browsers, like Apple\u2019s Safari browser, aren\u2019t exclusive: \u201c[W]e find strong reasons for doubting that ... default status on web browsers (both desktop and mobile) can be properly viewed as \u2018exclusives\u2019 in the sense that users are unable, with relatively low cost, to access rival search engines.\u201d (Bureau of Economics staff memo)\u00a0Our Android agreements aren\u2019t exclusive: \u201cAs an initial matter, recall that Google\u2019s agreements with smartphone manufacturers do not actually require exclusivity. Rather, they are contracts that require Google search to be the initially installed default search engine. Consumers are free to switch to other search engines, or even to replace Google as their default search engine, should they wish to do so.\u201d (Bureau of Economics staff memo)\nGoogle faces competition from specialized search engines.Search and vertical search compete: \u201c[S]ubstantial documentary evidence that Google competes against specialized search engines for certain types of queries. Google's competition with specialized search engines is similar to a supermarket's competition with a convenience store.\u201d (Lead staff economists)\nGoogle\u2019s Apple agreementLead staff economists on the Google investigation:Apple chooses Google because it\u2019s the \u201cbest\u201d: \u201cApple stated... \u2018Apple's focus is offering its customers the best products out of the box while allowing them to make choices after purchase. In many countries, Google offers the best product or service.\u2019\u201d\u00a0The agreement is not exclusive: \u201cAdditionally, similar to the desktop Safari agreement, both Microsoft and Yahoo are preloaded alternatives to Google in mobile Safari. According to Apple, to change the default, go to \"Settings> Safari > Search Engine.\"Switching search engines is trivial: \"[C]hanging the default search option on mobile browsers involves a few taps and downloading other search apps can be achieved in a few seconds. These are trivial switching costs.\"\nOverall conclusionNo antitrust violation: \u201c[I]n my judgment at least, the weight of the available evidence...indicates that Google's conduct has not risen to the level of an antitrust violation.\u201d (Deputy Director in the Bureau of Economics)Consensus: \u201cI agree with both [Bureau of Competition] and [Bureau of Economics] staff recommendations that the Commission not issue a complaint or pursue remedies for discriminatory \u2018search preferencing\u2019 by Google.\u201d (Head of the Bureau of Economics)Staff raise doubts about the case: \u201cWe have identified throughout this memorandum the many substantial risks associated with bringing a case against Google. On a global level, the record will permit Google to show substantial innovation, intense competition from Microsoft and others, and speculative long-run harm.\u201c (Bureau of Competition staff memo)\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Not surprisingly, success hasn\u2019t come quickly. This isn\u2019t an easy task \u2014 but it remains a critical one. As the world economy seeks to recover from the global pandemic and governments face new fiscal pressures, an agreed solution is needed now more than ever to ensure a durable framework for cross-border trade and investment.\nTomorrow\u2019s meeting of G20 finance ministers represents an important opportunity to give this process new momentum. For the new Biden Administration, the meeting represents a chance to underscore its commitment to the OECD-led multilateral process and to fair, comprehensive, and coordinated changes to corporate tax policies. And it represents an equally important opportunity for finance ministers from France, the UK, India, Indonesia, and other leading economies to commit to end the headlong rush to discriminatory tax measures that we\u2019ve seen in recent years and work with the U.S. on a durable agreement. \nThe central question is less about how much corporate income tax companies pay than where they pay it. For Google\u2019s part, our effective tax rate over the past decade has exceeded 20% of our profits, in line with average statutory tax rates. While we\u2019re one of the largest corporate taxpayers in the world, roughly 80% of our corporate income tax has been due in the United States, where Google was founded and where most of our products are developed. The concentration of our tax obligations in our home market mirrors many other multinational companies spanning various industries and countries; foreign firms operating in the U.S. and other countries, for example, also pay the majority of their corporate income taxes in their home countries.\nThese tax practices are the product of international rules \u2014 specifically, international tax treaties that historically have attributed a smaller share of profits to the countries where products and services are consumed, leaving the bulk of taxing rights to the countries where products and services are created.\nWe have long supported efforts to update international tax rules to arrive at a system where more taxing rights are shifted to countries where products and services are consumed. So, U.S. exports, including a range of technologies, might incur more income tax abroad, while foreign companies exporting to the U.S. would pay more to the U.S. public purse. Like any good agreement, this will require a healthy amount of give-and-take.\nUnfortunately, in the absence of multilateral consensus, the world has seen the growth in recent years of taxes targeted at foreign companies. Most prominently, we have seen the growth of so-called \u201cdigital services taxes\u201d that aim to raise revenue from a small subset of firms, narrowly defined by revenue thresholds and business models. This selective approach has sparked tensions between the U.S. and some of its allies, pushing countries toward trade disputes that could further damage fragile economies.\nSome of the countries imposing these targeted taxes claim they help build momentum for broader international tax reform. But these digital services taxes are complicating efforts to reach a balanced agreement that works for all countries \u2013 they\u2019re simply laying claim to income that would otherwise be taxed in the U.S. We encourage these governments to roll back what are essentially tariffs or, at a minimum, suspend them while negotiations continue.\nThe next few months will test commitments countries have made to reinvigorate international cooperation. Left on the current trajectory, tax discord could quickly yield beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism that would weaken cooperation on many issues. But serious steps forward \u2014 starting with the rescission or suspension of existing unilateral taxes \u2014 could create new momentum for multilateralism, supporting collaboration on many other important fronts. We urge countries to work together on this critical project, building a firmer foundation for international cooperation in the 21st century.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

When it comes to the content on our platforms, we have a responsibility to safeguard the people and businesses using our products, and to do so with clear, transparent policies and processes. \nToday, we\u2019re announcing our second Google Safety Engineering Center (GSEC)\u2014and our first focused on content responsibility\u2014to be located in our European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Our first GSEC opened in Munich in 2019 and builds tools to protect users\u2019 privacy and security. The new Dublin center will be a regional hub for Google experts working to tackle the spread of illegal and harmful content and a place where we can share this work with policymakers, researchers, and regulators.\nDublin is already a hub for our Trust and Safety teams in the region, comprising many different policy experts, specialists and engineers working to keep people safe online by using the latest technology and artificial intelligence. Europe has been leading many different safety efforts globally, and is home to teams working on everything from ad transparency and child safety to botnet research and violent extremism.\nThe new GSEC will provide additional transparency into this work and make it easier for\u00a0 regulators, policymakers and researchers to gain a hands-on understanding of how we deal with content safety. It will also help everyone understand how we develop and enforce policies, how our anti-abuse technologies and early threat detection systems work, how we work with trusted flaggers, as well as our incident management processes and content moderation practices. Specifically: \nRegulators: Through GSEC, regulators will be able to access more information about how our content moderation systems and other technologies work in practice, in a secure location that safeguards the confidentiality of user information. When fully operational, this will enable regulators and policymakers (under existing or upcoming legal frameworks like the Digital Services Act) to conduct inquiries, evaluate processes and engage in official fact finding. \nAcademics: GSEC Dublin will work with the wider academic community and civil society groups promoting safety online. This new center will enable us to engage more closely with researchers, NGOs and other external stakeholders about emerging trends and risks with the aim of improving safety for people online. This work will be done with the appropriate safeguards on confidentiality, user privacy and security. With the announcement of GSEC Dublin we\u2019re also announcing our first partnership with the Irish Research Council funding academic scholarship and research into online safety.\nCivil society: GSEC will build on existing initiatives within Google that bring to life our responsible-by-design approach. We will share this knowledge more widely through the publication of reports and insights on content responsibility. This work is already underway, and we recently published our white paper on content moderation and information quality.\nOur Trust and Safety teams sit around the globe, and we have more than 20,000 people working in a variety of roles to help enforce our policies and moderate content. We also continue to invest in initiatives like transparency reports, proactive disclosures around coordinated influence operations and disinformation, as well as sharing information with researchers and supporting collaborations like Project Lumen to help users, academics and policymakers better understand how we manage content at scale. \nWe have a responsibility to keep people safe online and to protect our platforms and products from abuse. As we continue to invest and scale these efforts, we are committed to providing additional transparency into our processes and policies. The work of the GSEC for Content Responsibility will begin virtually, and we plan to open the physical center in Dublin as soon as it is safe to do so and COVID-19 restrictions allow. \nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

We look forward to showing in court why AG Paxton\u2019s allegations are wrong. But given some of the misleading claims that have been circulating\u2014in particular, the inaccurate portrayal of our well-publicized \u201cOpen Bidding\u201d agreement with Facebook\u2014we wanted to set the record straight.\u00a0\u00a0\nAbout our ad services\u00a0Ad tech helps websites and apps make money and fund high-quality content. It also helps our advertising partners\u2014most of whom are small merchants\u2014reach customers and grow their businesses.\u00a0\u00a0AG Paxton tries to paint Google\u2019s involvement in this industry as nefarious. The opposite is true. Unlike some B2B companies in this space, a consumer internet company like Google has an incentive to maintain a positive user experience and a sustainable internet that works for all\u2014consumers, advertisers and publishers.For example, as we\u2019ve built our ad tech products, we have given people granular controls over how their information is used to personalize ads and limited the sharing of personal data to safeguard people\u2019s privacy. We\u2019ve invested in detecting and blocking harmful ads that violate our policies. We also build tools that load content and ads faster; block scammy ad experiences like pop-ups; and reduce the number of intrusive, annoying ads through innovations like skippable ads. Those tools not only help people, but by building trust, promote the sustainability of the free and open internet.\u00a0We\u2019ve worked to be open and upfront with the industry about the improvements we make to our technologies. We try to do the right thing as we balance the concerns of publishers, advertisers, and the people who use our services. Our ad tech rivals and large partners may not always like every decision we make\u2014we\u2019re never going to be able to please everybody. But that\u2019s hardly evidence of wrongdoing and certainly not a credible basis for an antitrust lawsuit.Here are just a few of the things AG Paxton\u2019s complaint gets wrong:\nMyth: Google \u201cdominates the online advertising landscape for image-based web display ads.\u201dFact: The ad tech industry is incredibly crowded and competitive.Competition in online advertising has made ads more affordable and relevant, reduced ad tech fees, and expanded options for publishers and advertisers.The online advertising space is famously crowded. We compete with household names like Adobe, Amazon, AT&T, Comcast, Facebook, Oracle, Twitter and Verizon. Facebook, for example, is the largest seller of display ads and Amazon last month surpassed us as the preferred ad buying platform for advertisers. We compete fiercely with those companies and others such as Mediaocean, Amobee, MediaMath, Centro, Magnite, The Trade Desk, Index Exchange, OpenX, PubMatic and countless more. A growing number of retail brands such as Walmart, Walgreens, Best Buy, Kroger and Target are also offering their own ad tech.Myth: Google \u201cextracts a very high ... percent of the ad dollars otherwise flowing to online publishers.\u201dFact: Our fees are actually lower than reported industry averages.Our ad tech fees are lower than reported industry averages. Publishers keep about 70 percent of the revenue when using our products, and for some types of advertising, publishers keep even more\u2014that\u2019s more money in publishers\u2019 pockets to fund their creation of high-quality content.Myth: We created an alternative to header bidding that \u201csecretly stacks the deck in Google\u2019s favor.\u201dFact: We created Open Bidding to address the drawbacks of header bidding.Header bidding refers to running an auction among multiple ad exchanges for given ad space. You won\u2019t read this in AG Paxton\u2019s complaint, but the technology has real drawbacks: Header bidding auctions take place within the browser, on your computer or mobile phone, so they require the device to use more data in order to work. This can lead to problems like webpages taking longer to load and device batteries draining faster. And the multilayered complexity of header bidding can lead to fraud and other problems that can artificially increase prices for advertisers, as well as billing discrepancies that can hurt publisher revenue.So we created an alternative to header bidding, called Open Bidding, which runs within the ad server instead of on your device. This solves many of the problems associated with header bidding. Open Bidding provides publishers access to demand from dozens of networks and exchanges. This helps increase demand for publisher inventory and competition for ad space, which enables publishers to drive more revenue. In fact, our data shows that publishers who decide to use Open Bidding on Ad Manager typically see double-digit revenue increases across our partners and exchange\u2014and they can measure this for themselves.\u00a0Additionally, our publisher platform has always integrated with header bidding, so publishers have the choice to use their preferred bidding solution. Publishers can and do bring bids from non-Google header bidding tools into our platform.Since we launched Open Bidding, traditional header bidding has continued to grow. In fact, a recent survey shows about 90 percent of publishers currently use header bidding for desktop and 60 percent use header bidding for mobile in-app or in-stream video. Amazon also launched an entirely new competitive header bidding solution, which uses the same server-side approach that we do. Header bidding is an evolving and growing space\u2014and now, as a result of our work, there are alternatives to header bidding that improve the user experience.Myth: Our Open Bidding agreement with Facebook harms publishers.Fact: Facebook is one of over 25 partners in Open Bidding, and their participation actually helps publishers.AG Paxton also makes misleading claims about Facebook\u2019s participation in our Open Bidding program.\u00a0 Facebook Audience Network (FAN)\u2019s involvement isn\u2019t a secret. In fact, it was well-publicized and FAN is one of over 25 partners participating in Open Bidding. Our agreement with FAN simply enables them (and the advertisers they represent) to participate in Open Bidding. Of course we want FAN to participate because the whole goal of Open Bidding is to work with a range of ad networks and exchanges to increase demand for publishers\u2019 ad space, which helps those publishers earn more revenue. FAN\u2019s participation helps that. But to be clear, Open Bidding is still an extremely small part of our ad tech business, accounting for less than 4 percent of the display ads we place.AG Paxton inaccurately claims that we manipulate the Open Bidding auction in FAN\u2019s favor. We absolutely don\u2019t. FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression. If another eligible network or exchange bids higher, they win the auction. FAN\u2019s participation in Open Bidding doesn't prevent Facebook from participating in header bidding or any other similar system. In fact, FAN participates in several similar auctions on rival platforms.And AG Paxton\u2019s claims about how much we charge other Open Bidding partners are mistaken\u2014our standard revenue share for Open Bidding is 5-10 percent.Myth: AMP was designed to hurt header bidding.Fact: AMP was designed in partnership with publishers to improve the mobile web.AG Paxton\u2019s claims about AMP and header bidding are just false. Engineers at Google designed AMP in partnership with publishers and other tech companies to help webpages load faster and improve the user experience on mobile devices\u2014not to harm header bidding.AMP supports a range of monetization options, including header bidding. Publishers are free to use both AMP and header bidding technologies together if they choose. The use of header bidding doesn\u2019t factor into publisher search rankings.\u00a0Myth: We force partners to use Google tools.Fact: Partners can readily use our tools and other technologies side by side.\u00a0This claim isn\u2019t accurate either. Publishers and advertisers often use multiple technologies simultaneously. In fact, surveys show the average large publisher uses six different platforms to sell ads on its site, and plans to use even more this year. And the top 100 advertisers use an average of four or more platforms to buy ads.All of this is why we build our technologies to be interoperable with more than 700 rival platforms for advertisers and 80 rival platforms for publishers.AG Paxton\u2019s complaint talks about the idea that we offer tools for both advertisers and publishers as if that\u2019s unusual or problematic. But that reflects a lack of knowledge of the online ads industry, where serving both advertisers and publishers is actually commonplace. Many firms with competing ad tech businesses, such as AT&T, Amazon, Twitter, Verizon, Comcast and others, offer ad platforms and tools like ours that cater to both advertisers and publishers. We don\u2019t require either advertisers or publishers to use our whole \u201cstack,\u201d and many don\u2019t. Ultimately, advertisers and publishers can choose what works best for their needs.Myth: \u201cGoogle uses privacy concerns to advantage itself.\u201dFact: Consumers expect us to secure their data\u2014and we do.AG Paxton misrepresents our privacy initiatives. We're committed to operating our advertising business in a way that gives people transparency into and control over how their data is used. Consumers also increasingly expect, and data privacy laws require, strict controls over ad tracking tools like cookies and ad identifiers. So we\u2019re focused on meeting those expectations and requirements. As we do so, we\u2019ve created privacy-protecting solutions that enable other ad tech companies to continue to operate and introduced an open and collaborative industry initiative called the Privacy Sandbox, which is working on alternatives to cookies that preserve privacy while protecting free content. Other web browsers have likewise taken similar steps to limit the use of cookies and protect user privacy.Myth: Google forecloses competition by using exclusive access to historic bid information to win auctions.\u00a0Fact: Google Ads bidding technology does not have exclusive access to historic bid information from the Google Ad Exchange.\u00a0AG Paxton mischaracterizes one of many improvements Google Ads has made to optimize advertiser bids. This was entirely implemented by Google Ads for buyers, using the kinds of data and strategies that are available to any buyer participating in an Ad Exchange auction. Like many other businesses, we constantly work to improve our products and compete more effectively. That's the kind of behavior that increases competition and makes ads more effective for businesses large and small.\nMore informationThere are many other things this complaint simply gets wrong. You can read more about our ad tech business by visiting our competition website.We look forward to defending ourselves in court. In the meantime, we\u2019ll continue our work to help publishers and advertisers grow with digital ads and create a sustainable advertising industry that supports free content for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

This was established in 2012 and allows \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the United States as children to request deferred action and work authorization for a renewal period of two years. Google proudly employs Dreamers who work to build the products you use every day. And we\u2019ve defended their right to stay in the United States by joining amici briefs in court supporting DACA.\nUnfortunately, DACA\u2019s immediate future is uncertain. At the end of 2020, a U.S. District Court indicated that it could soon issue a ruling against DACA and bar new applications and ultimately renewals as well, leaving countless Dreamers in limbo during this uncertain time.\nWe believe it\u2019s important that Dreamers have a chance to apply for protection under the program so that they can safeguard their status in the United States. But in the middle of a global pandemic that has led to economic hardship,\u00a0especially for the many immigrants playing essential roles on the front lines,\u00a0there is concern that many Dreamers cannot afford to pay the application fee.\nWe want to do our part, so Google.org is making a $250,000 grant to United We Dream to cover the DACA application fees of over 500 Dreamers. This grant builds on over $35 million in support that Google.org and Google employees have contributed over the years to support immigrants and refugees worldwide, including more than $1 million from Googlers and Google.org specifically supporting DACA and domestic immigration efforts through employee giving campaigns led by HOLA (Google\u2019s Latino Employee Resource Group).\nWe know this is only a temporary solution. We need legislation that not only protects Dreamers, but also delivers other much-needed reforms.

We know that if you don\u2019t like the results we\u2019re giving you, you have numerous alternatives\u2014including Amazon, Expedia, Tripadvisor and many others just a click away.So we keep working to improve our results, designing and rolling out helpful features in Search\u2014including maps, links to products and services you can buy directly, flight and hotel options, and local business information like hours of operation and delivery services.Look at how our search results have evolved and improved over the years. This is what our search results looked like in 2000\u201410 blue links, but no other useful features:\nAnd this is what they look like today\u2014more useful information, more direct connections to businesses, more links to websites. Our rigorous testing tells us that you far prefer these types of rich results.\nOther search engines like Microsoft\u2019s Bing seem to have heard the same feedback because they have also evolved to provide these kinds of direct results.\nTo get more specifically to the issues raised in today\u2019s lawsuit: it suggests we shouldn't have worked to make Search better and that we should, in fact, be less useful to you. When you search for local products and services, we show information that helps you connect with businesses directly and helps them reach more customers. This lawsuit demands changes to the design of Google Search, requiring us to prominently feature online middlemen in place of direct connections to businesses.\u00a0 \u00a0Redesigning Google Search this way would harm the quality of your search results. And it would come at the expense of businesses like retailers, restaurants, repair shops, airlines and hotels whose listings in Google help them get discovered, and connect directly with customers. They would have a harder time reaching new customers and competing against big commerce and travel platforms and other aggregators and middlemen.\u00a0The data shows that our local results in Search drive more than 4 billion direct connections for businesses every month (such as visits to businesses\u2019 websites, people calling merchants, getting directions to stores, ordering food from restaurants).\u00a0Even as we have added content and features to our search results, the volume of traffic we send to non-Google sites has increased every year since Search was created. Our search results page, which used to show 10 links, now shows an average of 26 outgoing links on mobile devices.\u00a0\nThe claims being made have been closely examined and rejected by regulators and courts around the world, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, competition authorities in Brazil, Canada and Taiwan, and courts in the United Kingdom and Germany, who all agreed that our changes are designed to improve your search results. It\u2019s also well established that the most important driver for our search results is the specific query\u2014not your personal data.\nWe know that scrutiny of big companies is important and we\u2019re prepared to answer questions and work through the issues. But this lawsuit seeks to redesign Search in ways that would deprive Americans of helpful information and hurt businesses\u2019 ability to connect directly with customers. We look forward to making that case in court, while remaining focused on delivering a high-quality search experience for our users.\u00a0The lawsuit also contains allegations that have previously been made about how we distribute Search, and about our advertising technologies.

They support great content and services from a diverse range of creators and publishers. They help companies of all sizes reach customers more efficiently than ever before.\u00a0Yet people\u2019s expectations for the collection and use of data are changing, which means the web as we know it\u2014free, open and ad-supported\u2014is changing, too. Internet platforms, web browsers and ad-blocking features are promising more privacy by blocking common technologies like cookies. This takes a toll on the funds that content creators, newsrooms, web developers and videographers depend on to support their work. It also means that companies that rely on these technologies must respect the demand for a more private web in order for the web itself to remain dynamic and vibrant over the long term.\u00a0We strongly believe that advertising and privacy can coexist. Helping businesses adapt to a privacy-safe web isn\u2019t just good business practice\u2014if done right, and done collaboratively, it can be an engine for economic recovery and growth.The importance of online advertising\u00a0When you see ads online, they\u2019re usually placed with the support of widely available tools, often called ad technology or \u201cad tech,\u201d that help companies get the most out of the money they spend on ads. Google competes with a range of companies large and small to provide these tools to the platforms, publishers, and advertisers that need them.\u00a0All this competition drives us to innovate and improve our tools. Millions of publishers use Google advertising services to help make the digital advertising process easy and effective, and publishers retain about 70 percent of the revenue that\u2019s generated (and for many, it\u2019s even more). We\u2019re constantly working to help them earn more: In 2019, we made nearly 80 product improvements aimed at improving publisher revenue, which generated revenue increases of more than 9 percent in total for publishers using Google Ad Manager.What cookies do\u00a0Much of online advertising makes use of a basic, widely available technology called cookies, which are part of the basic architecture of the web. They help with things like measuring the effectiveness of a company\u2019s ad campaign or enabling a particular advertiser to reach the consumers it wants to reach.However, cookies were conceived for an earlier era. It\u2019s clear from privacy laws in Europe and around the world that citizens and governments want a greater understanding of how they work and more control over their use. And efforts by platforms, browsers and ad-blocking companies are already putting new limits on them.In this changing landscape, the funds that web publishers rely on to support their operations are increasingly at risk. For example, an analysis of the 500 largest Google Ad Manager customers found that when third-party cookies are disabled, publishers receive on average 52 percent less programmatic ad revenue. Like others, Google also uses third-party cookies for ads we serve on other sites (for example, Google Ad Manager and AdSense) so Google will also be affected as the industry moves away from cookies.The Privacy Sandbox\u00a0The question today is whether the web can keep people\u2019s information safe and private while also supporting the advertising that keeps so much of the web free.\u00a0That\u2019s why, as part of a larger initiative with the web standards community called the \u201cPrivacy Sandbox,\u201d the engineers behind Google\u2019s browser, Chrome, are working on ways to underpin a healthy, ad-supported web without third-party cookies. Privacy Sandbox aims to provide space for experimentation and input from technologists, businesses, publishers, regulators and more. Among the proposals being tested are privacy-safe ways to do things like predict and protect against fraud, properly measure if an ad campaign has \u201cworked,\u201d and find the right audience for an ad. One such proposal, Federated Learning of Cohorts, uses machine learning algorithms that run on individual devices to model groups of people by their browsing behaviors without creating individual ad profiles at all.Coming up with these new technologies involves complicated trade-offs, but we believe that the decision to phase out support for third-party cookies is the right thing for privacy and the industry as a whole. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working with the industry in forums like the W3C, and are in active discussions with independent authorities, such as the Competition and Markets Authority and the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the UK, to help us find the best approach.\u00a0Responsible use of dataWe\u2019re committed to having privacy-preserving mechanisms in place that address the industry\u2019s critical needs before discontinuing support for third-party cookies. We think this will not only promote business growth for numerous companies, but could also increase competition in the sector overall by making it a healthier place to advertise and grow while still meeting consumers\u2019 expectations.Alongside our efforts to promote privacy, we\u2019re increasing transparency on the data we use, and are investing in products to help people and businesses to understand, protect, move and benefit from data in new ways.\u00a0Protecting people's personal data doesn\u2019t have to be at odds with business growth. By focusing on the people who use our products and investing in new technologies to connect advertisers and publishers with users safely, we can create more value and promote a thriving future on the web\u2014for everyone.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nAds\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

In many cases, they\u2019re struggling to manage the pandemic with fewer public health resources and also suffer from greater economic vulnerabilities. Yet emerging markets also have some of the most vibrant economies and greatest entrepreneurial energy in the world. With the right policy frameworks, they can become ideal launching pads for future innovation. This challenging moment may be exactly the right time for these economies to pursue ambitious digital transformation, using their immediate recovery efforts to develop sustainable economic gains.\u00a0Nearly a third of U.S. small business owners are using digital tools to save their business during the COVID-19 crisis. In emerging markets too, digital technologies are often providing a lifeline: a plus-size clothes designer in Manaus, Brazil, a musical instruments maker in Istanbul, Turkey and an owner of a guest house in Durban, South Africa have all been able to survive by using digital technologies and online commerce.\nBecoming \u201cDigital Sprinters\u201dWe call these emerging economies \u201cDigital Sprinters\u201d because, by becoming more digital, they have the potential to sprint ahead toward economic development. Based on our experiences, we believe governments and the private sector should focus on four key areas, as detailed in a report we're releasing today:\nPhysical capital: this is about digital connectivity and infrastructure. It\u2019s not just about investment but also how infrastructure is managed.Human capital: countries need a comprehensive approach to worker training, economic security, entrepreneurship, and combating discrimination.Technology: increasing the use of data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, which empower the growth of next-generation technologies and unlock future growth. This means new opportunities alongside new questions about how best to harness these technologies.Competitiveness: policies that promote competitive and open markets, interoperable regulatory standards, and tax regimes that are predictable and based on international standards.Our recommendations reflect just one perspective on public policy frameworks for digital transformation. We hope that the report will help advance conversations about digitally-driven growth among governments, civil society, international organizations, academic institutions and entrepreneurs.\nPotential economic gainsThe economic potential from digital transformation is huge. A new study finds that, by 2030, digital transformation could generate as much $3.4 trillion of economic value in these Digital Sprinter markets. At a country level this translates to 25 percent of GDP in Brazil, 31 percent in Saudi Arabia and 33 percent in Nigeria, to name a few examples.Emerging markets face a watershed moment today. As COVID-19 is disrupting world order and breaking supply chains, emerging markets have an opportunity to transform and emerge as stronger players. We hope these reports published today can play a part in helping decision-makers take advantage of these opportunities.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nNext Billion Users\n  \nNext Billion Users\n  "}

Read our CEO Sundar Pichai\u2019s opening testimony below, describing how Section 230 makes it possible for Google to provide access to a wide range of information\u2014including high-quality local journalism\u2014while responsibly protecting people from harm and keeping their information private.Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Cantwell, and distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.The internet has been a powerful force for good over the past three decades. It has radically improved access to information, whether it\u2019s connecting Americans to jobs, getting critical updates to people in times of crisis, or helping a parent find answers to questions like \u201cHow can I get my baby to sleep through the night?\u201dAt the same time, people everywhere can use their voices to share new perspectives, express themselves and reach broader audiences than ever before. Whether you\u2019re a barber in Mississippi or a home renovator in Indiana, you can share a video and build a global fanbase\u2014and a successful business\u2014right from your living room.In this way, the internet has been one of the world\u2019s most important equalizers. Information can be shared\u2014and knowledge can flow\u2014from anyone, to anywhere. But the same low barriers to entry also make it possible for bad actors to cause harm.As a company whose mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, Google is deeply conscious of both the opportunities and risks the internet creates.\u00a0I\u2019m proud that Google\u2019s information services like Search, Gmail, Maps, and Photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American\u2014for free. We feel a deep responsibility to keep the people who use our products safe and secure, and have long invested in innovative tools to prevent abuse of our services.\u00a0When it comes to privacy we are committed to keeping your information safe, treating it responsibly, and putting you in control. We continue to make privacy improvements \u2014like the changes I announced earlier this year to keep less data by default\u2014and support the creation of comprehensive federal privacy laws.We are equally committed to protecting the quality and integrity of information on our platforms, and supporting our democracy in a non-partisan way.As just one timely example, our information panels on Google and YouTube inform users about where to vote and how to register. We\u2019ve also taken many steps to raise up high-quality journalism, from sending 24 billion visits to news websites globally every month, to our recent $1 billion investment in partnerships with news publishers.Since our founding, we have been deeply committed to the freedom of expression. We also feel a responsibility to protect people who use our products from harmful content and to be transparent about how we do that. That\u2019s why we set and publicly disclose clear guidelines for our products and platforms, which we enforce impartially.\u00a0We recognize that people come to our services with a broad spectrum of perspectives, and we are dedicated to building products that are helpful to users of all backgrounds and viewpoints.Let me be clear: We approach our work without political bias, full stop. To do otherwise would be contrary to both our business interests and our mission, which compels us to make information accessible to every type of person, no matter where they live or what they believe.Of course, our ability to provide access to a wide range of information is only possible because of existing legal frameworks, like Section 230. The United States adopted Section 230 early in the internet\u2019s history, and it has been foundational to U.S. leadership in the tech sector. It protects the freedom to create and share content while supporting the ability of platforms and services of all sizes to responsibly address harmful content.\u00a0 \u00a0We appreciate that this Committee has put great thought into how platforms should address content, and we look forward to having these conversations.\u00a0As you think about how to shape policy in this important area, I would urge the Committee to be very thoughtful about any changes to Section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and customers.At the end of the day, we all share the same goal: free access to information for everyone and responsible protections for people and their data. We support legal frameworks that achieve these goals, and I look forward to engaging with you today about these important issues, and answering your questions.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

For many of us, and for many businesses, digital tools have been a lifeline during lockdown, helping us work, shop, find customers, connect with loved ones and get the latest public health information.Helpful digital tools that serve millions of people don\u2019t happen by\u00a0accident\u2014they\u00a0need investment and rules that encourage that investment and innovation.\u00a0 Twenty years ago, the European Union created a regulatory environment to do just that. Now it's overhauling those rules, with a comprehensive reform called the Digital Services Act (DSA).\u00a0 We fully support updating the rules, and think it\u2019s more important than ever that this regulation delivers for European consumers and businesses.\u00a0But a significant part of this reform will impact how digital tools can be built in the future, and by whom. That\u2019s why, earlier this year, we shared our ideas with the European Commission, suggesting ways that existing legislation could be improved and warning of the risks if new rules are poorly designed.Through the pandemic, people\u2019s use of technology has jumped forward five years, with a 60 percent increase in internet usage. Searches for online shopping and how-to-buy online grew by 200\u00a0percent\u00a0worldwide. Demand for the free digital skills courses that Google offers has increased by 300\u00a0percent. And many businesses\u2014like restaurants, fashion designers, retailers and even hairdressers\u2014have embraced digital to survive during painful lockdowns and restrictions.\u00a0Now, just as in every economic downturn of the last 20 years, digital tools will be a vital catalyst for the economic recovery that must come after COVID-19. In rewriting the rules that govern the internet in Europe, the EU has an opportunity to rebuild the foundations so that everybody can thrive online and consumers can benefit from wide choice and lower prices.\u00a0Yet reports suggest that some of the proposals being considered would do the opposite.\u00a0 They would prevent global technology companies like Google from building innovative digital tools like the ones that people have used through lockdown\u2014and that will help European businesses rebuild their operations. That would be a missed opportunity for Europe as it looks to the post-Covid future.The DSA will not only affect a handful of global companies, but will also have broader impacts - including on the livelihoods of small business owners across Europe, who use digital services like ours to communicate with their customers, sell their products and services and fuel their growth.\u00a0To take just one example, if you use Google Search to look for\u00a0 \u201cThai food nearby,\u201d\u00a0\u2014Google Maps shows you where the nearest restaurant is located and provides its contact details. And other links let you book a table directly (if local health restrictions allow) or see if you can pick up your meal to take away.\u00a0The DSA could prevent Google from developing such user-centric features. That would clearly have an impact not just on how people use our services, but also on the thousands of restaurants which welcomed millions of diners in Europe using this free feature this year.\u00a0At Google, we put innovation and continuous improvement at the heart of everything we do.\u00a0 While we support the ambition of the DSA to create clear rules for the next 20 years that support economic growth, we worry that the new rules may instead slow economic recovery. We will advocate strongly for policies that will help ensure innovation and digital tools are at the heart of Europe's recovery and future success.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past few months, we\u2019ve seen the power of technology as a tool to bring people together, keep them safe and help them get through difficult times. Now, more than ever, we need to focus not on how to limit innovation by a few companies, but on how the full range of digital tools available can contribute to Europe\u2019s recovery and future economic success.

That makes it all the more critical that we and our partners in the region continue to address the serious challenge of online piracy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Google\u2019s overall approach is set out in our Anti-Piracy Principles, and we work closely with media and entertainment industry organizations to tackle new challenges. Two years ago, we started talking to the Asia Video Industry Association (AVIA), the trade group for the video ecosystem in Asia, about how we could collaborate. Since then, we\u2019ve been having quarterly forums with their members: broadcasters, operators and telcos. We also make sure AVIA members are aware of new features like What to Watch, to ensure their legitimate content is visible and prominent on the Search results page.To learn more about online piracy in Asia Pacific (APAC), we spoke to Louis Boswell, CEO of AVIA.\u00a0How does the APAC region differ from others when it comes to broadcast, media and\u00a0 entertainment?There are very divergent tastes in content across APAC, which is not surprising given the different cultures and languages. The genres that work best across multiple markets would be a mix of Western, Korean and Chinese content. These genres are widely available, but fragmented over many services, some not mature, and business models vary. In parts of the region, people have never developed a habit of paying for content, so platforms often feel they have to adapt their business models to compete with piracy in a far more pronounced way than in the West. In terms of consumption, many markets are mobile-first.What role should education play in efforts to fight piracy? Do consumers in the region know how to access legitimate alternatives and why they should choose these options?Consumer awareness is important to any anti-piracy strategy. Consumers need to know the very real risks they face from malware when accessing piracy sites or using illicit applications. Most people know that what they are accessing is stolen content: in a recent YouGov survey, commissioned by AVIA\u2019s Coalition Against Piracy (CAP), when asked who was most responsible for preventing piracy, Singaporeans chose \u201cthe individual, for choosing not to watch pirated content.\u201d There are many legal and reliable video streaming services available in Southeast Asia. Websites that are dedicated to infringement are unreliable, put people at risk of malware infection, and fund crime groups.\u00a0Over the last few years, Google has been a partner of AVIA\u2014working to fight piracy in the region. Why are these types of partnerships worthwhile?Piracy is an industry-wide problem, and industry needs to come together to fight it. AVIA represents many of the biggest IP owners in the region and Google has the most popular search engine and online video platform, so a couple of years ago we both agreed that it made sense for us to sit down and have a frank and open conversation about the problems of piracy, understand the tools and measures Google is putting in place, and provide a forum for our members to raise concerns that Google may be able to address.It has been a constructive and collaborative process which has been appreciated on both sides. And it has led to new initiatives, including a workshop AVIA arranged for many of its Asia-based IP creators across India, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia\u2014designed to make better use of Google\u2019s tools for removing infringing content. It\u2019s a positive step that content producers, distributors and industry associations are now working together to address the problems, as well as partnering with technology platforms, payment processors, e-market platforms and other intermediaries.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Asia\n  \nSearch\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Advances in policy and technology have always led to progress and opportunity. But in Asia Pacific today, with another 663 million people poised to come online by 2025\u2014and the virus only increasing the importance of digital knowledge and tools\u2014 it\u2019s more important than ever that policymakers and technology-makers work towards common goals. It\u2019s how we ensure the benefits of technology are shared as widely and equitably as possible.Shared responsibilityThroughout the region, the pandemic has given rise to new public-private initiatives to protect people\u2019s health and livelihoods, and to help businesses and workers get through. Google is involved in many of them. Together with our government partners, we\u2019re focused on helping people reskill and find jobs, closing digital divides, and providing helpful platforms. We\u2019re supporting the growth of digital economies by investing in network and cloud infrastructure, and striving to make progress on challenges like combating misinformation, developing digital literacy and protecting privacy.We need to continue this spirit of shared responsibility, not just during the recovery from COVID, but to lay the ground for the long term. Jobs initiatives like Skills Ignition in Singapore\u00a0show how government-industry collaboration can be a model for a more inclusive type of recovery. At the same time, there\u2019s scope for partnership on a much broader range of challenges where technology can make a difference, from disaster readiness to disease prevention. In many of these areas, the work being done in Asia Pacific is world-leading.\u00a0Global leadership on digital tradeWhen it comes to government policy, the Asia Pacific region has another opportunity to lead the way globally. The region has been central to global trade for centuries\u2014the next step is to translate this for the digital era.\u00a0Two recent digital trade agreements\u2014between Singapore and Australia, and between Singapore, New Zealand and Chile\u2014show Asia Pacific governments setting global rules for digital trade. They\u2019re a template for how countries can share and protect data, foster new ideas, grow digital industries and\u2014most importantly\u2014harness technology to create jobs and improve living standards.\u00a0We will need more such agreements in the wake of the coronavirus. Fair and open access to digital platforms and tools is critical for small businesses and startups, enabling them to compete in international markets, and boosting economic growth across borders. In Southeast Asia, to use one example, Bain estimates that digital integration could add $1 trillion to regional GDP by 2025.\u00a0Equally important is the message that digital trade agreements send. The right approach to economic recovery is cooperation, not protectionism, including preserving and strengthening the open, global internet as a foundation for commerce and entrepreneurship. We recognize Google\u2019s responsibility in this, and we want to work with governments, businesses, and international organizations like the Asian Development Bank to ensure the digital infrastructure is in place for talent and trade to thrive in the decade ahead.\u00a0Over 30 years in diplomacy and business, I\u2019ve seen the power of effective partnership and far-sighted policy in this region\u2019s incredible progress. All of us at Google are looking forward to helping build on that progress in the post-COVID world.\u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Asia\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Our engineers work to offer the best search engine possible, constantly improving and fine-tuning it. We think that\u2019s why a wide cross-section of Americans value and often love our free products.\u00a0Today\u2019s lawsuit by the Department of Justice is deeply flawed. People use Google because they choose to, not because they're forced to, or because they can't find alternatives.\u00a0This lawsuit would do nothing to help consumers. To the contrary, it would artificially prop up lower-quality search alternatives, raise phone prices, and make it harder for people to get the search services they want to use.\nThe Department's dubious complaintLet's talk specifics. The Department's complaint relies on dubious antitrust arguments to criticize our efforts to make Google Search easily available to people.\u00a0Yes, like countless other businesses, we pay to promote our services, just like a cereal brand might pay a supermarket to stock its products at the end of a row or on a shelf at eye level. For digital services, when you first buy a device, it has a kind of home screen \u201ceye level shelf.\u201d On mobile, that shelf is controlled by Apple, as well as companies like AT&T, Verizon, Samsung and LG. On desktop computers, that shelf space is overwhelmingly controlled by Microsoft.\u00a0So, we negotiate agreements with many of those companies for eye-level shelf space. But let's be clear\u2014our competitors are readily available too, if you want to use them.\u00a0Our agreements with Apple and other device makers and carriers are no different from the agreements that many other companies have traditionally used to distribute software. Other search engines, including Microsoft\u2019s Bing, compete with us for these agreements. And our agreements have passed repeated antitrust reviews.\u00a0Here's more detail:\nApple devicesApple features Google Search in its Safari browser because they say Google is \u201cthe best.\u201d This arrangement is not exclusive\u2014our competitors Bing and Yahoo! pay to prominently feature, and other rival services also appear.\nChanging your search engine in Safari is easy. On desktop, one click and you\u2019re presented with a range of options.\nApple\u2019s iPhone makes it simple to change your settings and use alternative search engines in Safari\u2014and it\u2019s even easier in iOS14 where you can add widgets from different providers or swipe on the home screen to search. \nMicrosoftGoogle doesn't come preloaded on Windows devices. Microsoft preloads its Edge browser on Windows devices, where Bing is the default search engine.\nAndroidOn Android devices, we have promotional agreements with carriers and device makers to feature Google services. These agreements enable us to distribute Android for free, so they directly reduce the price that people pay for phones. But even with these agreements, carriers and device makers often preload numerous competing apps and app stores.\nLook how easy it is to add a different search app or widget on Android.\nThe bigger point the lawsuit misses\u00a0The bigger point is that people don\u2019t use Google because they have to, they use it because they choose to. This isn\u2019t the dial-up 1990s, when changing services was slow and difficult, and often required you to buy and install software with a CD-ROM. Today, you can easily download your choice of apps or change your default settings in a matter of seconds\u2014faster than you can walk to another aisle in the grocery store.\u00a0This lawsuit claims that Americans aren\u2019t sophisticated enough to do this. But we know that\u2019s not true. And you know it too: people downloaded a record 204 billion apps in 2019. Many of the world's most popular apps aren't preloaded\u2014think of Spotify, Instagram, Snapchat, Amazon and Facebook.The data shows that people choose their preferred service: take Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser as an example. It\u2019s funded almost entirely by revenue from search promotional agreements.\u00a0 When Yahoo! paid to be the default search engine in Firefox, most Americans promptly switched their search engine to their first choice\u2014Google. (Mozilla later chose Google to be its default search provider, citing an \u201ceffort to provide quality search\u201d and its \u201cfocus on user experience.\u201d)It\u2019s also trivially easy to change your search engine in our browser, Chrome.\nHow people access information todayThere's another area in which the lawsuit is wrong about how Americans use the Internet. It claims that we compete only with other general search engines. But that\u2019s demonstrably wrong. People find information in lots of ways: They look for news on Twitter, flights on Kayak and Expedia, restaurants on OpenTable, recommendations on Instagram and Pinterest. And when searching to buy something, around 60 percent of Americans start on Amazon. Every day, Americans choose to use all these services and thousands more.\nNext stepsWe understand that with our success comes scrutiny, but we stand by our position. American antitrust law is designed to promote innovation and help consumers, not tilt the playing field in favor of particular competitors or make it harder for people to get the services they want. We\u2019re confident that a court will conclude that this suit doesn\u2019t square with either the facts or the law.\u00a0In the meantime, we remain absolutely focused on delivering the free services that help Americans every day. Because that\u2019s what matters most.You can learn more about our approach to competition at g.co/competition. \nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

The mental anguish many veterans suffer is not as readily diagnosed and effectively treated as physical wounds that leave scars. Nevertheless, they can be just as lasting.\u00a0Veterans can miss out on getting mental health treatment out of fear of being stigmatized or simply not knowing who to turn to. Studies have shown that around 20 percent of veterans who served in operations in Iraq now suffer from PTSD, a condition exacerbated today by the challenges presented by a global pandemic, with a 20 percent spike in military suicides in 2020 alone. Further, a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Public Health shows over 1.1 million veterans treated in the VA between 2010 and 2011 were diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, substance abuse disorder, or schizophrenia.\u00a0The anguish of these struggles is felt in many ways. A veteran suffering from mental health issues has a higher chance of becoming homeless, and of being unemployed. The anxiety of not knowing when the next paycheck will come can serve to further exacerbate the mental health issues a person might be facing. We can\u2014and must\u2014do more to help.\u00a0We can begin by destigmatizing mental illness and making resources available to our veterans and their families. Alongside a community of veterans, Google has launched a new veterans\u2019 wellness website, Serving Veterans. This new hub will provide up-to-date, authoritative information about the mental health issues uniquely experienced by our veterans\u2014which we hope will lessen the stigma and isolation associated with so many of these diagnoses.\u00a0There are many organizational and logistical barriers to care but we want veterans to know that it is honorable and expected to receive help. That\u2019s why this new hub combines destigmatizing messaging from a diverse chorus of military leaders reiterating the importance of seeking help\u2014alongside mental health resources, including online and local support from helpful nonprofit organizations dedicated to helping veterans and their families. The hope is that increasing the visibility and availability of these resources will reduce the barriers to access for the people seeking them.\u00a0This issue won\u2019t be easy to solve. Moving forward, we hope that more tools like this become available. And we hope that by combining the tools and skills of the private sector with the resources of government and veterans' own unique perspectives, we can find even greater solutions. \nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

{"date": "2020-09-03 15:30:00+00:00", "title": "A more responsible, innovative and helpful internet in Europe", "category": "Google in Europe", "url": "https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/more-responsible-innovative-and-helpful-internet-europe/", "post_text": "Over the last 20 years, digital tools have played an increasingly important role in our everyday lives, in societal debate and in the economy. In 2020, many of us have found digital tools to be a real lifeline. We've used them to connect with loved ones and teach our children during lockdown. Governments have used them to share vital information with citizens. And businesses across Europe are using them to reach customers and recover more quickly and sustainably. As we look to the future, it's important that regulation keeps pace with change, and Google supports Europe's effort to create a more responsible, innovative and helpful internet for everyone.That's why we are submitting our response today to the consultation for the European Digital Services Act (DSA), drawing on our 20+ years experience in building technology that both helps people and creates greater economic opportunity. Well-designed regulation gives consumers confidence that their interests are being protected as they shop, search and socialize online. It also provides businesses with protection from opaque or unfair practices.Our response encourages European policymakers to build on the success of the e-Commerce Directive and focus on three key areas:\u00a0A more responsible internet: Introducing clearer rules for notifying platforms of illegal content while protecting fundamental rights of expression and access to information\u00a0A more innovative internet: Encouraging economic growth and innovation by enabling Europeans to build the next generation of apps, businesses and services, and exporting European creativity and culture around the worldA more helpful internet: Competition regulation which supports product innovations, helps people manage their data and provides businesses with the tools to grow\u00a0\nA more responsible internetBecause of our commitment to safety, we invest heavily in technology and people to combat illegal content, and we welcome an updated legal framework. We would encourage legislators to\u00a0 provide greater clarity on the rules, roles and responsibilities of online platforms.\u00a0The e-Commerce Directive set vital ground rules for conduct and responsibility online, which helped online innovation thrive. Whether an individual is claiming defamation, a studio is claiming that a video infringes on copyright or a government is seeking to remove a terrorist video, it\u2019s essential to provide clear notice about the specific piece of content to the online platform.\u00a0 The platform then has a responsibility to take appropriate action on that content. This is especially important given the significant differences in what is considered illegal content across EU Member States.\u00a0We are continually seeking to improve our technical systems and processes to identify illegal content. While breakthroughs in machine learning and other technology have significantly enhanced our ability to detect bad content, such technology is still unable to reliably understand context, which is often critical in determining whether or not content is legal, for example distinguishing violent content from a human rights organization documenting abuses. Mandated use of such technology would lead to overblocking of Europeans\u2019 speech and access to information. This is why platforms should be encouraged to further invest in these innovations while retaining the invaluable nuance and judgment that comes with human input.\u00a0Google's products are designed to encourage people to share their views safely and respectfully, and have been a force for creativity, learning and expression. In order to ensure that fundamental rights are respected, it's important for the DSA to focus on capturing illegal content, so lawful speech isn't caught in the net. However, this should not prevent further actions on lawful-but-harmful content, such as cyber-bullying, through self- and co-regulatory initiatives, such as the EU Code of Practice on Disinformation and the EU Code of Conduct on Hate Speech, both of which Google joined from the start. Google also invests in easy-to-use reporting processes and clear guidelines to help ensure a positive online experience.We are committed to providing greater transparency for our users and governments so that they better understand the content they are seeing and how to notify us of concerns. The DSA should support these kinds of constructive transparency measures while ensuring that platforms can continue to protect user privacy, ensure commercially sensitive information is not revealed and prevent bad actors from gaming the system. Google has long been a leader in transparency, including disclosing data on content moderation, content removal requests and blocking bad ads.\u00a0\u00a0A more innovative internetThe e-Commerce Directive, which the DSA will update, has guided Internet services, users and European society through 20 years of economic growth fueled by innovation, including entirely new industries ranging from app developers to YouTube creators.\u00a0 The next wave of online innovation will play a vital role in helping people, governments and businesses overcome the many challenges - medical, societal, economic - that come with a global pandemic.To foster innovation, the DSA should reflect the wide range of services offered by the tech industry. No two services are the same and the new act should be rooted in objectives and principles that can be applied, as appropriate, across this broad, diverse ecosystem.\u00a0 This will ensure that everyone - platforms regulators, people and businesses -\u00a0 are responsible for the parts they play.\u00a0A more helpful internetPeople want to save time and get things done when they are online. Our testing has consistently shown that people want quick access to information, so over the years we\u2019ve developed new ways to organize and display results. For example, when you are searching online for a restaurant, you can at the same time quickly access directions because a map has been integrated into Google\u2019s Search results pages - saving you the time and effort of a second search through a map app or website. Integrations also help small businesses to be found more easily and to provide relevant information to their customers such as delivery, curbside pickup or takeaway options during lockdown periods, and can help people in times of emergency such as the Android Emergency location feature. New rules should encourage new and improved features and products which help European consumers get things done and access information quickly and easily.\nEuropean startups and entrepreneurs also need online tools to help grow their businesses more easily and at a lower cost. For example, online ads help businesses of all sizes find new customers around the world, while cloud computing helps reduce operating costs and increase productivity. As the Commission updates its regulations, it should ensure new rules don't add undue cost and burden for European businesses in ways that make it harder to scale quickly and offer their services across the EU and around the world.We agree that competition between digital platforms is strengthened by measures that allow people to move between platforms without losing access to their data, which also makes it easier for new players to enter or expand in digital markets. Google offers a wide range of tools that allow people to be in control of their online experience, such as Google\u00a0\u201cMy Account\u201d, which helps users choose the privacy settings that are right for them, or Google\u00a0Takeout, which allows users to export their data. Similarly, providing access to aggregated datasets could\u00a0benefit R&D in a range of industries\u00a0while safeguarding user data privacy. As new rules are being evaluated, the question is not whether data mobility or data access should be facilitated, but how to achieve their benefits without sacrificing product quality or innovation incentives.\u00a0Modernizing regulationCreating a more responsible, innovative and helpful internet is a societal challenge, and we acknowledge the need for companies, governments and civil society to work together towards reaching our shared goals. That\u2019s why we support modernizing rules for the digital age.\u00a0Our response today is committed to creating a balanced regulatory framework that can adapt to future technological innovations so we can build on the momentum and benefits that online services have provided European citizens and businesses over the past two decades.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Our legal case with Oracle turns on our belief that interoperability has been good for innovation, good for developers, and good for consumers.The Supreme Court has heard from 250 leading computer scientists, businesses, and software developers who share this conviction. The Court also recently asked for additional information about how courts should respect a jury\u2019s decision that a given use (like the reuse of software interfaces) constitutes allowable fair use.\u00a0Today, we filed a supplemental brief explaining how the jury in our case heard from over a dozen witnesses, reviewed hundreds of documents, and then unanimously agreed with our position.

We employ more than 75,000 people in the U.S. across 26 states. The Progressive Policy Institute estimated that in 2018 we invested more than $20 billion in the U.S., citing us as the largest capital investor in America that year, and one of the top five for the last three years.One way we contribute is by building helpful products. Research found that free services like Search, Gmail, Maps, and Photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American. Many are small businesses using our digital tools to grow:Stone Dimensions, a family-owned stone company in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, uses Google My Business to draw new customers.\u00a0Gil\u2019s Appliances\u2014a family-owned appliance store in Bristol, Rhode Island\u2014credits Google Analytics with helping them reach customers online during the pandemic. Nearly one-third of small business owners say that without digital tools they would have had to close all or part of their business during COVID.\u00a0Another way we contribute is by being among the world\u2019s biggest investors in research and development. At the end of 2019, our R&D spend had increased tenfold over 10 years, from $2.8 billion to $26 billion, and we\u2019ve invested over $90 billion over the last five years. Our engineers are helping America remain a global leader in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, and quantum computing.\u00a0Just as America\u2019s technology leadership is not inevitable, Google\u2019s continued success is not guaranteed. New competitors emerge every day, and today users have more access to information than ever before. Competition drives us to innovate, and it also leads to better products, lower prices and more choices for everyone. For example, competition helped lower online advertising costs by 40 percent over the last decade, with savings passed down to consumers.\u00a0Open platforms like Android also support the innovation of others. Using Android, thousands of mobile operators build and sell their own devices, without paying any licensing fees to us. This has enabled billions of consumers to afford cutting-edge smartphones, some for less than $50. Whether building tools for small businesses or platforms like Android, Google succeeds when others succeed.\u00a0Competition also sets higher standards for privacy and security. I\u2019ve always believed that privacy is a universal right, and Google is committed to keeping your information safe, treating it responsibly, and putting you in control, and we\u2019ve long supported the creation of comprehensive federal privacy laws.I\u2019ve never forgotten how access to technology and innovation changed the course of my life. Google aims to build products that increase access to opportunity for everyone\u2014no matter where you live, what you believe, or how much money you earn.\u00a0\u00a0We are committed to doing this responsibly\u2014in partnership with lawmakers\u2014to ensure every American has access to the incredible opportunity technology creates.Thank you.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

From Search to YouTube, Gmail to Google Maps\u2014we\u2019ve worked to ensure that our products increase access to information, help people connect with one another, and amplify opportunities around the world. In doing so, Google\u2019s business, products, and technology have long had implications for the advancement of global human rights.As a founding member of the Global Network Initiative (GNI), we\u2019ve worked closely with civil society, academics, investors and industry peers to protect and advance freedom of expression and privacy globally as we deliver high-quality, relevant and useful content. Yesterday, GNI released its third assessment of Google, conducted by an independent third party, and determined that we are making good-faith efforts to implement the GNI Principles with improvement over time.\u00a0The report provides an overview of how the GNI Principles are integrated into our governance structure, due diligence and risk management, and operational practices regarding freedom of expression and privacy. Senior management oversees the implementation of the GNI Principles at Google and provides quarterly updates to the Board of Directors. We\u2019ve implemented an extensive network of Googlers covering product, jurisdiction, and functional areas who are responsible for the day-to-day work of protecting user rights of freedom of expression and privacy. Members of these teams can escalate issues to Google\u2019s senior management, and are supported by a global human rights policy lead.\u00a0\u00a0As we reflect on Google\u2019s assessments and some of the recent developments in our work to protect the free expression and privacy interests of our users, and our responsibilities to the societies in which we operate, we wanted to highlight a few examples of how our engagement with GNI continues to inform our broader approach to human rights.\nTransparencyTransparency is core to Google\u2019s commitment to respect human rights. Ten years ago (almost to the day!) Google launched a tool to inform people about government requests for user data or content removal.\u00a0Now the Google Transparency Report hub includes transparency reports on requests for user information, government requests to remove content, traffic and disruptions, among many other topics. In April 2018, YouTube took an important first step by releasing a quarterly report on the types and amount of content we remove for violating the YouTube Community Guidelines. Since then, we\u2019ve continued to add more data\u2014disclosing the policy reasons for video and channel removals, the country of upload for video removals, and information about comment removals and appeals\u2014reflecting Google\u2019s continued commitment to iterate on our transparency reporting.\nAI principlesIn 2018, we published Google\u2019s AI principles, which affirm our commitment to socially beneficial and accountable AI technology, and explicitly state that we won\u2019t design or deploy AI technology that violates international law and human rights. This builds upon our core efforts to incorporate the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights into our responsible decision-making around emerging technologies.\u00a0Since announcing the principles, we\u2019ve established and evolved our formal processes to ensure we\u2019re thoughtfully considering and assessing new AI projects, products and deals. Human rights due diligence is part of that process.\u00a0\nHuman rights by design\u00a0Before creating our Celebrity Recognition tool, Google Cloud asked the human rights experts at Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) to conduct a human rights impact assessment (HRIA). The BSR assessment helped inform and strengthen Google\u2019s \u201chuman rights by design\u201d approach\u2014further integrating human rights into product design and development, and strengthened human rights management at Google by embedding more capacity across various Google teams.\u00a0Integrating the human rights assessment in the process of product development ensured that we were following our AI Principles and meeting our broader responsibility to consider and mitigate potential human rights risks. This due diligence helped us build a product in a sensitive area and encourage product managers to and think about product challenges in a new way. When we announced the Celebrity Recognition tool in October 2019, we also released a summary of our Human Rights Impact Assessment.The GNI assessment also provided\u00a0 recommendations for enhancing our implementation of the GNI Principles, which\u00a0 will inform our policies and practices and strengthen our advocacy in 2020. All of this work helps us incorporate business and human rights principles into Google\u2019s long-term strategies and day-to-day decision-making. We\u2019ll continue to build on this approach, enriching lives and strengthening our communities in the future.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAI\n  "}

A powerful example is our data center in Pryor, a town in Mayes County, Oklahoma. Last year, I visited Pryor to announce a $600 million investment, our fourth expansion there since 2007. It felt like the whole community came out to welcome us, from small business owners to teachers to Google employees. Pryor Mayor Larry Lees told the crowd that Google\u2019s investments have helped provide local schools with the resources they need\u2014including the latest textbooks and STEM courses\u2014to offer a world-class education. He talked about the small businesses we have helped train and the mentorship Googlers have provided to Pryor\u2019s students.\u00a0This is exactly the kind of difference we hope to make with our new office and data center projects in 2020. These investments will create thousands of jobs\u2014including roles within Google, construction jobs in data centers and renewable energy facilities, and opportunities in local businesses in surrounding towns and communities.\u00a0This effort builds on the momentum of the $13 billion investment in communities from South Carolina to Nevada we made in 2019. Combined with other R&D investments, Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet was the largest investor in the U.S. last year, according to a report from the Progressive Policy Institute.\u00a0\u00a0We look forward to continuing this progress in the year ahead. Here\u2019s a look at our 2020 investments by region:\nSouthGoogle continues to invest in Atlanta, and we will be welcoming new engineering teams to our growing office there this year. We will also invest in expanded offices and data centers in Texas, Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee. Plus, we\u2019ll open a Google Operations Center in Mississippi to improve our customer support for users and partners around the world.\u00a0\nBreaking ground at our office development in Atlanta in 2019. We\u2019re expanding our space in Atlanta this year.\nMidwest\u00a0We recently opened a new Google Cloud office in Chicago and expanded our office in Madison, Wisconsin. We\u2019ll make additional investments in our offices in Detroit, open a new data center in Ohio, and complete the expansion of our data center in Iowa.\nRibbon cutting at our new Google Cloud office in Chicago in 2019.\nCentral\u00a0In Colorado, we have the capacity to double our workforce over the next few years, in part by expanding our presence in Boulder.\u00a0We\u2019ll also invest further in growing data centers in Nebraska and Oklahoma.\u00a0\nGoogle\u2019s Mayes County, Oklahoma data center expansion event.\u00a0 \nEast\u00a0We\u2019re opening our new Hudson Square campus in New York City, where we have the capacity to double our local workforce by 2028. We\u2019re also expanding our office in Pittsburgh, and a bigger office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is under development.\u00a0\nWest\u00a0We are expanding our Google Cloud campus in Seattle and undertaking a major development in Kirkland to open later this year. We\u2019re making office and data center investments in Oregon. In California, we continue to invest in new locations in the Bay Area and Los Angeles.\u00a0We\u2019ll also accelerate our work with businesses, governments, and community organizations to distribute the $1 billion we committed for Bay Area\u00a0housing. In the first six months of this commitment, we\u2019ve helped to create more than 380 new affordable housing units in the Bay Area, including an investment in a development focused on affordable and inclusive\u00a0housing for adults with disabilities. There\u2019s more to come in 2020.In addition to these investments in infrastructure and jobs, we\u2019ll also continue our work nationally with local startups, entrepreneurs and small business owners to help Americans access new digital opportunities. Already Grow with Google and Google for Startups have trained more than 4 million Americans in hundreds of communities across all 50 states. Looking ahead, we're especially excited about our work creating pathways to jobs in the fast-growing field of IT through\u00a0our two Grow with Google certificate programs.\u00a0Our growth\u00a0is made possible only with the help of our local Googlers, partners and communities who have welcomed Google with open arms. Working together, we will continue to grow our economy, create good jobs for more Americans and make sure everyone can access the opportunities that technology creates.\nPOSTED IN:\nCompany announcements\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nData Centers and Infrastructure\n  "}

Building on our work to support the operations and security of the 2020 U.S. Census, we\u2019re sharing more about what we\u2019re doing to tackle abuse on our platforms, equip campaigns, and help voters.\u00a0\nTackling threats and abuseOur Trust and Safety teams span the globe to monitor and disrupt account hijackings, inauthentic activity, disinformation campaigns, coordinated attacks, and other forms of abuse on our platforms on a 24/7 basis. We take seriously our responsibility to protect our users from harm and abuse, especially during elections.\u00a0That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed policies that prohibit deceptive practices and abuse such as voter suppression and misrepresentation in our products, including Google Ads, YouTube or Google Play. For example, Google Play has implemented new policies to mitigate misleading claims and promote transparency about the sources of government information including voting information communicated through apps. We work together with Jigsaw to advance research on \u201cdeep fake\u201d detection\u2014and protect the accounts of users and campaigns that are targeted by hacking or phishing. Every day, Gmail blocks more than 100 million phishing emails and Google Safe Browsing helps protect more than 4 billion devices against dangerous sites.\u00a0As part of our ongoing efforts to counter interference on our platforms, we work closely with other technology companies and government agencies, such as the FBI\u2019s Foreign Influence Task Force, on referrals and leads. Alongside my colleagues at Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, and at YouTube, we work closely to identify bad actors, disable their accounts, warn our users about them, and share relevant information with industry officials and law enforcement. We will continue to provide updates with findings around state-sponsored phishing attacks, coordinated influence operations, and disinformation campaigns.\u00a0\nEquipping campaignsAs we approach November\u2019s election, we\u2019ll continue to educate campaigns and elected officials on how they can effectively use Google and YouTube products to reach voters. Candidates can claim their knowledge panels so people have access to quality, authoritative information right in Google Search. And we work with them to optimize their presence on YouTube by helping them get verified and more effectively engage with voters through YouTube.\u00a0Additionally, we\u2019re committed to enhancing election security for campaigns, voters and journalists alike. We created Protect Your Election, a suite of free tools to help protect high-risk users from the most pervasive digital attacks, like DDoS and phishing attacks (to which politicians, journalists, and campaigns are often most vulnerable). Our Advanced Protection Program and Jigsaw\u2019s Project Shield help combat the types of digital attacks that could threaten account and web-site security.\u00a0As part of these efforts, we\u2019re supporting the new Election Security and Information Project, run out of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School. Last week, the trainers kicked off the first of many election security training sessions that will take place in every state across the country. This nonpartisan program is designed to help campaigns, academics, elected officials and NGOs prepare for election-related security challenges between now and November.\u00a0\nHelping votersWhether you\u2019re registering for the first time, looking for your polling place, or voting absentee, we want to help you navigate the process. For years, we've worked with trusted organizations and built tools into Google Search to do just that\u2014to provide you with authoritative and objective information in a completely neutral way. Our systems are designed to elevate authoritative content when people seek information about topics such as elections or candidates. We do this not only for users directly on our own platform, but also by supporting the civic technology ecosystem through products like the Google Civic Information API. These products allow third-party developers to create useful applications to help people find information, for instance, about where to vote.\u00a0As the election season unfolds, you can tune into YouTube to watch political events and follow debate livestreams. Over the past few years, YouTube has invested in the teams and systems to raise up quality content, such as prioritizing authoritative voices in search results for news and topics prone to misinformation.\u00a0And for the 2020 elections, you can search for political ads with more visibility than ever before: you\u2019ll be able to see more types of ads in our Political Ads Transparency Report and Ad Library, including ads that mention federal or state-level candidates, officeholders, ballot measures and political parties. As you may have seen, we recently announced changes to our global political ads policies that expand verification and transparency measures to ads that mention state-level candidates and officeholders, ballot measures, and political parties.\u00a0We will continue our work across Google and YouTube to tackle abuse on our platforms and help you navigate the democratic process before you head to the ballot box on November 3.\u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nCivics\n  "}

Open software interfaces let smartphone apps and other services connect across devices and operating systems. And interoperability\u2014the ability of different software systems to exchange information\u2014lets people mix and match great features, and helps developers create new products that work across platforms. The result? Consumers get more choices for how they use software tools; developers and startups can challenge bigger incumbents; and businesses can move data from one platform to another without missing a beat.\u00a0This kind of open and collaborative innovation, from scientific peer-reviewed papers to open-source software, has been key to America\u2019s achievements in science and technology.That\u2019s why today we filed our opening Supreme Court brief in Oracle\u2019s lawsuit against us. We\u2019re asking the Court to reaffirm the importance of the software interoperability that has allowed millions of developers to write millions of applications that work on billions of devices. As Microsoft said in an earlier filing in this case: \"Consumers ... expect to be able to take a photo on their Apple phone, save it onto Google\u2019s cloud servers, and edit it on their Surface tablets.\"\u00a0The Court will review whether copyright should extend to nuts-and-bolts software interfaces, and if so, whether it can be fair to use those interfaces to create new technologies, as the jury in this case found. Software interfaces are the access points that allow computer programs to connect to each other, like plugs and sockets. Imagine a world in which every time you went to a different building, you needed a different plug to fit the proprietary socket, and no one was allowed to create adapters.This case will make a difference for everyone who touches technology\u2014from startups to major tech platforms, software developers to product manufacturers, businesses to consumers\u2014and we\u2019re pleased that many leading representatives of those groups will be filing their own briefs to support our position.Open interfaces between programs are the building blocks of many of the services and products we use today, as well as of technologies we haven\u2019t yet imagined. An Oracle win would upend the way the technology industry has always approached the important issue of software interfaces. It would for the first time grant copyright owners a monopoly power to stymie the creation of new implementations and applications. And it would make it harder and costlier for developers and startups to create more products for people to use.We welcome the opportunity to appear before the Supreme Court this spring to argue for software interoperability that has promoted the progress of science and useful arts\u2014the core purpose of American copyright law.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

With over 70 percent of U.S. households using the internet at home, and 80 percent using smartphones, this new format will allow more people to participate in the census next year.\u00a0Yesterday, U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), and 41 of their Senate colleagues introduced a bipartisan resolution to ensure the census count is fair and accurate, and to urge participation by everyone, and Google is a strong supporter of the resolution.To support the new online option, we\u2019re working to connect people with useful and high-quality information about the census.\u00a0 Building upon our ongoing work to protect the integrity of information and civic processes, this past March we established our 2020 U.S. Census Taskforce, a team to support the operations and security of the 2020 Census across Google and YouTube. Its primary objective is to prevent bad actors from abusing our services to spread misinformation, or to conduct fraudulent activity around the census such as phishing or other scams. We\u2019ll provide regular updates on our efforts to the Census Bureau and other relevant organizations. Here's a look at some of the work we're doing on this front.\nYouTube policiesYouTube expanded its existing\u00a0deceptive practices policy\u00a0to explicitly cover the census process. Videos and comments that aim to misinform viewers about the time, means or eligibility requirements for participating in the census are not allowed on YouTube.\nPolicies for ads on our platformsOur policies already prohibit ads that contain misleading uses of official government sites or agency names, or attempt to mimic the layout and design of an official government agency site.\u00a0Last month\u00a0we clarified this policy to explicitly prohibit ads featuring incorrect information about how to participate in the census.\u00a0\u00a0\nSecurity protections for Gmail and ChromeEvery day, Gmail blocks more than 100 million\u00a0phishing emails\u00a0and\u00a0Google Safe Browsing\u00a0helps protect more than 4 billion devices against dangerous sites. Our team is working to ensure that legitimate emails from the Census Bureau are delivered, and to block phishing attempts (such as attempts to drive users to fake census websites, or to hand over personal information or account information). Security tools like Safe Browsing in Chrome are turned on by default, and can warn people of compromised sites related to the census.\nAccess to authoritative information on SearchSearch is designed to surface relevant results from the most authoritative sources available. As part of our\u00a0efforts to tackle disinformation\u00a0and stay ahead of the malicious actors that propagate it, we\u2019re improving our systems and\u00a0elevating authoritative information, particularly for important areas like civics and news.\nEngagement with partner organizationsWe\u2019ll share actionable information with other companies, law enforcement and the U.S. Census Bureau to help investigate, identify and resolve relevant issues. The U.S. Census Bureau is joining the\u00a0YouTube Trusted Flagger\u00a0program so it can augment our efforts by quickly notifying YouTube of census-related content that violates our policies.\u00a0\nTransparency for government information on PlayTo promote transparency about the sources of government information communicated through apps on the Google Play Store, a recent policy update now requires apps that communicate government information but are not affiliated with a government entity to provide users the source(s) of this information. Census partners will need to provide the sources of any census related information they provide in their app and make clear the nature of their relationship with the census.As other countries make a similar shift to an online census, we hope the work we\u2019re doing for the 2020 Census in the United States will be a strong foundation on which to build.You can learn more about the count by visiting the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s official website.\nPOSTED IN:\nSafety & Security\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2019-11-20 23:00:00+00:00", "title": "An update on our political ads policy", "category": "Ads", "url": "https://blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/", "post_text": "We\u2019re proud that people around the world use Google to find relevant information about elections and that candidates use Google and search ads to raise small-dollar donations that help fund their campaigns. We\u2019re also committed to a wide range of efforts to help protect campaigns, surface authoritative election news, and protect elections from foreign interference.But given recent concerns and debates about political advertising, and the importance of shared trust in the democratic process, we want to improve voters' confidence in the political ads they may see on our ad platforms. So we\u2019re making a few changes to how we handle political ads on our platforms globally. Regardless of the cost or impact to spending on our platforms, we believe these changes will help promote confidence in digital political advertising and trust in electoral processes worldwide.\u00a0\nOur ads platforms todayGoogle\u2019s ad platforms are distinctive in a number of important ways:\u00a0The main formats we offer political advertisers are search ads (which appear on Google in response to a search for a particular topic or candidate), YouTube ads (which appear on YouTube videos and generate revenue for those creators), and display ads (which appear on websites and generate revenue for our publishing partners).\u00a0We provide a publicly accessible, searchable, and downloadable transparency report of election ad content and spending on our platforms, going beyond what\u2019s offered by most other advertising media.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve never allowed granular microtargeting of political ads on our platforms. In many countries, the targeting of political advertising is regulated and we comply with those laws. In the U.S., we have offered basic political targeting capabilities to verified advertisers, such as serving ads based on public voter records and general political affiliations (left-leaning, right-leaning, and independent).\u00a0 \nTaking a new approach to targeting election adsWhile we've never offered granular microtargeting of election ads, we believe there\u2019s more we can do to further promote increased visibility of election ads. That\u2019s why we\u2019re limiting election ads audience targeting to the following general categories: age, gender, and general location (postal code level). Political advertisers can, of course, continue to do contextual targeting, such as serving ads to people reading or watching a story about, say, the economy. This will align our approach to election ads with long-established practices in media such as TV, radio, and print, and result in election ads being more widely seen and available for public discussion. (Of course, some media, like direct mail, continues to be targeted more granularly.) It will take some time to implement these changes, and we will begin enforcing the new approach in the U.K. within a week (ahead of the General Election), in the EU by the end of the year, and in the rest of the world starting on January 6, 2020.\nClarifying our ads policiesWhether you\u2019re running for office or selling office furniture, we apply the same ads policies to everyone; there are no carve-outs. It\u2019s against our policies for any advertiser to make a false claim\u2014whether it's a claim about the price of a chair or a claim that you can vote by text message, that election day is postponed, or that a candidate has died. To make this more explicit, we\u2019re clarifying our ads policies and adding examples to show how our policies prohibit things like \u201cdeep fakes\u201d (doctored and manipulated media), misleading claims about the census process, and ads or destinations making demonstrably false claims that could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process. Of course, we recognize that robust political dialogue is an important part of democracy, and no one can sensibly adjudicate every political claim, counterclaim, and insinuation. So we expect that the number of political ads on which we take action will be very limited\u2014but we will continue to do so for clear violations.\nProviding increased transparencyWe want the ads we serve to be transparent and widely available so that many voices can debate issues openly. We already offer election advertising transparency in India, in the EU, and for federal U.S. election ads. We provide both in-ad disclosures and a transparency report that shows the actual content of the ads themselves, who paid for them, how much they spent, how many people saw them, and how they were targeted. Starting on December 3, 2019, we\u2019re expanding the coverage of our election advertising transparency to include U.S. state-level candidates and officeholders, ballot measures, and ads that mention federal or state political parties, so that all of those ads will now be searchable and viewable as well.\u00a0We\u2019re also looking at ways to bring additional transparency to the ads we serve and we\u2019ll have additional details to share in the coming months. We look forward to continuing our work in this important area.\nPOSTED IN:\nAds\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nCivics\n  "}

Today, it\u2019s home to nearly 100 Native Americans from many tribes, four of whom are the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Confederated Tribes of Yakama, Confederated Tribes of Umatilla and the Nez Perce Tribe. And until now, the 16 homes in the village had sporadic or no access to Wi-Fi.\nDistributing Chromebooks to village residents in their renovated schoolhouse.\nThanks to a grant from Google, participation from the Google American Indian Network and collaboration with Dufur School, village residents and The Dalles Data Center, all homes now have access to Wi-Fi, and so do their schoolhouse and longhouse. Residents will have access to Chromebooks, and I put together a booklet with instructions on getting online and accessing Google apps.\nKaren Whitford, a resident and Elder of Celilo Village, tries out the Google Daydream View VR headset.\nThe idea for the partnership came from Celilo Village resident Bobby Begay, who talked to the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center about funding connectivity for the village. The Discovery Center then worked with Googlers across the company to get the project started, including the Google American Indian Network. We celebrated this special gift with a community event in Celilo Village over the weekend, where we were joined by tribal leaders, policymakers and community members.My fellow Googlers and I worked directly with the community to get this done, and we plan to keep our partnership going. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see the project come to fruition, but I think even more I\u2019m excited at the opportunity to foster a longer-term relationship with residents of Celilo,\u201d says my colleague Tria Bullard, one of the first Googlers to get involved with the project. We plan to provide more trainings and other computer science-related activities in the future.\u00a0My hope is that with this new window into technology, Celilo Village will continue to grow and thrive for years to come. And who knows: Maybe kids growing up there will become part of the next generation of scientists and engineers.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nData Centers and Infrastructure\n  \nDiversity and Inclusion\n  \nChromebooks\n  "}

The Digital Summit brings together stakeholders from across society to discuss technological innovation and the challenges facing all of us. It\u2019s a forum designed to tackle hard questions in a thoughtful, serious, and mutually respectful way. In that regard, the summit built on what I believe to be one of the more constructive and least told stories in modern history\u2014the relationship between technology and politics in society, and the work of policymakers who helped lay the foundation for our digital century.Over the past 30 years, in democracies around the world, policymakers\u2019 support for the free flow of goods, services, and ideas has created a larger, more diverse, more inclusive digital economy. It\u2019s fostered a world where individuals are empowered through wider access to knowledge, and where start-up entrepreneurs and small businesses can reach customers around the globe. As the World Bank has found, over the past 25 years more than 1 billion people have emerged from extreme poverty\u2014an event unparalleled in human history. That\u2019s due in no small part to the twin rise of technology and trade. And today, with innovations in areas like artificial intelligence, we stand on the cusp of even greater advances.This amazing story of human progress didn\u2019t come out of the ether. The policies and attitudes of open societies made it possible. From investments in ARPA and the National Science Foundation to the pioneering work at CERN, policymakers created the environment that made invention happen. More than just permitting innovation, they championed the idea of a world in which technology could support greater prosperity, freedom, and individual empowerment. History doesn\u2019t often talk about that, but I think it will ultimately tell the story of how that framework helped unleash the human ingenuity that will help us address the most serious challenges of our time.\u00a0To hear more, watch or read my full speech from the 2019 Digital Summit.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It means having a clear mind and a healthy body. It means having the foresight to say no to alcohol. It means having the mental clarity to thrive at work and the desire to live a fuller, happier, complete life.\u00a0As someone who has struggled with addiction and embarked on a journey toward recovery, I am so proud that Google is marking National Recovery Month with a new site, Recover Together. I participate in a recovery group at Google and know how important it is for this community to be connected. As part of Google\u2019s ongoing efforts to combat the opioid crisis, today we\u2019re taking an additional step to support those in recovery.Too many of us have experienced firsthand the devastating impact of addiction\u2014with our friends, colleagues, family members and loved ones. From the first time I filled my water bottle with alcohol and brought it to school at only 14 years old, to the many times I blacked out and woke up in the back seat of my car in surprising locations, I know how deeply addiction affected my life and worried my family.More than 21 million Americans struggle with substance use. But it is treatable: An estimated 1 out of 14 American adults is in recovery. In fact, people come to Google every day to seek information on addiction treatment, prevention and recovery. Just last month, we saw an all-time high in search interest for \u201crehab near me,\u201d \u201caddiction treatment near me\u201d and \u201chow to help an addict.\u201d\nStarting today, you can come to Google to find recovery resources all in one place, beginning with a video series from those in recovery. I felt less alone when hearing others share their stories, and I am grateful to be able to do the same here.\n10:25\nOur new Recovery Locator Tool in Maps.\u00a0\nWe\u2019re also launching two new Google Maps locator tools that will connect people with crucial recovery resources, including:\u00a0Recovery Locator Tool:\u00a0A map with locations of more than 83,000 recovery support meetings such as AA, NA, Al-Anon and SmartRecovery, and other services such as school-based and family support. These take place at more than 33,000 community centers, churches, and other spaces\u2014put in your address and you\u2019ll see many recovery services are in your area or wherever you\u2019re traveling.Naloxone Locator Tool:\u00a0 A special locator tool will show you locations where you can get Naloxone, the life-saving opioid overdose-reversal drug, without a prescription. All you have to do is type \u201cNaloxone near me\u201d or \u201cNarcan near me\u201d into the search bar in the tool. It already includes 20,000 pharmacies (including CVS, Rite-Aid and Walgreens) in 50 states, and we\u2019ll continue to add local clinics and independent pharmacies. The site will also have more information about the availability and life-saving capability of this medication. Soon, these locations will also be searchable directly in Google Maps.\nFinding recovery is a personal journey, and I am so grateful to work for a company that is making resources available to those who need them. In addition to these new tools, the site points to many other resources for those seeking treatment, including a self-assessment screener from the National Institute of Drug Abuse and state-specific Helpline resources and hotlines.\u00a0To anyone at the beginning stages of recovery: This process is hard and tiring and challenging and you do not need to figure this all out alone. From the moment I first connected to the Employee Assistance Program counselor at Google who helped me confront the reality of my addiction, my life has changed in ways that at one time seemed unimaginable. I teach yoga. I run marathons. My life has been enriched by others in the recovery community. My sorrow has been replaced with a joy I never thought possible. And today, my hope is that anyone seeking recovery can find the same help and resources through Google I wanted so many years ago. Recovery is difficult, and it is so much better when we\u2019re all in it together.\nPOSTED IN:\nCompany announcements\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

That\u2019s great news.We support the movement toward a new comprehensive, international framework for how multinational companies are taxed. Corporate income tax is an important way companies contribute to the countries and communities where they do business, and we would like to see a tax environment that people find reasonable and appropriate.While some have raised concerns about where Google pays taxes, Google\u2019s overall global tax rate has been over 23 percent for the past 10 years, in line with the 23.7 percent average statutory rate across the member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Most of these taxes are due in the United States, where our business originated, and where most of our products and services are developed. The rest we paid in the roughly fifty countries around the world where we have offices helping to sell our services.We\u2019re not alone in paying most of our corporate income tax in our home country. That allocation\u00a0 reflects long-standing rules about how corporate profits should be split among various countries. American companies pay most of their corporate taxes in the United States\u2014just as German, British, French and Japanese firms pay most of their corporate taxes in their home countries.\u00a0For over a century, the international community has developed treaties to tax foreign firms in a coordinated way. This framework has always attributed more profits to the countries where products and services are produced, rather than where they are consumed. But it\u2019s time for the system to evolve, ensuring a better distribution of tax income.The United States, Germany, and other countries have put forward new proposals for modernizing tax rules, with more taxes paid in countries where products and services are consumed. We hope governments can develop a consensus around a new framework for fair taxation, giving companies operating around the world clear rules that promote a sensible business investment.The need for modernization isn\u2019t limited to the technology sector. Both the OECD and a group of EU experts have concluded that the wider economy is \u201cdigitizing,\u201d creating a need for broad-based reform of current rules. Almost all multinational companies use data, computers, and internet connectivity to power their products and services. And many are seeking ways to integrate these technologies, creating \u201csmart\u201d appliances, cars, factories, homes and hospitals.\u00a0But even as this multilateral process is advancing, some countries are considering going it alone, imposing new taxes on foreign companies. Without a new, comprehensive and multilateral agreement, countries might simply impose discriminatory unilateral taxes on foreign firms in various sectors. Indeed, we already see such problems in some of the specific proposals that have been put forward.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That kind of race to the bottom would create new barriers to trade, slow cross-border investment, and hamper economic growth. We\u2019re already seeing this in a handful of countries proposing new taxes on all kinds of goods\u2014from software to consumer products\u2014that involve intellectual property. Specialized taxes on a handful of U.S. technology companies would do little more than claim taxes that are currently owed in the U.S., heightening trade tensions. But if governments work together, more taxes can be paid where products and services are consumed, in a coordinated and mutually acceptable way. This give-and-take is needed to ensure a better, more balanced global tax system.We believe this approach will restore confidence in the international tax system and promote more cross-border trade and investment. We strongly support the OECD\u2019s work to end the current uncertainty and develop new tax principles. We call on governments and companies to work together to accelerate this reform and forge a new, lasting, and global agreement.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

There\u2019s broad agreement on letting people create, communicate, and find information online, while preventing people from misusing content-sharing platforms like social networks and video-sharing sites.We\u2019ve been working on this challenge for years, using both computer science tools and human reviewers to identify and stop a range of online abuse, from \u201cget rich quick\u201d schemes to disinformation to child sexual abuse material. We respond promptly to valid notices of specific illegal content, and we prohibit other types of content on various different services. A mix of people and technology helps us identify inappropriate content and enforce our policies, and we continue to improve our practices. Earlier this year we issued an in-depth review of how we combat disinformation, and YouTube continues to regularly update its Community Guidelines Enforcement Report.Tackling this problem is a shared responsibility. Many laws, covering everything from consumer protection to defamation to privacy, already govern online content. Safe harbors and Good Samaritan laws for online platforms support the free flow of information, innovation, and economic growth, while giving platforms the legal certainty they need to combat problematic content. Over the internet\u2019s history, many countries have not only established criteria to qualify for safe harbors, but also developed codes of practice (like the European Union\u2019s Code of Conduct On Countering Illegal Hate Speech and Code of Practice on Disinformation). And companies have worked together, as with the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, a coalition sharing information on curbing online terrorism. Approaches continue to evolve\u2014for instance, earlier this month we joined other companies and countries in signing the Christchurch Call to Action To Eliminate Terrorist and Violent Extremist Content Online.We\u2019ve previously shared our experiences in order to promote smart regulation in areas like privacy, artificial intelligence, and government surveillance, and I recently wrote about specific legal frameworks for combating illegal content online. In that spirit, we are offering some ideas for approaching oversight of content-sharing platforms:\nClarity - Content-sharing platforms are working to develop and enforce responsible content policies that establish baseline expectations for users and articulate a clear basis for removal of content as well as for suspension or closure of accounts. But it\u2019s also important for governments to draw clear lines between legal and illegal speech, based on evidence of harm and consistent with norms of democratic accountability and international human rights. Without clear definitions, there is a risk of arbitrary or opaque enforcement that limits access to legitimate information.Suitability - It\u2019s important for oversight frameworks to recognize the different purposes and functions of different services. Rules that make sense for social networks, video-sharing platforms, and other services primarily designed to help people share content with a broad audience may not be appropriate for search engines, enterprise services, file storage, communication tools, or other online services, where users have fundamentally different expectations and applications. Different types of content may likewise call for different approaches.Transparency - Meaningful transparency promotes accountability. We launched our first Transparency Report more than eight years ago, and we continue to extend our transparency efforts over time. Done thoughtfully, transparency can promote best practices, facilitate research, and encourage innovation, without enabling abuse of processes.Flexibility - We and other tech companies have pushed the boundaries of computer science in identifying and removing problematic content at scale. These technical advances require flexible legal frameworks, not static or one-size-fits-all mandates. Likewise, legal approaches should recognize the varying needs and capabilities of startups and smaller companies.Overall quality - The scope and complexity of modern platforms requires a data-driven approach that focuses on overall results rather than anecdotes. While we will never eliminate all problematic content, we should recognize progress in making that content less prominent. Reviews under the European Union\u2019s codes on hate speech and disinformation offer a useful example of assessing overall progress against a complex set of goals.Cooperation - International coordination should strive to align on broad principles and practices. While there is broad international consensus on issues like child sexual abuse imagery, in other areas individual countries will make their own choices about the limits of permissible speech, and one country should not be able to impose its content restrictions on another.\nThe recent Christchurch Call is a powerful reminder of what we can do when a range of stakeholders work together to address the challenges of online content. The internet has expanded access to information, bringing incredible benefits to people around the world. And as with any new information technology, societies and cultures are developing new social norms, institutions, and laws to address new challenges and opportunities. We look forward to contributing to that extraordinarily important project.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

There was no such thing as a web search engine. Most people didn't know what email was (let alone use it). And to participate in international trade, a business needed big financial resources, offices and staff around the world, and lots of fax machines.Thanks to the internet, that's all changed. Today, even the smallest of businesses can be global players and have customers in every corner of the world.\u00a0Using the internet and online tools, the family-run\u00a0Missouri Star Quilt Company\u00a0has built an international business by sharing quilting how-to videos on YouTube, and the social impact brand\u00a0Sword & Plough\u00a0has sold thousands of bags and accessories globally that support veteran jobs.The web has fundamentally changed not only how we trade, but also who trades. Small businesses using online tools are five times more likely to export than their offline counterparts. U.S. manufacturers are now the leading exporters of products and services online.That\u2019s why we need trade agreements that reflect the reality of today's economy. NAFTA references \u201ctelegrams\u201d multiple times, but doesn\u2019t even mention the internet. In contrast, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA) includes a comprehensive set of digital trade provisions that keep the internet open, and protect the businesses and consumers that rely on it:Trusted infrastructure: USMCA promotes an open and secure global technical infrastructure that supports a new kind of trade. For example, the agreement prohibits the U.S., Mexico and Canada from requiring that data be stored and replicated locally, reducing the cost of doing business in other countries and ensuring that data isn\u2019t vulnerable to attack. Innovation-enabling rules: USMCA promotes the open online framework that\u2019s been key to the success of the U.S. internet economy. This framework both allows for platform-based trade, and also empowers internet platforms to combat harmful content online and fight piracy. Protecting data: Consumers\u2019 privacy should be protected no matter what country an individual or business is located in, and USMCA reflects this important principle. The agreement promotes strong privacy laws and cybersecurity standards to protect people\u2019s data.Access to information: USMCA limits government restrictions on information flow across borders, recognizing that wide availability of information leads to more trade and economic growth. The agreement also encourages governments to release non-sensitive data in an open and machine-readable format, so companies of all sizes have the opportunity to build commercial applications and services with public information.Modernizing trade: Finally, USMCA prohibits our trading partners from imposing customs duties on things like e-books, videos, music, software, games and apps\u2014ensuring consumers can continue to enjoy free or low-cost digital products.USMCA will establish a strong framework to promote the new digital economy, and will unlock new sources of opportunity, creativity and job growth in North America. We look forward to seeing the agreement approved and implemented in a way that allows everyone to benefit from a free and open internet.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Communities around the world organized events, and we\u2019re taking a moment here at Google to share our own perspective on the importance of open data. More accessible data can meaningfully help people and organizations, and we\u2019re doing our part by opening datasets, providing access to APIs and aggregated product data, and developing tools to make data more accessible and useful.Responsibly opening datasetsSharing datasets is increasingly important as more people adopt machine learning through open frameworks like TensorFlow. We\u2019ve released over 50 open datasets for other developers and researchers to use. These include YouTube 8M, a corpus of annotated videos used externally for video understanding; the HDR+ Burst Photography dataset, which helps others experiment with the technology that powers Pixel features like Portrait Mode; and Open Images, along with the Open Images Extended dataset which increases photo diversity.Just because data is open doesn\u2019t mean it will be useful, however. First, a dataset needs to be cleaned so that any insights developed from it are based on well-structured and accurate examples. Cleaning a large dataset is no small feat; before opening up our own, we spend hundreds of hours standardizing data and validating quality. Second, a dataset should be shared in a machine-readable format that\u2019s easy for others to use, such as JSON rather than PDF. Finally, consider whether the dataset is representative of the intended content. Even if data is usable and representative of some situations, it may not be appropriate for every application. For instance, if a dataset contains mostly North American animal images, it may help you classify a deer, but not a giraffe. Tools like Facets can help you analyze the makeup of a dataset and evaluate the best ways to put it to use. We\u2019re also working to build more representative datasets through interfaces like the Crowdsource application. To guide others\u2019 use of your own dataset, consider publishing a data card which denotes authorship, composition and suggested use cases (here\u2019s an example from our Open Images Extended release). Making data findable and usefulIt\u2019s not enough to just make good data open, though\u2014it also needs to be findable.\u00a0Kaggle, a community of data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts, helps users store and query large datasets.\u00a0Nonetheless, researchers, developers, journalists and other curious data-seekers often struggle to locate data scattered across the web\u2019s thousands of repositories.\u00a0Our Dataset Search tool helps people find data sources wherever they\u2019re hosted, as long as the data is described in a way that search engines can locate. Since the tool launched a few months ago, we\u2019ve seen the number of unique datasets on the platform double to 10 million, including contributions from the U.S. National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Federal Reserve, the European Data Portal, the World Bank and government portals from every continent.What makes data useful is how easily it can be analyzed. Though there\u2019s more open data today, data scientists spend significant time analyzing it across multiple sources. To help solve that problem, we\u2019ve created Data Commons. It\u2019s a knowledge graph of data sources that lets users \u00a0treat various datasets of interest\u2014regardless of source and format\u2014as if they are all in a single local database. Anyone can contribute datasets or build applications powered by the infrastructure. For people using the platform, that means less time engineering data and more time generating insights. We\u2019re already seeing exciting use cases of Data Commons. In one UC Berkeley data science course taught by Josh Hug and Fernando Perez, students used Census, CDC and Bureau of Labor Statistics data to correlate obesity levels across U.S. cities with other health and economic factors. Typically, that analysis would take days or weeks; using Data Commons, students were able to build high-fidelity models in less than an hour. We hope to partner with other educators and researchers\u2014if you\u2019re interested, reach out to collaborate@datacommons.org.Balancing trade-offsThere are trade-offs to opening up data, and we aim to balance various sensitivities with the potential benefits of sharing. One consideration is that broad data openness can facilitate uses that don\u2019t align with our AI Principles. For instance, we recently made synthetic speech data available only to researchers participating in the 2019 ASVspoof Challenge, to ensure that the data can be used to develop tools to detect deepfakes, while limiting misuse.Extreme data openness can also risk exposing user or proprietary information, causing privacy breaches or threatening the security of our platforms. We allow third party developers to build on services like Maps, Gmail and more via APIs, so they can build their own products while user data is kept safe. We also publish aggregated product data like Search Trends to share information of public interest in a privacy-preserving way.While there can be benefits to using sensitive data in controlled and principled ways, like predicting medical conditions or events, it\u2019s critical that safeguards are in place so that training machine learning models doesn\u2019t compromise individual privacy. Emerging research provides promising new avenues to learn from sensitive data. One is Federated Learning, a technique for training global ML models without data ever leaving a person\u2019s device, which we\u2019ve recently made available open-source with TensorFlow Federated. Another is Differential Privacy, which can offer strong guarantees that training data details aren\u2019t inappropriately exposed in ML models. Additionally, researchers are experimenting more and more with using small training datasets and zero-shot learning, as we demonstrated in our recent prostate cancer detection research and work on Google Translate.We hope that our efforts will help people access and learn from clean, useful, relevant and privacy-preserving open data from Google to solve the problems that matter to them. We also encourage other organizations to consider how they can contribute\u2014whether by opening their own datasets, facilitating usability by cleaning them before release, using schema.org metadata standards to increase findability, enhancing transparency through data cards or considering trade-offs like user privacy and misuse. To everyone who has come together over the past week to celebrate open data: we look forward to seeing what you build.\nPOSTED IN:\nAI\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nResearch\n  "}

Last year, we partnered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for National Prescription Take Back Day by developing a Google Maps API \u00a0locator tool to help people dispose of their prescription drugs at temporary locations twice a year. With the help of this tool, the DEA and its local partners collected a record 1.85 million pounds of unused prescription drugs in 2018.Today, we\u2019re making it easier for Americans to quickly find disposal locations on Google Maps and Search all year round. A search for queries like \u201cdrug drop off near me\u201d or \u201cmedication disposal near me\u201d will display permanent disposal locations at your local pharmacy, hospital or government building so you can quickly and safely discard your unneeded medication.\nThis pilot has been made possible thanks to the hard work of many federal agencies, states and pharmacies. Companies like Walgreens and CVS Health, along with state governments in Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania have been instrumental in this project, contributing data with extensive lists of public and private disposal locations. The DEA is already working with us to provide additional location data to expand the pilot.For this pilot, we also looked to public health authorities\u2014like HHS\u2014for ideas on how technology can help communities respond to the opioid crisis. In fact, combining disposal location data from different sources was inspired by a winning entry at the HHS\u2019s Opioid Code-A-Thon held a year ago.We\u2019ll be working to expand coverage and add more locations in the coming months.

Today, various laws provide detailed regulations, including Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in the United States and European Union\u2019s e-Commerce Directive.Google invests millions of dollars in technology and people to combat illegal content in an effective and fair way. It\u2019s a complex task, and\u2013just as in offline contexts\u2014it\u2019s not a problem that can be totally solved. Rather, it\u2019s a problem that must be managed, and we are constantly refining our practices.In addressing illegal content, we\u2019re also conscious of the importance of protecting legal speech. Context often matters when determining whether content is illegal. Consider a video of military conflict. In one context the footage might be documentary evidence of atrocities in areas where journalists have great difficulty and danger accessing. In another context the footage could be promotional material for an illegal organization. Even a highly trained reviewer could have a hard time telling the difference, and we need to get those decisions right across many different languages and cultures, and across the vast scale of audio, video, text, and images uploaded online. We make it easy to easily submit takedown notices; at the same time, we also create checks and balances against misuse of removal processes. And we look to the work of international agencies and principles from leading groups like the Global Network Initiative.A smart regulatory framework is essential to enabling an appropriate approach to illegal content. We wanted to share four key principles that inform our practices and that (we would suggest) make for an effective regulatory framework:\nShared Responsibility: Tackling illegal content is a societal challenge\u2014in which companies, governments, civil society, and users all have a role to play. Whether a company is alleging copyright infringement, an individual is claiming defamation, or a government is seeking removal of terrorist content, it\u2019s essential to provide clear notice about the specific piece of content to an online platform, and then platforms have a responsibility to take appropriate action on the specific content. In some cases, content may not be clearly illegal, either because the facts are uncertain or because the legal outcome depends on a difficult balancing act; in turn, courts have an essential role to play in fact-finding and reaching legal conclusions on which platforms can rely.\nRule of law and creating legal clarity: It\u2019s important to clearly define what platforms can do to fulfill their legal responsibilities, including removal obligations. An online platform that takes other voluntary steps to address illegal content should not be penalized. (This is sometimes called \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d protection.)Flexibility to accommodate new technology: While laws should accommodate relevant differences between platforms, given the fast-evolving nature of the sector, laws should be written in ways that address the underlying issue rather than focusing on existing technologies or mandating specific technological fixes.\u00a0Fairness and transparency: Laws should support companies\u2019 ability to publish transparency reports about content removals, and provide people with notice and an ability to appeal removal of content. They should also recognize that fairness is a flexible and context-dependent notion\u2014for example, improperly blocking newsworthy content or political expression could cause more harm than mistakenly blocking other types of content.\u00a0\nWith these principles in mind, we support refinement of notice-and-takedown regimes, but we have significant concerns about laws that would mandate proactively monitoring or filtering content, impose overly rigid timelines for content removal, or otherwise impose harsh penalties even on those acting in good faith. These types of laws create a risk that platforms won\u2019t take a balanced approach to content removals, but instead take a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d approach\u2014blocking content at upload or implementing a \u201ctake down first, ask questions later (or never)\u201d approach. We regularly receive overly broad removal requests, and analyses of cease-and-desist and takedown letters have found that many seek to remove potentially legitimate or protected speech.There\u2019s ample room for debate and nuance on these topics\u2014we discuss them every day\u2014and we\u2019ll continue to seek ongoing collaboration among governments, industry, and civil society on this front. Over time, an ecosystem of tools and institutions\u2014like the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, and the Internet Watch Foundation, which has taken down child sexual abuse material for more than two decades\u2014has evolved to address the issue. Continuing to develop initiatives like these and other multistakeholder efforts remains critical, and we look forward to progressing those discussions.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It was clear from the excitement at the event that the jobs and economic investment meant a great deal to the community. I\u2019ve seen that same optimism in communities around the country that are helping to power our digital economy. And I\u2019m proud to say that our U.S. footprint is growing rapidly: In the last year, we\u2019ve hired more than 10,000 people in the U.S. and made over $9 billion in investments. Our expansion across the U.S. has been crucial to finding great new talent, improving the services that people use every day, and investing in our business.Today we\u2019re announcing over $13 billion in investments throughout 2019 in data centers and offices across the U.S., with major expansions in 14 states. These new investments will give us the capacity to hire tens of thousands of employees, and enable the creation of more than 10,000 new construction jobs in Nebraska, Nevada, Ohio, Texas, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia. With this new investment, Google will now have a home in 24 total states, including data centers in 13 communities. 2019 marks the second year in a row we\u2019ll be growing faster outside of the Bay Area than in it. This growth will allow us to invest in the communities where we operate, while we improve the products and services that help billions of people and businesses globally. Our new data center investments, in particular, will enhance our ability to provide the fastest and most reliable services for all our users and customers. As part of our commitment to our 100 percent renewable energy purchasing, we\u2019re also making significant renewable energy investments in the U.S. as we grow. Our data centers make a significant economic contribution to local communities, as do the associated $5 billion in energy investments that our energy purchasing supports.Here\u2019s a closer look at the investments we\u2019re making state by state:\nMidwestWe\u2019re continuing to expand our presence in Chicago and are developing new data centers in Ohio and Nebraska. The Wisconsin office is set to move into a larger space in the next few months\u2014and last November we opened a Detroit office in Little Caesars Arena, where you can see into the space where the Detroit Red Wings play.\nGooglers and partners at our office opening in Detroit last November\nSouthWith new office and data center development, our workforce in Virginia will double. And with a new office in Georgia, our workforce will double there as well. Data centers in Oklahoma and South Carolina will expand, and we\u2019re developing a new office and data center in Texas.\nOpening one of our data centers last year.\nNortheastMassachusetts has one of our largest sales and engineering communities outside of the Bay Area, and we\u2019re building new office space there. In New York, the Google Hudson Square campus\u2014a major product, engineering and business hub\u2014will come to life over the next couple of years.\nWestWe\u2019ll open our first data center in Nevada and will expand our Washington office, a key product and engineering hub. In addition to investments in the Bay Area, our investments in California continue with the redevelopment of the Westside Pavillion, and the Spruce Goose Hangar in the Los Angeles area.\nGooglers at work. Our investments this year will go toward expansions in data centers and offices across the U.S.\nAll of this growth is only possible with our local partners.

Google and the future of software development", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/our-fight-protect-future-software-development/", "post_text": "Today we asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review our long-running copyright dispute with Oracle over the use of software interfaces. The outcome will have a far-reaching impact on innovation across the computer industry.Standardized software interfaces have driven innovation in software development. They let computer programs interact with each other and let developers easily build technologies for different platforms. Unless the Supreme Court steps in here, the industry will be hamstrung by court decisions finding that the use of software interfaces in creating new programs is not allowed under copyright law.With smartphone apps now common, we sometimes forget how hard it once was for developers to build apps across a wide range of different platforms. Our 2008 release of the open-source Android platform changed the game. It helped developers overcome the challenges of smaller processors, limited memory, and short battery life, while providing innovative features and functionality for smartphone development. The result was a win for everyone: Developers could build new apps, manufacturers could build great new devices, and the resulting competition gave consumers both lower prices and an extraordinary range of choice.We built Android following the computer industry\u2019s long-accepted practice of re-using software interfaces, which provide sets of commands that make it easy to implement common functionality\u2014in the same way that computer keyboard short-cuts like pressing \u201ccontrol\u201d and \u201cp\u201d make it easy to print. Android created a transformative new platform, while letting millions of Java programmers use their existing skills to create new applications. And the creators of Java backed the release of Android, saying that it had \u201cstrapped another set of rockets to the [Java] community\u2019s momentum.\u201dBut after it acquired Java in 2010, Oracle sued us for using these software interfaces, trying to profit by changing the rules of software development after the fact. Oracle\u2019s lawsuit claims the right to control software interfaces\u2014the building blocks of software development\u2014and as a result, the ability to lock in a community of developers who have invested in learning the free and open Java language.A court initially ruled that the software interfaces in this case are not copyrightable, but that decision was overruled. A unanimous jury then held that our use of the interfaces was a legal fair use, but that decision was likewise overruled. Unless the Supreme Court corrects these twin reversals, this case will end developers\u2019 traditional ability to freely use existing software interfaces to build new generations of computer programs for consumers. Just like we all learn to use computer keyboard shortcuts, developers have learned to use the many standard interfaces associated with different programming languages. Letting these reversals stand would effectively lock developers into the platform of a single copyright holder\u2014akin to saying that keyboard shortcuts can work with only one type of computer.The U.S. Constitution authorized copyrights to \u201cpromote the progress of science and useful arts,\u201d not to impede creativity or promote lock-in of software platforms. Leading voices from business, technology, academia, and the nonprofit sector agree and have spoken out about the potentially devastating impacts of this case.We support software developers\u2019 ability to develop the applications we all have come to use every day, and we hope that the Supreme Court will give this case the serious and careful consideration it deserves. \u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nDevelopers\n  "}

We believe that AI, used appropriately, can deliver great benefit for economies and society, and help people to make decisions that are fairer, safer, and more inclusive and informed.As with other technologies, there are new policy questions that arise with the use of AI, and governments and civil society groups worldwide have a key role to play in the AI governance discussion. In a white paper we\u2019re publishing today, we outline five areas where government can work with civil society and AI practitioners to provide important guidance on responsible AI development and use: explainability standards, fairness appraisal, safety considerations, human-AI collaboration and liability frameworks.There are many trade-offs within each of these areas and the details are paramount for responsible implementation. For example, how should explainability and the need to hold an algorithm accountable be balanced with safeguarding the security of the system against hackers, protecting proprietary information and the desire to make AI experiences user-friendly? How should benchmarks and testing to ensure the safety of an AI system be balanced with the potential safety costs of not using the system?No one company, country, or community has all the answers; on the contrary, it\u2019s crucial for policy stakeholders worldwide to engage in these conversations. In the majority of cases, general legal frameworks and existing sector-specific processes will continue to provide an appropriate governance structure; for example, medical device regulations should continue to govern medical devices, regardless of whether AI is used in the device or not. However, in cases where additional oversight is needed, we hope this paper can help to promote pragmatic and forward-looking \u201crules of the road\u201d and approaches to governance that keep pace with changing attitudes and technology.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

As 2019 begins, I\u2019d like to share my thoughts on these important discussions and why Google supports smart regulation and other innovative ways to address emerging issues.We\u2019ve always been (and still are) fundamentally optimistic about the power of innovative technology. We\u2019re proud that Google\u2019s products and services empower billions of people, drive economic growth and offer important tools for your everyday life. This takes many forms, whether it\u2019s instant access to the world\u2019s information, an infinite gallery of sortable photos, tools that let you share documents and calendars with friends, directions that help you avoid traffic jams, or whatever Google tool you find most helpful.But this optimism doesn\u2019t obscure the challenges we face\u2014including those posed by misuse of new technologies. New tools inevitably affect not just the people and businesses who use them, but also cultures, economies and societies as a whole. We\u2019ve come a long way from our days as a scrappy startup, and with billions of people using our services every day, we recognize the need to confront tough issues regarding technology's broader impacts.The scrutiny of lawmakers and others often improves our products and the policies that govern them. It\u2019s sometimes claimed that the internet is an unregulated \u201cwild west,\u201d but that's just not the case. Many laws and regulations have contributed to the internet\u2019s vitality: competition and consumer protection laws, advertising regulations, and copyright, to name just a few. Existing legal frameworks reflect trade-offs that help everyone reap the benefits of modern technologies, minimize social costs, and respect fundamental rights. As technology evolves, we need to stay attuned to how best to improve those rules.In some cases, laws do need updates, as we laid out in our recent post on data protection and our proposal regarding law enforcement access to data. In other cases, collaboration among industry, government, and civil society may lead to complementary approaches, like joint industry efforts to fight online terrorist content, child sexual abuse material, and copyright piracy. Shared concerns can also lead to ways to empower people with new tools and choices, like helping people control and move their data\u2014that\u2019s why we have been a leader since 2007 in developing data portability tools and last year helped launch the cross-company Data Transfer Project.We don\u2019t see smart regulation as a singular end state; it must develop and evolve. In an era (and a sector) of rapid change, one-size-fits-all solutions are unlikely to work out well. Instead, it's important to start with a focus on a specific problem and seek well-tailored and well-informed solutions, thinking through the benefits, the second-order impacts, and the potential for unintended side-effects.Efforts to address illegal and harmful online content illustrate how tech companies can help support this process:First, to support constructive transparency, we launched our Transparency Report more than eight years ago, and we have continued to extend our transparency efforts over time, most recently with YouTube\u2019s Community Guidelines enforcement report. Second, to cultivate best practices for responsible content removals, we\u2019ve supported initiatives like the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, where tech companies, governments and civil society have worked together to stop exploitation of online services.Finally, we have participated in government-overseen systems of accountability. For instance, the EU\u2019s Hate Speech Code of Conduct includes an audit process to monitor how platforms are meeting our commitments. And in the recent EU Code of Practice On Disinformation, we agreed to help researchers study this topic and to engage in regular reporting and assessment of our next steps in this fight.While the world is no longer at the start of the Information Revolution, the most important and exciting chapters are still to come. Google has pioneered a number of new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and published a set of principles\u00a0to guide our work and inform the larger public debate about the use of these remarkable technologies. We\u2019ll have more to say about issues in AI governance in the coming weeks. Of course, every new breakthrough will raise its own set of new issues\u2014and we look forward to hearing from others and sharing our own thoughts and ideas.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Just last week, the tragic murder of Christmas shoppers in Strasbourg was a sobering reminder that terrorist attacks can happen at any time. What is clear from such attacks is that we all\u2014government, industry, and civil society\u2014have to remain vigilant and work together to address this continuing threat. While governments and civil society groups face a complex challenge in deterring terrorist violence, collaboration across the industry to responsibly address terrorist content online is delivering progress. And more tech companies must join the fight against terrorist content online.In June 2017 senior representatives from Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube came together to form the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT), a coalition to share information on how to best curb the spread of terrorism online. I\u2019ve had the responsibility of chairing this Forum for its initial a year and a half, and I\u2019m pleased to report that the Forum has helped to deliver significant results across a number of areas. In September 2017 at the United Nations General Assembly, I joined the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, and Italy to discuss what more the tech industry could do to combat terrorist content. I was there on behalf of the GIFCT member companies to present our commitments to tackle terrorism online: We collectively pledged to develop and share technology to responsibly address terrorist content across the industry; to fund research and share good practices that help all companies stay abreast of the latest trends; and to elevate positive counter messages. \u00a0We understand that we must responsibly lead the way in developing new technologies and standards for identifying and removing harmful terrorist content. As EU Commissioner Avromopolis said: \u201cThe tools you are developing yourselves on your platforms are the most effective counter-measures we all have. That is why I am a strong supporter of your efforts under the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.\u201d A key pillar of GIFCT\u2019s work to drive progress is maintaining a shared database of digital fingerprints (hashes) of known terrorist content that lets any member of the coalition automatically find and remove identical terrorist content on their platforms. In 2018, we set\u2014and achieved\u2014an ambitious goal of depositing 100k new hashes in the database.Over the past year and a half, we\u2019ve also engaged smaller businesses around the world to discuss their unique needs and to share ways to responsibly address terrorist content online. With the UN\u2019s counterterrorism directorate and the UN-initiated TechAgainstTerrorism program, we\u2019ve worked with more than 100 tech companies on four continents. We also convened forums in Europe, the Asia Pacific region, and Silicon Valley for companies, civil society groups, and governments to share experiences and get suggestions for further efforts. To enhance our understanding of the latest trends in online terrorist propaganda, GIFCT has been working with a research network led by the Royal United Services Institute. We are speaking with its network of eight think tanks around the world about how terrorist networks operate online, the ethics of content moderation, and the interplay between online content and offline actions. That network will publish ten academic papers over the next six months to benefit everyone working on the problem of terrorist content online. We\u2019ve also successfully worked alongside governments and Internet Referral Units, like Europol to get terrorist content down even more quickly. With civil society organizations, we\u2019ve developed a tool that will help them mount counter extremism campaigns across many online platforms at once. And together with Google.org, we launched a $5 million innovation fund to counter hate and extremism. The fund gives grants to nonprofits that are countering hate, both online and off. Our \u00a31M pilot program in the UK received over 230 applications, and we awarded grants to 22 initiatives.These are significant developments for the industry, but we know we have much more to do. The Forum will continue to expand our membership, vastly increase the size of our database of hashes, and do even more to help small companies and academic websites responsibly address terrorist content. We can never be complacent against the continuing threat of terrorism. The work being done today by our coalition members has helped limit the use of our platforms by terrorist organizations, and we have extended an open invitation to others in the industry to join with us in this effort.

Now a great-grandmother, Johnson was sentenced to life in prison without parole for a first-time, non-violent drug felony in 1997. She had spent over two decades behind bars when her story gained national attention\u2014prompting President Trump to officially reduce Johnson\u2019s sentence and send her home free earlier this year. Johnson\u2019s case set off a long-overdue debate around the country about harsh sentencing laws and the need to reform our criminal justice system.We\u2019ve long supported efforts to end mass incarceration and help individuals like Johnson get a second chance. In 2017, we collaborated on a YouTube video in which Johnson urged the public from her prison cell to advocate for the release of those serving life sentences for nonviolent offenses. We later partnered with Mic.com to produce a digital op-ed, which caught the attention of Kim Kardashian West and inspired her to take up Johnson\u2019s cause.America\u2019s thirty-year experiment with mandatory minimum sentences and sweeping criminalization has too often imposed unfair and disproportionate penalties on people across the country. As a former prosecutor, I have witnessed many individuals and families bear the consequences of these policies\u2014policies that haven\u2019t made us any safer, but have cost millions in taxpayer dollars and cast a pall over many lives.This week, Congress\u2014in a rare show of bipartisan consensus\u2014passed the First Step Act, changing these policies and reforming our criminal justice system. The legislation lowers mandatory minimum sentences for drug felonies, reduces the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses, and gives judges the discretion to shorten mandatory minimum sentences for low-level crimes. President Trump has already expressed support for the bill, and we look forward to him quickly signing it into law.The Act marks an important step forward in restoring equal justice and due process, and promoting consistency and fairness in sentencing. Moreover, the Act includes measures that will bolster rehabilitation programs in prisons across the country to help incarcerated women and men successfully re-enter society, reduce recidivism rates, and make our communities safer.Google.org has long backed these kinds of efforts to improve our criminal justice system. We\u2019ve supported work by non-profits promoting reform and by police departments working to improve interactions with their communities. We have promoted the use of data to increase the transparency of our criminal justice system. And we have launched programs like our digital LoveLetters initiative, which supports children with imprisoned parents.\u00a0\u00a0While we\u2019re encouraged by the passage of the First Step Act, there is still more work to be done at the federal, state, and local level to improve our criminal justice system. And we all have a part to play. As an example, our company policies seek to promote fair hiring by \u201cbanning the box\u201d (requiring job applicants to disclose criminal history only once they get a chance to interview) and encouraging our suppliers to do the same. And we don\u2019t accept ads for bail bonds, an industry with an unfortunate history of predatory practices.We look forward to continuing to work with people from many backgrounds and across a spectrum of views, united in our belief that America\u2019s legal and criminal justice systems can and should be an example to the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It might seem like they\u2019re unrelated, but technology like AI contributes to your everyday life, including the food you eat. Farmers around the world are using AI-infused apps like FARMWAVE and PlantVillage to diagnose and treat pests that might otherwise destroy an entire harvest.We\u2019re working to make it easier for anyone to manage and learn from data\u2014like allowing developers to use machine learning with TensorFlow and models we\u2019ve released on GitHub. Today, Google has over 2,000 open source projects. In the food space, our open source tools have supported the development of programs that sort cucumbers and track and monitor the health of dairy cows.But we wanted to learn even more about how technology is influencing our food. That's why over the last year, we\u2019ve met with experts across the nation\u2019s food supply chain to discuss and co-author the Refresh: Food + Tech, from Soil to Supper report. The report covers the important role technology plays in the production, distribution and consumption of our food. After working on the report over the past year, two major themes became clear.\n10:25\nWatch the full Refresh launch event at the link above.\nTechnological breakthroughs happen everywhereWe recently hosted a launch event in Chicago where we were joined by former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, who worked at the USDA during a dynamic time for technology in agriculture. At the time, precision farming and other smart-farm tech were changing the agricultural landscape\u2014but in many ways, these emerging technologies are a natural fit with life on the farm. Secretary Vilsack observed parallels between the farm and Silicon Valley, noting that innovation and risk-taking are inherent in the business of farming as well.\nFormer Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack talks about technology in agriculture with Danielle Nierenberg of Food Tank\nExamples of using technology on a farm run the gamut, from automated data analytics to wearables. For example, Refresh Working Group member Melissa Brandao created HerdDogg, a health tracking wearable for cows, to help dairy farmers monitor the day-to-day health of each individual cow in their herd. And working group member Amanda Ramcharan uses plant-spotting drones to evaluate soil health and predict weather patterns that help to inform standards for agricultural sustainability.Diverse perspectives are crucialFor new technologies to improve the food supply chain, we have to make sure that a variety of communities and stakeholders are involved in the process from the start. If AI is meant to be a useful tool for food production, distribution and consumption, these systems must be designed to meet the day-to-day needs of farmers, retailers and food workers.\nPanel discussion with myself from Google, Don Bustos of Santa Cruz Farm, Danielle Nierenberg of Food Tank and Ankita Raturi of the USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service\nFor example, technology has to be reliable in order for it to be useful for smaller operators. Don Bustos of Santa Cruz Farm in Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico was an early adopter of solar technologies for year-round food production. His community depends on his harvest as a critical food source, so he pointed out that any AI applications on his farm must be both affordable and reliable, or he risks a poor crop yield. And it has to bring people with diverse perspectives together to work toward new solutions. Refresh Working Group member Craig Ganssle, who created the communication platform FARMWAVE, understands that community is critical to the success of any technology. This platform provides farmers with a real-time community of peers worldwide, so that they can pool their expertise and learn from one another as they make critical decisions on their farms.We couldn\u2019t have learned about the complexities of our nation\u2019s food system without the participation of this engaged group of farmers, small business owners, researchers, nonprofit leaders and community organizers. Sign up for updates to join the conversation next year, and be the first to learn about our next event at SXSW 2019.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nSustainability\n  "}

A key part of preserving this creative economy is ensuring creators and artists have a way to share and make money from their content\u2014and preventing the flow of money to those who seek to pirate that content. Today, we're releasing our latest update on those efforts..Our 2018 \"How Google Fights Piracy\" report explains the programs, policies, and technology we put in place to combat piracy online and ensure continued opportunities for creators around the world.We invest significantly in the technology, tools and resources that prevent copyright infringement on our platforms. We also work with others across the industry on efforts to combat piracy. These efforts appear to be having an effect: around the world, online piracy has been decreasing, while spending on legitimate content is rising across content categories.Here are a few of our findings from this year's Piracy report:$3 billion+: The amount YouTube has paid to rights holders who have monetized use of their content in other videos through Content ID, our industry-leading rights management tool.$100 million+: The amount we\u2019ve invested in building Content ID, including staffing and computing resources.$1.8 billion+: The amount YouTube paid to the music industry from October 2017 to September 2018 in advertising revenue alone3 billion+: The number of URLs that were removed from Search for infringing copyright since launching a submission tool for copyright owners and their agents.10 million+: The number of ads that were disapproved by Google in 2017 that were suspected of copyright infringement or that linked to infringing sites.As we continue our work in the years ahead, five principles guide our substantial investments in fighting piracy:Create more and better legitimate alternatives: Piracy often arises when it's difficult for consumers to access legitimate content. By developing products that make it easy for users to access legitimate content, like Google Play Music and YouTube, Google helps drive revenue for creative industries and give consumers choice.Follow the money: As the vast majority of sites dedicated to online piracy are doing so to make money, one way to combat them is to cut off their supply. We prevent actors that engage in copyright infringement from using our ads and monetization systems and we enforce these policies rigorously.Be efficient, effective, and scalable: We strive to implement anti-piracy solutions that work at scale. For example, as early as 2010, we began making substantial investments in streamlining the copyright removal process for search results. As a result, these improved procedures allow us to process copyright removal requests for search results at the rate of millions per week.Guard against abuse: Some actors will make false copyright infringement claims in order to have content they don't want online taken down. We\u2019re committed to detecting and rejecting bogus infringement allegations, such as removals for political or competitive reasons.Provide transparency: We\u2019re committed to providing transparency. In our Transparency Report, we disclose the number of requests we receive from copyright owners and governments to remove information from our services.Today, our services are generating more revenue for creators and rights holders, connecting more people with the content they love, and doing more to fight back against online piracy than ever before. We\u2019re proud of the progress this report represents. Through continued innovation and partnership, we\u2019re committed to curtailing infringement by bad actors while empowering the creative communities who make many of the things we love about the internet today.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nYouTube\n  \nSearch\n  \nAds\n  "}

Across the nation, people are disposing of their leftover, unneeded prescription drugs at local Take Back events to prevent drug misuse. Google has partnered with the DEA to make these locations easier to find.\u00a0Visit g.co/rxtakeback\u00a0to find a location near you and make a plan to bring back your prescriptions.Earlier this year, Google.org gave $750,000 to the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids to expand and improve our Parent Helpline that supports parents and other caregivers of young people struggling with substance use. As the mother of a child in recovery, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how opioid addiction hurts our loved ones, families and our communities. I also work with the Partnership to help educate about opioid use and addiction, and I volunteer as a Parent Coach \u2013 providing peer-to-peer support to other families.Today I'm sharing some of the most frequently asked questions I hear from parents about opioid addiction.Aren\u2019t opioids legally prescribed by doctors, and therefore safe?Even though opioid pain relievers can be prescribed by doctors to manage pain, opioids have high risks of addiction and dependence.\u00a0While other pain relief options should be explored before taking opioids, when taken as prescribed for short periods of time, opioid pain relievers may generally be safe for most adults. But because opioid pain relievers (which have the same properties as heroin) can produce a sensation of euphoria in addition to pain relief, some people take them for longer stretches and increase the dosage over time \u2013 which can lead to addiction.What can I do, right now, to keep my family safe?Ask your doctor about alternatives to opioids to manage pain.Secure all of the medication in your home.Make sure that medications for you and your loved ones are used only as prescribed, and not shared with anyone else,Dispose of unused or expired medications at a Take Back location this weekend. Enter your zip code or address into the map here and find a local take-back facility.\nBut my child isn\u2019t using opioid drugs \u2013 why do I need to clean my medicine cabinet?When surveyed, more than half of teens say that it\u2019s easy to get prescription drugs from their parent\u2019s medicine cabinet, and two-thirds of teens who report misusing Rx medication get it from friends, family and acquaintances. While it\u2019s tempting to keep old prescriptions around \u201cin case you need them later,\u201d it\u2019s safer to dispose of them when the immediate need is over. Proper medication storage and disposal can help prevent misuse even beyond your own family.How can I talk to my child about drug misuse?While a majority of kids report that their parents have talked to them about avoiding alcohol (81%) or marijuana (80%), only 18% of kids say that their parents have talked to them about prescription drug use. Kids who learn about the dangers of drug use early and often are much less likely to develop addiction than those who do not receive these important messages at home. Conversations about the importance of using medications as prescribed, including not sharing medications or taking anything that hasn\u2019t been prescribed to oneself, are critical messages to convey.\u00a0Learn more\u00a0tips for talking about medication misuse.What signs should I be on the lookout for?Signals range from the obvious, like missing prescriptions and empty pill bottles, to subtler signs like sudden mood changes, isolating from family or friends, and losing interest in hobbies that used to bring joy. Early use can sometimes bring about positive behavior and moods, like being overly motivated or having lively conversations.Opioid addiction can also manifest in physical ways: Look for signs of fatigue and drowsiness, pinpoint pupils and dark circles under the eyes, and rapid weight loss.\u00a0Learn more\u00a0about opioid medication, including common signs of misuse.\u00a0\u00a0What do I do if I find out my child is misusing or abusing opioids?It can be scary to learn that your child is misusing opioids, but there are steps you can take to help:Learn about tools\u00a0to help motivate your child to get treatment.Start a conversation, not a confrontation, and always remember to listen.Consider your\u00a0treatment options, including medications that can help reduce cravings associated with opioids.As a safety precaution, you can talk to your doctor or pharmacist about getting\u00a0Naloxone\u00a0(known by the brand name Narcan) which is used to reverse an opioid overdose.When I found out my child was misusing opioids, I was scared and felt alone\u2014and felt like I had nowhere to turn.\u00a0But parents and families don\u2019t have to face this alone.\u00a0Compassionate, one-on-one support and guidance are within reach. You can connect with a Helpline Specialist at the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids by calling 1-855-DRUGFREE. You can also contact us by text (send a message to 55753) or email at our website at\u00a0drugfree.org.If you are an adult who is personally struggling with addiction, or you\u2019d like information on how to help a loved one, you can find opioid addiction resources through the Federal SAMHSA Helpline: 1-800-662-HELP.\u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle Earth\n  "}

Patent applicants should submit detailed disclosures describing their inventions and actively participate in the examination process to define clear distinctions between their inventions and existing technology. Examiners reviewing patent applications should conduct thorough searches of existing technology, reject any attempts to patent existing technology, and develop a clear record of the differences between the patent claims and what came before. The more that the patent system supports and incentivizes these activities, the more reliable the rights that issue from patent offices will be, and the more those patents will promote innovation.A healthy patent system requires that patent applicants and examiners be able to find and access the best documentation of state-of-the-art technology. This documentation is often found in sources other than patents. Non-patent literature can be particularly hard to find and access in the software field, where it may take the form of user manuals, technical specifications, or product marketing materials. Without access to this information, patent offices may issue patents covering existing technology, or not recognize trivial extensions of published research, removing the public\u2019s right to use it and bringing the reliability of patent rights into question. To address this problem, academia and industry have worked together to launch the Prior Art Archive, created through a collaboration between the MIT Media Lab, Cisco and the USPTO, and hosted by MIT. The Prior Art Archive is a new, open access system that allows anyone to upload those hard-to-find technical materials and make them easily searchable by everyone.We\u2019re proud to support the Prior Art Archive, and have devoted significant resources to this and other important quality initiatives. The Prior Art Archive is searchable through Google Patents, \u00a0and all of the documents in the Archive have been labeled with Cooperative Patent Classification codes using Google\u2019s machine learning models. The labels are a feature we rolled out in Google Patents to help make the most relevant technical materials easier to find. We\u2019ve also recently launched a site accessible to the public and examiners, TDCommons, where companies can publish technical information they don\u2019t want to patent free of charge. \u00a0We\u2019re also excited to use AI and machine learning to take prior art searching to the next level. To this end, we\u2019ve recently created an open ecosystem, the Google Patents Public Datasets, to make large datasets available for empirical public policy, economics, and machine learning research. We\u2019re committed to developing and making available technology that improves patent quality, and ultimately strengthens our patent system.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

My team\u2019s goal is to help you enjoy the benefits of technology, while remaining in control of your privacy.This is an important time to take on this new role. Now, more than any other time I have worked in this field, there is real momentum to develop baseline rules of the road for data protection. Google welcomes this and supports comprehensive, baseline privacy regulation. People deserve to feel comfortable that all entities that use personal information will be held accountable for protecting it. And we believe that regulation can support a dynamic marketplace for businesses of all types and sizes.Today, we\u2019re sharing our view on the requirements, scope, and enforcement expectations that should be reflected in all responsible data protection laws. This framework is based on established privacy frameworks, as well as our experience providing services that rely on personal data and our work to comply with evolving data protection laws around the world. These principles help us evaluate new legislative proposals and advocate for responsible, interoperable and adaptable data protection regulations. How these principles are put into practice will shape the nature and direction of innovation. You can find more detail in this PDF.Sound practices combined with strong and balanced regulations can help provide individuals with confidence that they\u2019re in control of their personal information.

This effort is urgent in light of the central role of the Internet in today\u2019s world, growing security threats that transcend borders, and expectations of privacy that Internet users have in their online communications.In March, the U.S. Congress took the first step toward this realignment in enacting the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act. The CLOUD Act creates a legal framework that clarifies the scope of search warrants under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) executed by U.S. governmental entities. It also creates a mechanism for foreign governments to request communications content directly from U.S. companies, provided that those governments meet baseline privacy, due process, and human rights standards. The CLOUD Act represents the first significant update to ECPA since it was enacted in 1986, but it is only a first step. In the past eight years, we\u2019ve testified five times in support of legislation that would require governmental entities to obtain a search warrant in order to compel service providers to disclose the content of users\u2019 communications. The House of Representatives has passed legislation that would accomplish this objective\u2014the Email Privacy Act\u2014three times since 2016. \u00a0\u00a0The Senate still needs to act. Passage of the bill would be a landmark achievement, and it would reinforce a recent Supreme Court decision that underscores the importance of Fourth Amendment privacy protections in the digital age.\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Carpenter v. United States that the long-term tracking of cell-site location information is a search that requires the government to obtain a warrant under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Google, along with other technology companies, submitted an amicus brief in that case. We argued that storing data with a third-party service provider should not extinguish privacy protections under the Fourth Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed, rejecting the proposition that citizens deserve less privacy protection merely because they store data with third-party service providers.The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Carpenter, however, does not answer important policy questions about the standards governments should meet before they can compel the production of sensitive user data. While courts will continue to grapple with these issues, legislatures can and should update government access statutes to align the law with the legitimate and reasonable expectations of privacy that users have when they use third-party services. Legislatures, for example, should be revisiting government access laws to protect location information. Legislatures should also be delving more deeply into the burgeoning Internet of Things marketplace, where the application of existing government access laws is unclear and the growing use of Internet-connected devices (particularly in the home) raises important privacy questions.Policymakers shouldn\u2019t wait to address these important questions, or leave it to courts to interpret outdated laws, but should update privacy protections in light of how people use services in the digital era.

The decision ignores the fact that Android phones compete with iOS phones, something that 89 percent of respondents to the Commission\u2019s own market survey confirmed. It also misses just how much choice Android provides to thousands of phone makers and mobile network operators who build and sell Android devices; to millions of app developers around the world who have built their businesses with Android; and billions of consumers who can now afford and use cutting-edge Android smartphones.\u00a0\u00a0Today, because of Android, there are more than 24,000 devices, at every price point, from more than 1,300 different brands, including Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Swedish phone makers.\nThe phones made by these companies are all different, but have one thing in common\u2014the ability to run the same applications. This is possible thanks to simple rules that ensure technical compatibility, no matter what the size or shape of the device. No phone maker is even obliged to sign up to these rules\u2014they can use or modify Android in any way they want, just as Amazon has done with its Fire tablets and TV sticks.To be successful, open-source platforms have to painstakingly balance the needs of everyone that uses them. History shows that without rules around baseline compatibility, open-source platforms fragment, which hurts users, developers and phone makers. Android\u2019s compatibility rules avoid this, and help make it an attractive long-term proposition for everyone.Creating flexibility, choice and opportunity Today, because of Android, a typical phone comes preloaded with as many as 40 apps from multiple developers, not just the company you bought the phone from. If you prefer other apps\u2014or browsers, or search engines\u2014to the preloaded ones, you can easily disable or delete them, and choose other apps instead, including apps made by some of the 1.6 million Europeans who make a living as app developers.\nIn fact, a typical Android phone user will install around 50 apps themselves. Last year, over 94 billion apps were downloaded globally from our Play app store; browsers such as Opera Mini and Firefox have been downloaded more than 100 million times, UC Browser more than 500 million times.This is in stark contrast to how things used to be in the 1990s and early 2000s\u2014the dial-up age. Back then, changing the pre-installed applications on your computer, or adding new ones, was technically difficult and time-consuming. The Commission\u2019s Android decision ignores the new breadth of choice and clear evidence about how people use their phones today.A platform built for the smartphone eraIn 2007, we chose to offer Android to phone makers and mobile network operators for free. Of course, there are costs involved in building Android, and Google has invested billions of dollars over the last decade to make Android what it is today. \u00a0This investment makes sense for us because we can offer phone makers the option of pre-loading a suite of popular Google apps (such as Search, Chrome, Play, Maps and Gmail), some of which generate revenue for us, and all of which help ensure the phone \u2018just works\u2019, right out of the box. Phone makers don\u2019t have to include our services; and they\u2019re also free to pre-install competing apps alongside ours. This means that we earn revenue only if our apps are installed, and if people choose to use our apps instead of the rival apps.\nGood for partners, good for consumersThe free distribution of the Android platform, and of Google\u2019s suite of applications, is not only efficient for phone makers and operators\u2014it\u2019s of huge benefit for developers and consumers. If phone makers and mobile network operators couldn\u2019t include our apps on their wide range of devices, it would upset the balance of the Android ecosystem. So far, the Android business model has meant that we haven't had to charge phone makers for our technology, or depend on a tightly controlled distribution model.\u00a0\u00a0We\u2019ve always agreed that with size comes responsibility. A healthy, thriving Android ecosystem is in everyone\u2019s interest, and we\u2019ve shown we\u2019re willing to make changes. But we are concerned that today\u2019s decision will upset the careful balance that we have struck with Android, and that it sends a troubling signal in favor of proprietary systems over open platforms.\u00a0\u00a0Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them.\u00a0Today\u2019s decision rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less. We intend to appeal.\u00a0#AndroidWorks\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  \nAndroid\n  "}

They\u2019re the proud owners of Mason\u2019s Creamery, a thriving sweets shop. Just a few years ago, they were struggling to turn their ice cream cart into a permanent storefront business. After a long search, they found an old retail space in the Ohio City neighborhood and used online tutorials to learn how to refab the building. They helped draw foot traffic with a website and advertising. Today, their business is booming and people from all over the city come to try their cutting-edge ice cream. (I tried some\u2014really good!) Jesse and Helen aren\u2019t techies or coders, but they were able to use the internet to help them achieve their version of the American dream. We hear stories like Jesse and Helen's across the country, which is why we\u2019re fundamentally optimistic about new technology tools. They put knowledge at your fingertips, make daily life more efficient, and drive economic growth. In 2016 six percent of U.S. GDP came from internet companies, creating more than 10.4 million jobs across all 50 states\u2014the vast majority outside of Silicon Valley.But we need to do more to ensure more people benefit from tech advances. Access to opportunity is too often limited by background, geography, income level, or access to education. The reasons for this are complex\u2014globalization and trade continue to reshape markets, and we face major shifts in demographics and labor force participation. Rapid technological change and the growth of automation are also part of the story.Regardless of the mix of causes, we all have a responsibility to tackle these challenges, not just through public policy, but also through efforts by businesses, communities, and civil society groups.That is why alongside our products and services, Google invests in a variety of initiatives to help enhance economic opportunity for everyone, whether through Google.org or Grow with Google. We want our philanthropy and our investments to catalyze larger and more scalable community programs. We\u2019ve also started to work with the policy experts identifying public policies that can help successful approaches to grow across the country.As part of these efforts, we\u2019re releasing a new report\u2014Opportunity for Everyone\u2014that looks at economic opportunity across the United States. The report concentrates on how we can bridge gaps in education, entrepreneurship, and the social safety net.We\u2019re building on these ideas by piloting and testing different approaches to key challenges, through the products that we build, the programs we manage, and the philanthropy we support. As these initiatives show promise, we hope to work with policymakers as well as business and community leaders to help the best concepts scale. And where we don\u2019t see success, we\u2019ll be public about that as well, so that others can learn from the results. \u00a0The ideas aren\u2019t meant to be a holistic solution, but downpayments on places where we think smart policies and investments can have a big impact. We\u2019re approaching this issue knowing that we\u2018re not going to have all the solutions, but we\u2019re hoping to contribute where we can.If you happen to be in Cleveland, I recommend a visit to Mason\u2019s Creamery to hear from Jesse and Helen about how they were able to grow their business\u2014and try the candied pecan. Their story is inspiring. And there are millions of Jesses and Helens out there, dreaming of an ice cream shop or a quilting store or an after-school program for kids. It\u2019s up to all of us to make sure that everyone can access the opportunities that technology brings. We hope today's report can move us a step closer to that goal.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It\u2019s hard, time-consuming work, yet also vitally important. But what if the microscope itself could give the doctor a second opinion, in real time? This kind of \"virtual lab assistant\" is no longer a distant concept; it's already here. The Augmented Reality Microscope for Cancer Detection, the subject of a Google research paper this spring, is a machine learning capability integrated into standard laboratory microscopes. It overlays visual analysis on the image, highlighting areas of risk and potentially catching things the human eye may miss.This microscope is but one example of how new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics are changing the way tasks are done in the workplace, and in turn, the vast majority of existing jobs. In the future, healthcare professionals could spend less time running tests, and concentrate more on caring for patients. The trucker of the future may spend more time managing logistics at transfer hubs for self-driving trucks than behind the wheel\u2014which could also lead to an increase in jobs in the sector. In addition, new jobs are emerging. Across Europe Google is hiring hundreds of people for roles like Strategic Cloud Data Engineer, Android Relationship Lead, Big Data Product Specialist\u2014positions that would simply not have existed a decade ago. A report last year from the MIT Sloan Management Review identified whole new categories of jobs that AI will create: trainers, explainers, and sustainers. In these roles, humans will work with cognitive technology to ensure that machines are both effective and responsibly deployed.How Google is helping prepare for the future of workWe\u2019re optimistic about the impact of digital technology on the world of work, but we\u2019re not utopians. We understand change on this scale can be difficult, which is why we\u2019re investing in training and other solutions to address changes in the labor market. Workers also want to prepare for this change: Demand for training is high, and people of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels want to acquire new skills that will enable them to succeed in the digital world. \u00a0Our Grow with Google program aims to meet that demand with training workshops, direct mentoring and online courses. And it\u2019s already seeing results: graduates have gained vital digital skills, improved their CVs and expanded businesses online. More than half a million businesses have reported growth in revenue and customers thanks to the program. We\u2019ve trained 3 million people across Europe to date, and the next goal is to help 1 million Europeans find a job or grow their business by 2020.For those who want to take it to the next level, we partnered with Udacity and Bertelsmann to offer 10,000 scholarships in web development at beginner and advanced levels. We were so overwhelmed by demand we decided to support a further 60,000 scholarships to create a new generation of developers from diverse backgrounds.We\u2019re working with partners at the national level to ensure that we reach as many people as we can with these programs. For example, we\u2019re working closely with the Swedish Employment Agency on getting unemployed people learning digital skills through the Digital Me portal. And we\u2019re working with training providers to broaden out the curriculum for Grow with Google and include more soft skills such as entrepreneurship, creativity and leadership. Sharing insights with the OECDWe believe that the new world of work should be inclusive and accessible, and benefit society. And we want to play our role. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proud to join an initiative launched by the OECD in May to gather insight into how the evolving labor market can benefit everyone. \nThe OECD asked business and academia representatives to share insights into how the evolving labor market can benefit everyone. The stakeholder group was launched at the OECD Forum in May 2018.\nWe believe that a great place to start is learning from digital leaders. At a recent\u00a0Nordic conference on the future of work, the International Labour Organisation and the OECD suggested that the Nordic \u201cdigital frontrunner\u201d countries should be a sandbox for the coming technology transition. We agree, and have shared some concrete suggestions with the OECD for what could be done:We appreciate the power of data, so we believe there\u2019s a real need to gather good examples of workers and companies succeeding in a changing labor market, and to identify champions to ensure a future of work that works for everyone. A Future of Work observatory could address this.We need to be brave and create new solutions that protect workers, not jobs. We\u2019ve been impressed by\u00a0training vouchers, as recently initiated in Belgium and France\u2014where workers accumulate credits for training over time, then spend them when needed. A sector-specific approach could also make sense: those most affected, such as transport or manufacturing, \u00a0could benefit from a dedicated future of work taskforce.Educators are working on these issues, but they can\u2019t be expected to do this alone. We see a need for skills partnerships so that teachers, employers and governments have the right strategy for changing skills needs. Again, we should look at those already succeeding: the technology pacts between industry and government in the\u00a0Netherlands\u00a0and\u00a0Denmark\u00a0are great examples.That\u2019s a lot of work, in a lot of areas. It will take a huge effort to make it happen. But the potential return on investment for getting this right is massive. Companies, governments and civil society need to think upfront about preparing people for new jobs, skills and technologies.There\u2019s only one chance to prepare for the future of work. It\u2019s imperative that we all work together to get it right.This article was also published on the\u00a0OECD Forum Network.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Most women behind bars are mothers to minors, serving sentences for first time non-violent crimes. Mothers shared with me, in hushed voices, their suffering. I tried to document the abuses committed against them, shackling them during childbirth to sexual abuse by prison guards. I\u2019m still haunted by memories of very small children not being allowed to touch or kiss or hug their mothers during visits; by the little girl who told me she never knew the warmth of waking up to her mother next to her.That\u2019s why the chance to set up the Love Letters project at Google is so special to me. Two years ago,\u00a0I reached out to the community organizations I knew working with children of incarcerated parents. We partnered together to create Love Letters: digital love letters from children to their incarcerated parents for Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, a project we\u2019re continuing this year.Our commitment to justice reform has expanded in the past two years. In addition to our philanthropy, just this past week we banned bail bond ads from Search because of their predatory effect on vulnerable communities. Love Letters is yet another way we\u2019re using our different platforms to disrupt the human costs of mass incarceration.This Mother\u2019s Day, let\u2019s remember those mothers behind bars and the children left behind, and bear witness to the suffering that happens when we overcriminalize communities. These love letters are a testament to the unbroken bonds that endure between mothers and their children.

We\u2019ve been working on our compliance efforts for over eighteen months, and ahead of the new law coming into effect, here\u2019s an update on some of the key steps we've taken.Improved user transparencyWe\u2019re updating our current Privacy Policy to make it easier to understand what information we collect, and why we collect it. We\u2019ve improved the navigation and organization of the policy to make it easier to find what you\u2019re looking for; explained our practices in more detail and with clearer language; and added more detail about the options you have to manage, export, and delete data from our services. The policy now also includes explanatory videos and illustrations, because a visual description can be easier to understand than text alone. And we've made it easier to jump to your privacy settings directly from the policy, helping you make choices about your privacy.\n10:25\nAlthough we\u2019re taking these steps to make our Privacy Policy easier to understand, it\u2019s important to note that nothing is changing about your current settings or how your information is processed. You\u2019ll continue to have granular control over the data you share with us when you use our services, but with clearer explanations. The updated policy is already available to read and we\u2019ll be emailing all of our users about it individually.Improved user controlsEvery day, nearly 20 million people around the globe visit My Account, our central hub that brings together all the different ways you can review your Google security, privacy and ad settings. As part of our GDPR compliance efforts, we\u2019ve improved both the controls and the clarity of information in My Account so that people are better informed about how and why their data is collected. Within My Account, you can:\u00a0Use Activity Controls to choose what activity is saved to your Google Account. We provide simple on/off switches to control Location History, Web and App Activity, YouTube Search History and more, across all devices that are signed in to your account.View or delete data\u2014including search history, location history, browsing history\u2014from our services using My Activity. To make it easier to browse your past online activity, we have given you tools to search by topic, date, and product. You can permanently delete specific activities, entire days or weeks of activity that you don\u2019t want associated with your account.Take a Security Checkup or Privacy Checkup to reassure yourself that your account is secure, and that your privacy settings work for you. We\u2019ve recently added an option that allows you to subscribe to more frequent prompts to take the Privacy Checkup.Manage or mute the ads you see on Google, on websites and in apps using the recently upgraded Ads Settings tool and Mute This Ad control. We have provided more information about how and why certain ads are personalized, and will also be further simplifying the look and feel of these tools in the coming months.Get a clear overview of all the Google products that you use\u2014and the data associated with them\u2014via Google Dashboard. We\u2019ve recently made the Dashboard more mobile-friendly so it's now easy to use across different devices.Improved data portabilitySince its launch in 2011, people around the world have used our Download Your Data tool to export data from products like Google Photos, Drive, Calendar, Google Play Music and Gmail, either to their own computer, or to storage services like OneDrive, Dropbox and Box. We are further improving and expanding this feature, adding more Google services, including more contextual data controls, and creating a new setting that helps people schedule regular downloads.\nWhile we\u2019ve enabled people to download data from our services for many years, the GDPR encourages companies to enable direct service-to-service data transfers where feasible, for example from Google Photos to another photo service. To support that aim, we've recently initiated the Data Transfer Project on GitHub, providing early-stage open source code that will, in time, be of use to any developer wanting to offer seamless transfer of data from one service directly into an alternative (or vice versa).Parental consent and improved tools for children onlineUnder the new rules, companies must get consent from parents to process their children\u2019s data in certain circumstances. To obtain that consent and to make sure that parents and children have the tools to manage their online experiences, we\u2019re rolling out Family Link\u2014already available in various countries around the world\u2014throughout the EU. Through Family Link, parents can create a Google Account for their child and are required to provide consent for certain processing of their child\u2019s data. Family Link also allows parents to set certain digital ground rules on their child\u2019s Android device\u2014like approving or blocking apps, keeping an eye on screen time, or remotely locking their child\u2019s device. We plan to evolve Family Link\u2019s functionality over time, working closely with parents and advocacy groups. Helping our business customers and partnersThe GDPR places new obligations on Google, but also on any business providing services to people in the EU. That includes our partners around the globe: advertisers, publishers, developers and cloud customers. We\u2019ve been working with them to prepare for May 25, consulting with regulators, civil society groups, academics, industry groups and others. For our advertising partners, we\u2019ve clarified how our advertising policies will change when the GDPR takes effect. We already ask publishers to get consent from their users for the use of our ad tech on their sites and apps under existing legislation, but we\u2019ve now updated that requirement in line with GDPR guidance. We\u2019re also working closely with our publisher partners to provide a range of tools to help them gather user consent, and have built a solution for publishers that want to show non-personalized ads, using only contextual information. For our Google Cloud customers, we\u2019ve updated our data processing terms for G Suite and Google Cloud Platform and provided detailed information to customers about our approach to data portability, data incident notifications, secure infrastructure and third party audits and certifications, among other features. For more information, see\u00a0this post on Google Cloud.Strengthening our privacy compliance programOver the last decade, Google has built a strong global privacy compliance program, taking advice from regulators around the world. Across the company, we have dedicated teams of engineers and compliance experts who work in full-time privacy roles, ensuring that no Google product launches without a comprehensive privacy review. We\u2019ve now further improved our privacy program, enhancing our product launch review processes, and more comprehensively documenting our processing of data, in line with the accountability requirements of the GDPR.This is a snapshot of things we\u2019ve done to date to be ready for May 25, 2018. But our commitment to compliance with the GDPR, and the rights it gives people, will continue long beyond this date. As we evolve our products over time, we\u2019ll continue to improve our Privacy Program and the protections we offer to users. Our ambition is to have the highest possible standards of data security and privacy, and to put our users and partners in control.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

This week, we\u2019re rolling out new policies for U.S. election ads across our platforms as we work to meet those commitments.As a first step, we\u2019ll now require additional verification for anyone who wants to purchase an election ad on Google in the U.S. and require that advertisers confirm they are a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, as required by law. That means advertisers will have to provide a government-issued ID and other key information. To help people better understand who is paying for an election ad, we\u2019re also requiring that ads incorporate a clear disclosure of who is paying for it.\u00a0\u00a0There's more to come. This summer, we\u2019ll also release a new Transparency Report specifically focused on election ads.

We\u2019re investing heavily in keeping our own platforms secure and working with campaigns, elections officials, journalists, and others to help ensure the security of the online platforms that they depend on. In addition to the industry-leading protections in our consumer products, we\u2019ve developed a range of Protect Your Election tools with Alphabet\u2019s Jigsaw that are specifically tailored for people who are at particularly high risk of online attacks.Yesterday, we announced improvements to one such product. Google\u2019s Advanced Protection Program, our strongest level of account security for those who face increased risk of sophisticated phishing attacks sent to their email address, now supports Apple\u2019s native applications on iOS devices, including Apple Mail, Calendar and Contacts. We expect this will help more campaigns and officials who are often the targets of sophisticated phishing attacks.We are also working across the industry and beyond to strengthen protections around elections. We\u2019ve partnered with the National Cyber Security Alliance and Digital Democracy Project at the Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School to fund security training programs for elected officials, campaigns, and staff members. We are also supporting the\u00a0\u201cDisinfo Lab\u201d\u00a0at the\u00a0Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center, which will employ journalists to leverage computational tools to monitor misinformation in the run-up to and during elections.For over a decade we\u2019ve built products that provide information about elections around the world, to help voters make decisions on the leadership of their communities, their cities, their states and their countries. We are continuing that work through our efforts to increase election advertising transparency, to improve online security for campaigns and candidates, and to help combat misinformation. \u00a0Stay tuned for more announcements in the coming months.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAds\n  \nCivics\n  "}

We started by thinking about how to bring Google\u2019s technical expertise to help families combat the epidemic.Research by the federal government has shown that prescription drug abuse is a large driver of opioid addiction, and that the majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family or friends, often from a home medicine cabinet. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has found that one way that Americans can help prevent drug abuse and addiction is to properly dispose of unneeded or expired prescription drugs. Yet many people aren\u2019t aware of, or can\u2019t easily find, prescription drug disposal programs in their communities. Using Google Maps API, our team worked with the DEA to create a locator tool for the National Prescription Drug Take Back Day this Saturday, April 28. The locator tool can help anyone find a place near them to safely dispose of leftover prescription medications. Click on the image below to access the locator, and enter an address or zip code to find nearby Take Back Day events this Saturday and help fight the opioid epidemic.\nLonger term, we\u2019re working with the DEA and state governments like Iowa, Arizona, Massachusetts, and Michigan to gather data on year-round take back options for future Google Maps integration.In addition to making it easier to find take back locations, we\u2019re also proud to support non-profit organizations on the frontlines of this crisis. We\u2019ve worked with the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids\u00a0since 2015 to help parents searching online for support connect to the Partnership\u2019s \u00a0Parent Helpline.

In deciding what to delist, search engines like Google must consider if the information in question is \u201cinaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant or excessive\u201d\u2014and whether there is a public interest in the information remaining available in search results. Understanding how we make these types of decisions\u2014and how people are using new rights like those granted by the European Court\u2014is important. Since 2014, we\u2019ve provided information about \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d delisting requests in our Transparency Report, including the number of URLs submitted to us, the number of URLs delisted and not delisted, and anonymized examples of some of the requests we have received. New data in the Transparency ReportToday, we\u2019re expanding the scope of our transparency reporting about the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and adding new data going back to January 2016 when our reviewers started manually annotating each URL submitted to us with additional information, including:Requesters: We show a breakdown of the requests made by private individuals vs. non-private individuals\u2014e.g., government officials or corporate entities.Content of the request: We classify the content that the individual has asked us to delist into a set of categories: personal information, professional information, crime, and name not found, meaning that we were not able to find the individual\u2019s name on the page. Content of the site: When we evaluate a URL for potential delisting, we classify the website that hosts the page as a directory site, news site, social media, or other. Content delisting rate: This is the rate at which we delist content by category on a quarterly basis. Looking back: analyzing three years of delisting requestsIn addition to updating the Transparency Report, we\u2019re also providing a snapshot of our efforts to process these requests over the last three years.\nWe\u2019re also releasing the draft of a new research paper called Three Years of the Right to be Forgotten, which has been submitted to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium for peer review. This paper uses our manual reviewers\u2019 annotations to provide a comprehensive analysis of the ways Europeans are using the \u201cright to be forgotten.\u201dWe hope the new data we\u2019ve added to the Transparency Report and our research paper will help inform the ongoing discussion about the interplay between the right to privacy and the right to access lawful information online.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Our goal has always been to make this information as accessible as possible, and to continue expanding this report with new and relevant data.Today, we\u2019re announcing three updates to our Transparency Report. We\u2019re expanding the National Security Letters (NSL) section, releasing new data on requests from governments to remove content from services like YouTube and Blogger, and making it easier for people to share select data and charts from the Transparency Report.National Security LettersFollowing the 2015 USA Freedom Act, the FBI started lifting indefinite gag restrictions\u2014prohibitions against publicly sharing details\u2014on particular NSLs. Last year, we began publishing NSLs we have received where, either through litigation or legislation, we have been freed of these nondisclosure obligations. We have added a new subsection to the NSL page of the Transparency Report where we publish these letters. We also added letters to the collection, and look to update this section regularly.Government requests for content removalsAs usage of our services increases, we remain committed to keeping internet users safe, working with law enforcement to remove illegal content, and complying with local laws. During this latest reporting period, we\u2019ve continued to expand our work with local law enforcement. From January to June 2017, we received 19,176 requests from governments around the world to remove 76,714 pieces of content. This was a 20 percent percent increase in removal requests over the second half of 2016.Making our Transparency Report easier to useFinally, we\u2019ve implemented a new \u201cdeep linking\u201d feature that makes it easier to bookmark and share specific charts in the Transparency Report. Sorting data by country, time period, and other categories now generates a distinct web address at the top of your browser window. This allows you to create a link that will show, for example, just government removals data in France, by Google product, for the first half of 2015. We hope this will make it easier for citizens to find and reference information in the report, and for journalists and researchers to highlight specific details that they may be examining as well.By continuing to make updates like these, we aim to spark new conversations about transparency, accountability and the role of governments and companies in the flow of information online.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Over the past year, we have formalized this partnership with the launch of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). We hosted our first meeting in August where representatives from the tech industry, government and non-governmental organizations came together to focus on three key areas: technological approaches, knowledge sharing, and research. Since then, we have participated in a Heads of State meeting at the UN General Assembly in September and the G7 Interior Ministers meeting in October, and we look forward to hosting a GIFCT event and attending the EU Internet Forum in Brussels on the 6th of December.The GIFCT is committed to working on technological solutions to help thwart terrorists' use of our services, and has built on the groundwork laid by the EU Internet Forum, particularly through a shared industry hash database, where companies can create \u201cdigital fingerprints\u201d for terrorist content and share it with participating companies. The database, which we announced our commitment to building last December and became operational last spring, now contains more than 40,000 hashes. It allows member companies to use those hashes to identify and remove matching content \u2014 videos and images \u2014 that violate our respective policies or, in some cases, block terrorist content before it is even posted. We are pleased that Ask.fm, Cloudinary, Instagram, Justpaste.it, LinkedIn, Oath, and Snap have also recently joined this hash-sharing consortium, and we will continue our work to add additional companies throughout 2018.In order to disrupt the distribution of terrorist content across the internet, companies have invested in collaborating and sharing expertise with one another. GIFCT's knowledge-sharing work has grown quickly in large measure because companies recognize that in countering terrorism online we face many of the same challenges. Although our companies have been sharing best practices around counterterrorism for several years, in recent months GIFCT has provided a more formal structure to accelerate and strengthen this work. In collaboration with the Tech Against Terror initiative \u2014 which recently launched a Knowledge Sharing Platform with the support of GIFCT and the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate \u2014 we have held workshops for smaller tech companies in order to share best practices on how to disrupt the spread of violent extremist content online. Our initial goal for 2017 was to work with 50 smaller tech companies to to share best practices on how to disrupt the spread of violent extremist material. We have exceeded that goal, engaging with 68 companies over the past several months through workshops in San Francisco, New York, and Jakarta, plus another workshop next week in Brussels on the sidelines of the EU Internet Forum. We recognize that our work is far from done, but we are confident that we are heading in the right direction. We will continue to provide updates as we forge new partnerships and develop new technology in the face of this global challenge\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  \nYouTube\n  "}

From the outset, we have publicly stated our concerns about the ruling, but we have still worked hard to comply\u2014and to do so conscientiously and in consultation with Data Protection Authorities. To date, we\u2019ve handled requests to delist nearly 2 million search results in Europe, removing more than 800,000 of them. We have also taken great care not to erase results that are clearly in the public interest, as the European Court of Justice directed. Most Data Protection Authorities have concluded that this approach strikes the right balance. But two right to be forgotten cases now in front of the European Court of Justice threaten that balance.In the first case, four individuals\u2014who we can\u2019t name\u2014present an apparently simple argument: European law protects sensitive personal data; sensitive personal data includes information about your political beliefs or your criminal record; so all mentions of criminality or political affiliation should automatically be purged from search results, without any consideration of public interest.If the Court accepted this argument, it would give carte blanche to people who might wish to use privacy laws to hide information of public interest\u2014like a politician\u2019s political views, or a public figure\u2019s criminal record. This would effectively erase the public\u2019s right to know important information about people who represent them in society or provide them services.In the second case, the Court must decide whether Google should enforce the right to be forgotten not just in Europe, but in every country around the world. We\u2014and a wide range of human rights and media organizations, and others, like Wikimedia\u2014believe that this runs contrary to the basic principles of international law: no one country should be able to impose its rules on the citizens of another country, especially when it comes to linking to lawful content. Adopting such a rule would encourage other countries, including less democratic regimes, to try to impose their values on citizens in the rest of the world.We\u2019re speaking out because restricting access to lawful and valuable information is contrary to our mission as a company and keeps us from delivering the comprehensive search service that people expect of us. But the threat is much greater than this. These cases represent a serious assault on the public\u2019s right to access lawful information. We will argue in court for a reasonable interpretation of the right to be forgotten and for the ability of countries around the world to set their own laws, not have those of others imposed on them. Up to November 20, European countries and institutions have the chance to make their views known to the Court. And we encourage everyone who cares about public access to information to stand up and fight to preserve it.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Our grandchildren will have jobs that don\u2019t yet exist, and will live lives we cannot imagine. In Europe, getting the future of work right for individuals, societies and industries means having an open debate about the possibilities right now. We want to be a part of that discussion, and help contribute to a future of work that works for everyone. So last week in Stockholm and The Hague we brought together a range of leading international experts from academia, trade unions, public sector and businesses to discuss the impact of technology on jobs. We also worked with McKinsey on a report on the impact of automation on work, jobs and skills. As advances in machine learning and robotics make headlines, there\u2019s a heated debate about whether innovation is a magic fix for an aging workforce, or a fast track to mass unemployment. Data can illuminate that debate, and McKinsey focused their research on the Nordics, Benelux, Ireland and Estonia\u2014a diverse group which have at least one thing in common: They\u2019re Europe\u2019s digital frontrunners. The report from McKinsey shows us that while automation will impact existing jobs, innovation and adopting new technology can increase the total number of jobs available.The report makes it very clear that divergent paths are possible. To make a success of the digital transition, countries should promote adoption of new technologies and double down on skills training and education. We want to play our part here. One example of how we contribute is our program Digitalakademin in Sweden: So far, we\u2019ve trained more than 20,000 people in small- and medium-sized business in digital skills. And together with the Swedish National Employment Agency we\u2019ve developed training to help unemployed people get the skills necessary for the jobs of the future.As Erik Sandstr\u00f6m from the National Employment Agency stressed at our event in Stockholm, it \u201call starts with digital competence\u2014if you\u2019re lacking in digital competence you will overestimate the risks and underestimate the opportunities.\u201d That sentiment was echoed in a keynote by Ylva Johansson, the Swedish Minister for Employment and Integration: \u201cWhy do we have an attitude where unions, employees are positively accepting ongoing changes? Because we\u2019ve been able to protect people and to present new opportunities through reskilling.\u201d\nFor our event in The Hague we partnered with Dutch company Randstad to discuss the same topic of future of work. Their CEO, Jacques van den Broek, struck an optimistic tone: \u201cThe digital transformation is an opportunity, not a threat,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lesson we\u2019ve learned is that whilst some jobs disappear, tech creates jobs. The longer you wait to embrace that change, the longer it takes to be able to compete.\u201d The coming changes will likely affect a wide range of tasks and jobs. \u201cIn Denmark, we discussed the destruction of jobs,\u201d Thomas S\u00f8by from the Danish Steelworkers Union said. \u201cNew ones are created,\u201d he added. \u201cBut some people will lose their jobs and feel left behind, and as a society we need to take care of those people.\u201dThose new jobs aren\u2019t simply replacements\u2014they\u2019re roles we don\u2019t have yet. \u201cIn a few years something else will be hot,\u201d said Aart-Jan de Geus of Bertelsmann Stiftung, a German private foundation which looks at managing future challenges. He stressed that fears about job losses shouldn\u2019t be overstated, especially as consumer demand and spending won\u2019t go away. \u201cThe big mistake would be to try to protect jobs; we need to protect workers.\u201dIn The Hague, Eric Schmidt, Alphabet\u2019s executive chairman, ended on a positive note, saying that anxiety about change was understandable but that society can make sure the digital transition includes everyone. \u201cIncumbents resist change. This is not new and in fact we have seen it throughout every stage of history,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if history has taught us anything, it is that when disruptors and pioneers are right, society always recalibrates.\u201d\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

This includes government requests for user data in criminal cases, as well as national security matters under U.S. law. Google fought for the right to publish this information in court and before Congress, and we continue to believe that this type of transparency can inform the broader debate about the nature and scope of government surveillance laws and programs. In the first half of 2017, worldwide, we received 48,941 government requests that relate to 83,345 accounts. You can see more detailed figures, including a country-by-country breakdown of requests, here. We\u2019ve also posted updated figures for the number of users/accounts impacted by Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requests for content in previous reporting periods. While the total number of FISA content requests was reported accurately, we inadvertently under-reported the user/account figures in some reporting periods and over-reported the user/account figures in the second half of 2010. The corrected figures are in the latest report and reflected on our visible changes page.Updating Electronic Privacy LawsWe are publishing the latest update to our Transparency Report as the U.S. Congress embarks upon an important debate concerning the nature and scope of key FISA provisions. Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 expires at the end of 2017. This is the section of FISA that authorizes the U.S. government to compel service providers like Google to disclose user data (including communications content) about non-U.S. persons in order to acquire \u201cforeign intelligence information.\u201d Earlier this year, we expressed support for specific reforms to Section 702. We continue to believe that Congress can enact reforms to Section 702 in a way that enhances privacy protection for internet users while protecting national security. Independent bodies have concluded that Section 702 is valuable and effective in protecting national security and producing useful foreign intelligence. These assessments, however, do not preclude reforms that improve privacy protections for U.S. and non-U.S. persons and that do not disturb the core purposes of Section 702.Government access laws are due for a fundamental realignment and update in light of the proliferation of technology, the very real security threats to people, and the expectations of privacy that Internet users have in their communications. Our General Counsel, Kent Walker, delivered a speech earlier this year calling for a new framework to address cross-border law enforcement requests. Updates to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) will be necessary to create a legal framework that addresses both law enforcement and civil liberties concerns.The recent introduction of the International Communications Privacy Act (ICPA) in the Senate and the House is a significant step in the right direction, and we applaud Senators Hatch, Coons, and Heller and Representatives Collins, Jeffries, Issa, and DeBene for their leadership on this important bill. ECPA should also be updated to enable countries that commit to baseline privacy, due process, and human rights principles to make direct requests to U.S. providers. Providing a pathway for such countries to obtain electronic evidence directly from service providers in other jurisdictions will remove incentives for the unilateral, extraterritorial assertion of a country\u2019s laws, data localization proposals, aggressive expansion of government access authorities, and dangerous investigative techniques. These measures ultimately weaken privacy, due process, and human rights standards.We look forward to continuing in the constructive discussion about these issues.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Updated October 3, 2017\u00a0to include additional excerpts from the speech.The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism is a group of four technology companies\u2014Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube\u2014that are committed to working together and with governments and civil society to address the problem of online terrorist content.For our companies, terrorism isn\u2019t just a business concern or a technical challenge. These are deeply personal threats. We are citizens of London, Paris, Jakarta, and New York. And in the wake of each terrorist attack we too frantically check in on our families and co-workers to make sure they are safe. We\u2019ve all had to do this far too often. The products that our companies build lower barriers to innovation and empower billions of people around the world. But we recognize that the internet and other tools have also been abused by terrorists in their efforts to recruit, fundraise, and organize. And we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that our platforms aren't used to distribute terrorist material.The Forum\u2019s efforts are focused on three areas: leveraging technology, conducting research on patterns of radicalization and misuse of online platforms, and sharing best practices to accelerate our joint efforts against dangerous radicalization. Let me say more about each pillar.First, when it comes to technology, you should know that our companies are putting our best talent and technology against the task of getting terrorist content off our services. There is no silver bullet when it comes to finding and removing this content, but we\u2019re getting much better.One early success in collaboration has been our \u201chash sharing\u201d database, which allows a company that discovers terrorist content on one of their sites to create a digital fingerprint and share it with the other companies in the coalition, who can then more easily detect and review similar content for removal. \u00a0We have to deal with these problems at tremendous scale. The haystacks are unimaginably large and the needles are both very small and constantly changing. People upload over 400 hours of content to YouTube every minute. Our software engineers have spent years developing technology that can spot certain telltale cues and markers. In recent months we have more than doubled the number of videos we've removed for violent extremism and have located these videos twice as fast. And what\u2019s more, 75 percent of the violent extremism videos we\u2019ve removed in recent months were found using technology before they received a single human flag.These efforts are working. Between August 2015 and June 2017, Twitter suspended more than 935,000 accounts for the promotion of terrorism. During the first half of 2017, over 95 percent of the accounts it removed were detected using its in-house technology. Facebook is using new advances in artificial intelligence to root out \"terrorist clusters\" by mapping out the pages, posts, and profiles with terrorist material and then shutting them down.Despite this recent progress, machines are simply not at the stage where they can replace human judgment. For example, portions of a terrorist video in a news broadcast might be entirely legitimate, but a computer program will have difficulty distinguishing documentary coverage from incitement. \u00a0We continue to speed up removals and are committed to working together to find new ways to quickly get this content off our platforms. We are making significant progress, but removing all of this content within a few hours\u2014or indeed stopping it from appearing on the internet in the first place\u2014poses an enormous technological and scientific challenge.The Forum\u2019s second pillar is focused on conducting and sharing research about how terrorists use the internet to influence their audiences so that we can stay one step ahead.Today, the members of the Forum are pleased to announce that we are making a multi-million dollar commitment to support research on terrorist abuse of the internet and how governments, tech companies, and civil society can fight back against online radicalization.The Forum has also set a goal of working with 50 smaller tech companies to help them better tackle terrorist content on their platforms. On Monday, we hosted dozens of companies for a workshop with our partners under the UN Counter Terrorism Executive Directorate. There will be a workshop in Brussels in December and another in Indonesia in the coming months. And we are also working to expand the hash-sharing database to smaller companies.The Forum\u2019s final pillar is working together to find powerful messages and avenues to reach out to those at greatest risk of radicalization.Members of the forum are doing a better job of sharing breakthroughs with each other. One success we\u2019ve seen is with the Redirect Method developed at Alphabet\u2019s Jigsaw group. Redirect uses targeted advertising to reach people searching for terrorist content and presents videos that undermine extremist recruiting efforts. During a recent eight-week study more than 300,000 users clicked on our targeted ads and watched more than 500,000 minutes of video. This past April, Microsoft started a similar program on Bing. And Jigsaw and Bing are now exploring a partnership to share best practices and expertise.At the same time, we\u2019re elevating the voices that are most credible in speaking out against terrorism, hate, and violence. YouTube\u2019s Creators for Change program highlights online stars taking a stand against xenophobia and extremism. \u00a0And Facebook's P2P program has brought together more than 5,000 students from 68 countries to create campaigns to combat hate speech. And together the companies have participated in hundreds of meetings and trainings to counter violent extremism including events in Beirut, Bosnia, and Brussels and summits at the White House, here at the United Nations, London, and Sydney to empower credible non-governmental voices against violent extremism.There is no magic computer program that will eliminate online terrorist content, but we are committed to working with everyone in this room as we continue to ramp up our own efforts to stop terrorists\u2019 abuse of our services. This forum is an important step in the right direction. We look forward to working with national and local governments, and civil society, to prevent extremist ideology from spreading in communities and online.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

I know, because I\u2019ve worked on this from the day I joined in 2012. We have hired and funded advocates in this area. We have developed and built extensive technology to connect victims with the resources they need. And we have helped pioneer the use of technologies that identify trafficking networks to make it easier and quicker for law enforcement to arrest these abusers. You can read about these efforts here.\u00a0We\u2019ve supported over 40 bills on human trafficking. And we are determined to do more to stop this evil, including support for tougher legislation.\u00a0There is currently a debate over a proposed bill to combat sex trafficking by amending section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. While we agree with the intentions of the bill, we are concerned that it erodes the \u201cgood samaritan\u201d protection and would actually hinder the fight against sex trafficking. While large companies are more likely to continue their proactive enforcement efforts and can afford to fight lawsuits, if smaller platforms are made liable for \u201cknowledge\u201d of human trafficking occurring on their platforms, there is a risk that some will seek to avoid that \u201cknowledge\u201d; they will simply stop looking for it. This would be a disaster. We think it\u2019s much better to foster an environment in which all technology companies can continue to clean their platforms and support effective tools for law enforcement and advocacy organizations to find and disrupt these networks. We\u2019ve met with the sponsors of the particular bill and provided alternatives that will encourage this environment, and we\u2019ll continue to seek a constructive approach to advance a shared goal.We\u2019re not alone in this view. Organizations as broad and diverse as Engine Advocacy, PEN America, Charles Koch Institute, Heritage Action, ACLU, U.S. Chamber Technology Engagement Center, Business Software Alliance, Internet Commerce Coalition, Internet Association (whose members include Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Snap, Match.com, Pinterest, etc.), TechFreedom, Medium, GitHub, Reddit, Wikimedia, National Venture Capital Association and many others have raised concerns about the bill. We\u2014and many others\u2014stand ready to work with Congress on changes to the bill, and on other legislation and measures to fight human trafficking and protect and support victims and survivors.A lot of the discussion around this issue focuses on the role of a website called Backpage.com. I want to make our position on this clear. Google believes that Backpage.com can and should be held accountable for its crimes. We strongly applaud the work of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in exposing Backpage's intentional promotion of child sex trafficking through ads. Based on those findings, Google believes that Backpage.com should be criminally prosecuted by the US Department of Justice for facilitating child sex trafficking, something they can do today without need to amend any laws. And years before the Senate's investigation and report, we prohibited Backpage from advertising on Google, and we have criticized Backpage publicly.I understand that when important legislation is being discussed, public debate is robust. That\u2019s how it should be. But on the crucial issue of sex trafficking, we\u2019ve been a deeply committed partner in the fight. Let\u2019s not let a genuine disagreement over the likely unintended impact of a particular piece of legislation obscure that fact.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It was the first report of its kind and a natural extension of our mission to make information accessible and useful. In the years since, our simple tool evolved into the Transparency Report, a multifaceted snapshot of the ways governments and corporations affect online security, privacy, and the free flow of information.The web has evolved too, and has become central to people\u2019s lives: 400 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, more than one billion people rely on Gmail and Chrome, every day. And this type reporting, once an anomaly, has become the norm across the tech industry and beyond. More than 40 companies now have transparency reports; that\u2019s great news for people everywhere.But while the report itself expanded in scope and coverage, its design remained largely unchanged. Not only was it due for a little update, we heard from users it could be easier to navigate as well.So today we\u2019re introducing the completely revamped Transparency Report. It features clearer data visualizations, more context for the data, a Recent Updates section so you can see what\u2019s new, and a better way to download data from our most popular reports. And while the previous version was a patchwork of different reports, designed at different times in different styles, our new report is all one consistent design, making it easier to find exactly what you\u2019re looking for.\nWe\u2019re continuing to invest in this report because we\u2019ve seen firsthand how it can help inform and shape the public debate about information online. The data also acts as a lens into significant moments in the history of the web, fundamental changes to security, and our efforts to be transparent about data and how it is used. Here are a few examples:Our Traffic and Disruptions report documents real-time disruptions to usage of our products. Here\u2019s what the report looked like for search in Egypt in January of 2011 when internet access was restricted during the Arab Spring.\nAs we say in the report, \u201cwhen you send or receive emails from a provider that doesn\u2019t encrypt messages in transit, they are as open to snoopers as a postcard in the mail.\u201d In 2014, we started reporting on the state of email encryption across the industry and which providers offer this protection. It\u2019s been really encouraging to see how these trends have changed. Since then, outbound email encryption has gone from 73 percent to 88 percent., and inbound email encryption has gone from 61 percent to 88 percent since the launch of the report as well. We hope these numbers continue to increase in the years ahead.\nAnd going back to the report\u2019s original mission\u2014government requests\u2014we\u2019re constantly pushing for more complete and accurate data. The results of this effort are visible directly in the report. In December 2016, for example, after a years-long effort, we were able to share National Security Letters with the public, for the first time.Over the years, the Transparency Report has sparked new conversations about transparency, accountability and the role of governments and companies in the flow of information online. Our hope is that with these changes, we can start a few more.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

For example, the report attributes to Google any work that was supported by any organization to which we belong or have ever donated (such as CCIA).Nevertheless, we\u2019re proud to maintain strong relations with academics, universities and research institutes, in our own name, so we wanted to take a few moments to respond to the report.We run many research programs that provide funding and resources to the external research community. This helps public and private institutions pursue research on important topics in computer science, technology, and a wide range of public policy and legal issues. Our support for the principles underlying an open internet is shared by many academics and institutions who have a long history of undertaking research on these topics\u2014across important areas like copyright, patents, and free expression. We provide support to help them undertake further research, and to raise awareness of their ideas.These programs (and those run by other companies) augment the government and university-funded research that is the backbone of academic discourse in the United States.We also run policy fellowship programs. Most other companies do this too; the difference with Google is that we list ours publicly on our policy website.Our funding is guided by these principles:Disclosure requirements: When we provide financial support, we expect and require grantees to properly disclose our funding. If there are ever omissions or unclear disclosures, we work to tighten our requirements.Independence: We value academic independence and integrity. We offer grants for discrete pieces of research, not to shape academics\u2019 subsequent scholarship. The researchers and institutions to whom we award research grants will often publish research with which we disagree. In fact, many of the academics listed by the Campaign for Accountability have criticized Google and our policy positions heavily on a variety of topics. Here are just three of the academics on their list, opposing and arguing against us on antitrust, net neutrality and privacy.The irony of discussing disclosures and transparency with the \u201cCampaign for Accountability\u201d is that this group consistently refuses to name its corporate funders. \u00a0And those backers won\u2019t \u2018fess up either. \u00a0The one funder the world does know about is Oracle, which is running a well-documented lobbying campaign against us. In its own name and through proxies, Oracle has funded many hundreds of articles, research papers, symposia and reports. Oracle is not alone\u2014you can easily find similar activity by companies and organizations funded by our competitors, like AT&T, the MPAA, ICOMP, FairSearch and dozens more; including hundreds of pieces directly targeting Google. We\u2019re proud of our programs and their integrity. The \u201cCampaign for Accountability\u201d and its funders are, clearly, not proud of theirs.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

And advertisers want to promote those same products. That's why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both.We believe the European Commission\u2019s online shopping decision underestimates the value of those\u00a0kinds of fast and easy connections. While some comparison shopping sites naturally want Google to show them more prominently, our data shows that people usually prefer links that take them directly to the products they want, not to websites where they have to repeat their searches.We think our current shopping results are useful and are a much-improved version of the text-only ads we showed a decade ago. Showing ads that include pictures, ratings, and prices benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, our users. And we show them only when your feedback tells us they are relevant. Thousands of European merchants use these ads to compete with larger companies like Amazon and eBay.\nWhen the Commission asks why some comparison websites have not done as well as others, we think it should consider the many sites that have grown in this period--including platforms like Amazon and eBay. With its comparison tools, reviews, millions of retailers, and vast range of products from sneakers to groceries, Amazon is a formidable competitor and has become the first port of call for product searches. \u00a0And as Amazon has grown, it\u2019s natural that some comparison services have proven less popular than others. We compete with Amazon and other sites for shopping-related searches by showing ever more useful product information.When you use Google to search for products, we try to give you what you\u2019re looking for. Our ability to do that well isn\u2019t favoring ourselves, or any particular site or seller--it\u2019s the result of hard work and constant innovation, based on user feedback.Given the evidence, we respectfully disagree with the conclusions announced today.

And for each new advance in communications, law enforcement has adapted. With the advent of the post office, police got warrants to search letters and packages. With the arrival of telephones, police served subpoenas for the call logs of suspects. Digital communications have now gone well beyond the Postal Service and Ma Bell. But the laws that govern evidence-gathering on the internet were written before the Information Revolution, and are now both hindering the flow of information to law enforcement and jeopardizing user privacy as a result.These rules are due for a fundamental realignment in light of the rapid growth of technology that relies on the cloud, the very real security threats that face people and communities, and the expectations of privacy that internet users have in their communications.Today, we\u2019re proposing a new framework that allows countries that commit to baseline privacy, human rights, and due process principles to gather evidence more quickly and efficiently. We believe these reforms would not only help law enforcement conduct more effective investigations but also encourage countries to improve and align on privacy and due process standards. Further, reducing the amount of time countries have to wait to gather evidence means would reduce the pressure to pursue more problematic ways of trying to gather data.Current laws hinder law enforcement and user privacyThe U.S. Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) governs requests for content from law enforcement. Under ECPA, foreign countries largely have to rely on diplomatic mechanisms such as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLAT) to obtain content that is held by a company in the United States. The last data we\u2019ve seen suggests that the average wait to receive content through the MLAT process is 10 months, far too long for most criminal cases. While law enforcement waits for this data, crimes could remain unsolved or a trial might happen missing key evidence.The current legal framework poses a threat to users\u2019 privacy as well. Faced with the extended delays under the MLAT process, some countries are now asserting that their laws apply to companies and individuals outside of their borders. Countries asserting extraterritorial authority potentially put companies in an untenable situation where we risk violating either the law of the requesting country or the law of the country where we are headquartered.We are also seeing various proposals to require companies to store data within local borders as a means to gain easier access. There are a host of problems with this: small, one-off data centers are easier targets for attackers and jeopardize data security and privacy. Further, requiring businesses to build these data-centers will raise the costs for cloud services, erecting significant barriers for smaller companies.The legal ambiguity concerning cross-border law enforcement requests has also created complications for law enforcement in the United States. Last year, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals was asked to determine the reach of ECPA search warrants issued under the now out-of-date statute. The Court ruled that under existing law, an ECPA search warrant cannot be used to compel service providers to disclose user data that is stored outside of the U.S. But even those judges agreed that ECPA should be updated by Congress to reflect the new reality of today\u2019s global networks.Principles for reformOur proposal to address these challenges for domestic and international law enforcement, for companies, and for users has two core principles:First, countries that honor baseline principles of privacy, human rights, and due process should be able to make direct requests to service providers for user data that pertains to serious crimes that happen within their borders and users who are within their jurisdiction. \u00a0While the U.S. cannot solve the problem on its own, and many countries have blocking regulations, policy reform in the US is a necessary first step. We\u2019ve been pleased to see serious debate around ways to update digital evidence laws in Washington on this issue.In May, the U.S. Department of Justice presented legislation that would amend ECPA and \u00a0authorize U.S. providers to disclose records and communications content to foreign governments that adhere to baseline due process, human rights, and privacy standards. This legislation would be the critical starting point for the new framework of direct requests.ECPA should also be updated to address what data is available using an ECPA search warrant in a way that serves broader public policy objectives. Law enforcement requests for digital evidence should be based on the location and nationality of users, not the location of data. A key component of this reform is the International Communications Privacy Act (ICPA), which Google supports. ICPA provides a unique opportunity for Congress to update laws governing digital evidence both for investigations in the U.S. and abroad. While refinements to ICPA may be necessary, we believe the principles upon which ICPA is based are sound.Second, provided that countries can meet baseline standards and the U.S. amends ECPA, the next step would be for the United States and foreign governments to sign new agreements that could provide an alternative to the MLAT process. The bilateral agreements that could be authorized by the legislation put forward by the Department of Justice provide a promising avenue to improve global privacy standards and create a pathway for foreign governments to obtain digital evidence for investigations.We\u2019re ready to do our partWe know that this will be an involved process. It\u2019ll require action here in Washington and in capitals around the world. However, we can\u2019t accept the complexity of action as a reason for inaction in addressing an important and growing problem.Our proposal asks for a lot of movement from governments. But we recognize our role as well. Google is ready to work with legislators, regulators, civil society, academics, and other companies to progress these proposals and make sure that we get this right. And I look forward to conversations that we\u2019ll have in Washington, D.C. and beyond in the months to come.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

In the second half of 2016, we received over 45,000 government requests for user data worldwide. This is the most government requests we\u2019ve received for user data in a six-month period since we released our first transparency report in 2010.In many ways, this shouldn\u2019t be surprising. As more people use more of our services, and as we offer new ones, it is natural that we are seeing an increase in government requests. For example, Gmail had around 425 million active users in 2012, and more than 1 billion by 2016. And as digital evidence increasingly becomes part of criminal investigations, other companies are seeing similar trends. We of course continue to require appropriate legal process for these requests, resist overbroad requests not narrowly calibrated to legitimate law enforcement requirements, and reform modernization of data surveillance laws. \u00a0Cross-border requests for data continue to account for a substantial portion of overall requests, with over 31,000 in the second half of 2016 coming from outside of the United States.. This volume underscores the need for an improved international framework that meets legitimate law enforcement needs and ensures high standards of due process, privacy and human rights. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) process facilitates the production of digital evidence in cross-border investigations (when the crime occurs in one country but data is held by a company in another country). But the MLAT process is often slow and cumbersome: on average, it takes 10 months to process an MLAT request in the United States. That\u2019s a long time for an investigator to wait.Without better and faster ways to collect cross-border evidence, countries will be tempted to take unilateral actions to deal with a fundamentally multilateral problem. A sustainable framework for handling digital evidence in legitimate cross-border investigations will help avoid a chaotic, conflicting patchwork of data location proposals and ad hoc surveillance measures that may threaten privacy and generate uncertainty, without fundamentally advancing legitimate law enforcement and national security interests.We believe that governments can develop solutions that appropriately balance the various interests at stake. This includes respecting the legitimate privacy rights of users, wherever they are, as well as the obligations of governments to investigate crimes and protect their residents. The conversation should include a broad group of stakeholders, including not just law enforcement and national security perspectives, but also the voices of citizens, civil society groups and providers of information services that cross national borders.This discussion will raise difficult questions about the scope of government surveillance powers, the extent of digital jurisdiction, the importance of rapid investigations, and privacy rights in the Internet age\u2014fundamental issues that can\u2019t be adequately addressed by courts using antiquated legal standards or by governments acting in an ad hoc fashion.We look forward to sharing more thoughts about the legal frameworks that can address some of these challenges in the coming weeks and months. And we look forward to working with relevant stakeholders to craft viable and lasting solutions. \u00a0\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

This community-driven clearinghouse, developed together with our Android partners, ensures that innovation and consumer choice\u2014not patent threats\u2014will continue to be key drivers of our Android ecosystem. PAX is free to join and open to anyone.Already, Android is distributed under open-source licenses that allow anyone to use it for free. This openness has resulted in enormous choice for manufacturers and users. The Android ecosystem has grown to include more than 400 partner manufacturers and 500 carriers who have produced more than 4,000 major devices in the last year alone with an astounding 1.6 billion active users. We believe PAX will further expand the openness of Android for its members, promoting patent peace that will free up time and money for members, who can then dedicate those resources to creating new ideas.PAX members currently include Google, Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics, Foxconn Technology Group, HMD Global, HTC, Coolpad, BQ, and Allview. The members collectively own more than 230,000 patents worldwide. As more companies join, PAX will bring even more patent peace and value to its members through more freedom to innovate. \u00a0PAX is the latest innovative licensing effort that Google has helped develop in order to provide balanced patent solutions. Other efforts include the LOT Network and the Open Patent Non-assertion Pledge, as well as our participation in such initiatives as the Open Invention Network and IP3 run by Allied Security Trust.

Our goal in doing so is to shed more light on the nature and scope of these requests. We\u2019ve also supported policy efforts to ensure that the privacy interests of non-U.S. persons are addressed as U.S. policymakers consider government surveillance issues.Earlier this month, we highlighted our efforts to comply with the right to be forgotten in Europe. For much of the last year, we\u2019ve worked to defend the idea that each country should be able to balance freedom of expression and privacy in the way that country sees fit, and not according to another country\u2019s interpretation. One Data Protection Authority, the French Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s (the CNIL), ordered Google to delist French right to be forgotten removals for users everywhere. We agree with the CNIL that privacy is a fundamental right \u2014 but so, too, is the right to free expression. Any balance struck between those two rights must be accompanied by territorial limits, consistent with the basic principles of international law.These are some examples of Google\u2019s public policy work that illustrate our commitment to the freedom of expression and privacy rights of our users. We know that pressing global issues are best addressed in partnership with with key stakeholders \u2014 and the GNI is critical to Google\u2019s efforts.The GNI is at the core of our multi-stakeholder engagement on free expression and privacy issues. Google is proud to be a founding member of the GNI, an initiative that brings together ICT companies with civil society organizations, investors, and academics to define a shared approach to freedom of expression and privacy online. The GNI provides a framework for company operations, rooted in international standards; promotes accountability of ICT sector companies through independent assessment; enables multi-stakeholder policy engagement; and creates shared learning opportunities across stakeholder boundaries.Earlier this year, GNI released the second round of assessments, and announced the board\u2019s determination that Google is compliant with the GNI framework. The assessment is an important tool for companies, NGOs, academics, and others working together to review how companies address risks to privacy and free expression.The assessment process includes a review of relevant internal systems, policies and procedures for implementing the GNI Principles (\u201cthe process review\u201d), and an examination of specific cases or examples that show how the company is implementing them in practice (the \u201ccase review\u201d).Our cases were selected for their salience to our approach to implementing the GNI Principles, taking into consideration Google\u2019s products and services, geographical footprint, operating environments, and human rights risk profile. In addition, to the Google-specific cases discussed in GNI\u2019s public assessment report, we wanted to provide additional examples to illustrate the types of non-U.S. cases reviewed.Request for user dataA request was made for Gmail user information by a federal police department. A key part of our process is making sure that the requests we receive are appropriately supported by legal process. In this case, we found that the initial request was inadequate due to failure to have a judicial stamp or signature, and we therefore pushed back, as we would not comply unless the request was judicially authorized. Once these items were obtained and, we determined that it was a valid legal request (including that it was not overbroad), we complied with the request.Request for removalA request for Blogger content removal was made by a regulatory agency. The requestor claimed that content was subject to removal under the country\u2019s statute prohibiting appeals to mass riots, extremist activities, and mass actions against established order. In reviewing the request, we determined that the content did not violate our terms of service. \u00a0We then responded by requesting a copy of the decision citing specific URLs that are illegal. This would be evidence of an authoritative interpretation of the local law as applied to the content. \u00a0As there was no response from the requestor, and the content did not violate our company policies, the request was denied and we did not remove the material.RTBF: Push for Judicial Review; Careful Development and Implementation of Rigorous Removal Process for RequestsThis example describes how we responded to requests subsequent to the Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja ruling, which presented risks to freedom of expression. In the Costeja case, we appealed through the court process, but were unsuccessful. \u00a0We pushed back on this ruling because we considered the requirement for Google to take down this information to be in conflict with freedom of expression. On appeal, the Court of Justice of the European Union found that people have the right to ask for information to be removed from search results that include their names if it is \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.\u201d In deciding what to remove, search engines must also have regard to the public interest, without additional guidance regarding what information constitutes \u201cpublic interest.\u201d The court also decided that search engines don\u2019t qualify for a \u201cjournalistic exception.\u201d We continue to fight court cases seeking to expand this requirement for takedowns globally.We also convened the Advisory Council to Google on the Right to be Forgotten to review input from dozens of experts in meetings across Europe, as well as from thousands of submissions via the Web. The Council included Frank La Rue, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of the Right to Freedom of Opinion and Expression. The Council advised us on performing the balancing act between an individual\u2019s right to privacy and the public\u2019s interest in access to information.In response to the Costeja ruling, Google established a dedicated team to develop and implement a system to remove valid RtbF requests. We evaluate each request appropriately, complying with the law, but making sure that, if there is a legal basis for the content to remain available, we will assess how that applies. To address the ruling, we assembled a team to address the new category of requests arising from the rights articulated in Costeja. Our web removals site was updated to include information about and a portal for RtbF requests. Requests are reviewed by the legal removals team; after review, the requester is notified of the determination. Since implementing this system, we have delisted approximately 780,000 URLs. Our process responds to individual requests and carefully evaluates \u00a0each request against the criteria for removal. We also notify websites when one of their pages has been removed pursuant to a RtbF claim. In addition to removing URLs, we include information about RtbF requests and removals in our Transparency Report.Our assessors also provided us with recommendations for enhancing our implementation of the GNI Principles. These recommendations, combined with feedback and ongoing engagement with GNI stakeholders, will inform our policies and practices and strengthen our advocacy in 2017.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

We previewed this back in October when we updated our Transparency Report.As we have described in the past, we have fought for the right to be transparent about our receipt of NSLs. This includes working with the government to publish statistics about NSLs we\u2019ve received, successfully fighting NSL gag provisions in court, and leading the effort to ensure that Internet companies can be more transparent with users about the volume and scope of national security demands that we receive. \u00a0\u00a0In 2015, Congress passed the USA Freedom Act, which allowed companies like Google to make more granular disclosures \u00a0about National Security Letters they receive. \u00a0In addition, the Act restricts the use of indefinite gag restrictions that prevent providers from ever notifying customers or talking about the demands. The Department of Justice (DOJ) must now regularly review disclosure restrictions in NSLs and lift those that are no longer needed. The United States Attorney General approved procedures to do this, and as we mentioned recently, the FBI has started lifting gag restrictions on particular NSLs.We are now making copies of those NSLs available. \u00a0Our goal in doing so is to shed more light on the nature and scope of NSLs. We minimized redactions to protect privacy interests, but the content of the NSLs remain as they were when served. \u00a0We are also publishing the correspondence reflecting the lifting of the nondisclosure restrictions.

Since then, dams and thousands of kilometers of levees have been built to control the mighty Mississippi. 60 years on, another effect of the historic flood is becoming apparent. As the river has become calmer, it now also carries a lot less of the sediment that created and replenished the delta. Without that, more than 13 thousand square kilometers of the delta -- an area 10 times the size of London -- is slowly slipping into the Gulf of Mexico. Once again the river is threatening to displace thousands and drown the fragile delta wetlands.\nMississippi delta sinking into the Gulf of Mexico. Blue is water, white is land, red shows areas of transition. (Source: EC JRC / Google)\nThe change of the Mississippi over decades is just one of the hundreds of stories of similarly dramatic change around the globe; from the draining of the Aral Sea in the Middle East for crops, to the effects of dam construction in China, or the impacts of the multi-year drought on the Western U.S. \u00a0Water has been shaping our planet since it was formed, and still plays a direct and crucial role in all of our lives.\nThe Aral Sea, Kazakhstan\nPoyang Lake, Jiangxi China\nLake Mead, Nevada\nThanks to a partnership between the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre and Google, we can now get a view into the past three decades of water on the surface of Earth and see how stories like these have shaped the world over time, in unprecedented detail.\u00a0 \u00a0This project has been a monumental undertaking and was made possible by new data processing methods, running the analysis on thousands of high performance computers at the same time. It took three years to download 1.8 petabytes of data from the USGS/NASA Landsat satellite program and prepare that for analysis. Each pixel in 3 million satellite images, going all the way back to 1984, was examined by a computer algorithm developed by the Joint Research Center running on the\u00a0Google Earth Engine\u00a0platform. More than 10 million hours of computing time was needed for this, roughly equivalent to a modern 2-core computer running day and night for 600 years. \u00a0\nKarkheh River in Iran backing up behind a dam from 1984 to 2015 (Source: EC JRC / Google) \nThe results for the first time allow us to map and measure changes in the water surface over time with a 30-meter accuracy, month-by-month, over 32 years. Here are some of our findings: \u00a090 thousand square kilometers of water - the equivalent of half of the lakes in Europe - have vanished altogether. Over 200 thousand square kilometers of new, mostly man-made water bodies came into existence. The continuing drying up of the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan accounts for the biggest loss in the world. Iran and Afghanistan lost over a half, Iraq over a third of its water area. Although the area covered by water in the U.S. has overall increased a little, a combination of drought and sustained demand for water have seen six western states, Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, account for a third of the loss in U.S. water surface.\u00a0\nLakes throughout the Tibetan Plateau have expanded in size over the past 30 years.

In addition, pursuant to the USA Freedom Act, the FBI lifted a gag restriction on an NSL issued in the second half of 2015. To reflect this, we have updated the range of NSLs received in that period \u2014 July to December 2015 \u2014 from 0-499 to 1-499.As we have noted in the past, when we receive a request for user information, we review it carefully and only provide information within the scope and authority of the request. \u00a0The privacy and security of the data that users store with Google is central to our approach. \u00a0Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law, for example to compel us to disclose content in criminal cases we require the government use a search warrant, and that it complies with Google's strict policies (to prevent overreach that can compromise users\u2019 privacy). \u00a0In the US, in the current reporting period, Google saw an increase in the number of accounts covered by requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) (21,000-21,499), compared to the previous reporting period (16,000-16,499). (Note that the USA Freedom Act authorizes companies like Google to report these figures in ranges, but not precise numbers.)\u00a0In recent years, the United States has implemented or enacted meaningful surveillance reforms. \u00a0And the U.S. Congress is beginning the process of assessing potential reforms to Section 702 of FISA, which authorizes surveillance of non-U.S. persons outside of the United States. \u00a0\u00a0We look forward to working together with others in our industry on continuing surveillance reform in the U.S. and around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

It\u2019s a principle that holds true today and one we support through leading-edge efforts to combat copyright-infringing activity.Today the European Commission announced its proposal to\u00a0update copyright rules\u00a0for the digital age. There\u2019s an important balance to be struck\u2014one that enables rightsholders to manage and profit from their work while also allowing the creativity and innovation of the web to flourish.There are things to like in the proposal. We\u2019re pleased to see the Commission mandating more transparency and data sharing for artists and rightsholders, an important step to building fairer and more effective copyright marketplaces. This should empower European creators to connect more effectively with their audiences and better understand how they are rewarded.We\u2019re reassured that the Commission has recognised that content-management technologies like\u00a0YouTube\u2019s Content ID\u00a0play an important role in tackling the unauthorised use of protected content (although we\u2019d caution against rigid requirements that smaller and start-up companies may find hard to implement).But there are also worrying elements, given that the web depends on users\u2019 ability to share content. Today\u2019s proposal suggests that works including text, video, images and more must be filtered by online services. This would effectively turn the internet into a place where everything uploaded to the web must be cleared by lawyers before it can find an audience.Under the rules of the\u00a0European eCommerce Directive, that\u2019s not how it works. Platforms are not obliged proactively to monitor what users upload\u2014but must act when notified of an infringement. Through Content ID, YouTube blocks or monetizes content that has been claimed by a copyright owner according to their instructions. This is an important distinction, without which many hosting services simply could not exist.We\u2019re also disappointed to see a proposal for a new right for press publishers, despite tens of thousands of voices\u2014including ours\u2014calling for a different approach. The proposal looks similar to failed laws in Germany and Spain, and represents a backward step for copyright in Europe. It would hurt anyone who writes, reads or shares the news\u2014including the many European startups working with the news sector to build sustainable business models online.As proposed, it could also limit Google\u2019s ability to send monetizable traffic, for free, to news publishers via Google News and Search. After all, paying to display snippets is not a viable option for anyone.We believe there\u2019s a better way. Innovation and partnership\u2014not subsidies and onerous restrictions\u2014are the key to a successful, diverse and sustainable news sector in the EU, and Google is committed to playing its part.The\u00a0Digital News Initiative, which now includes more than 160 European publishers, has already delivered game-changing, open-source technology through\u00a0Accelerated Mobile Pages, enabling news publishers to deliver their stories and advertising to mobile phones at lightning speed, while maintaining control of their content and monetisation options. The DNI is also investing 150 million Euros in news innovation projects in Europe.And YouTube\u2019s Content ID, which we\u2019ve spent 9 years and $60 million to develop\u2014including recent advancements in machine learning \u2014currently handles 98% of copyright management on YouTube. Since its launch Content ID has\u00a0paid out over $2 billion\u00a0to rightsholders while encouraging innovation by a new generation of creators eager to promote their work.Today\u2019s proposal is a first step towards a better functioning marketplace for European creators and consumers--but the appropriate balance has not yet been struck. It\u2019s vital to preserve the principles of linking, sharing and creativity on which so much of the web\u2019s success is built, and we\u2019re keen to play our part in the discussion.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

Today, we're announcing the addition of 11 more countries to Google Patents with over 41 million new patent publications, bringing the total to over 87 million publications from 17 patent offices around the world.Starting today, you can now search for patents and applications from Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Belgium, Russia, the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, and Luxembourg in Google Patents. If you\u2019re interested in learning more about inventions such as bulldozing devices, wind farming, or how to make rice wine, you can now search for them and many more.Like our other patent publications, this new collection has been translated into English using Google Translate so you can search using English keywords or the original language. Our collection also includes scientific papers and books from Google Scholarand Google Books, which have been machine-classified like patents with Cooperative Patent Classification codes for easier discovery. You can learn more in the new help center. A robust prior art search, combining advanced search technology and a patent examiner\u2019s technical expertise, allows an examiner to determine if an invention is new and non-obvious. As a result, technology that was already known isn\u2019t taken from the public, and innovative companies won\u2019t be targeted with unnecessary and expensive lawsuits that drain R&D resources. Patent holders trying to protect the next groundbreaking invention benefit too by gaining more certainty that their patents won\u2019t be invalidated later because of prior art that wasn\u2019t found during examination. We\u2019ll continue to improve Google Patents to make the collection of patents and prior art accessible and useful to patent examiners, inventors, and the public around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Google is proud to have led the charge on publishing these reports, helping shed light on government surveillance laws and practices across the world.\nWe\u2019re pleased with some of the improvements we\u2019ve seen in surveillance laws.  The European Commission and the United States recently agreed on the Privacy Shield agreement, which includes new undertakings covering procedural protections for surveillance efforts.  Earlier this year, President Obama signed the Judicial Redress Act into law, which Google strongly supported.  The law creates a process for extending procedural protections under the Privacy Act of 1974 to non-U.S. persons.  This shift helps address concerns about the ability of non-U.S. persons to redress grievances concerning data collected and stored by the U.S. government under U.S. law.  Indeed, the distinctions that U.S. privacy and surveillance laws make between U.S. and non-U.S. persons are increasingly obsolete in a world where communications primarily take place over a global medium: the Internet.\nThere are other important steps that the U.S. can take to ensure that the privacy interests of non-U.S. persons are addressed as policymakers consider government surveillance issues.  We helped create the Reform Government Surveillance coalition to encourage Congress and the executive branch to take steps to modernize U.S. surveillance laws, further protect the privacy and data security rights of all users, including those outside the US and those not of US nationality, and improve diplomatic processes to promote a robust, principled, and transparent framework for legitimate cross-border investigations.\nGoogle looks forward to working on the future rules and standards in countries around the world that, like the Judicial Redress Act, respect the rights of users wherever they may be.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

At Google, we are committed to helping these industries flourish online. Today, Google\u2019s services provide content for people all around the world and generate significant revenue for rightsholders. YouTube alone has now generated over $2 billion to rightsholders by monetizing user-uploaded content through Content ID, its industry-leading rights management system.\nWe take protecting creativity online seriously, and we\u2019re doing more to help battle copyright-infringing activity than ever before. Today, we are releasing an update to our \"How Google Fights Piracy\" report, which explains the robust programs, policies, and technologies we have put in place to combat piracy online.\nHere are a few highlights from those ongoing efforts:\nLeading the industry in finding copyright solutions that work: We go above and beyond the requirements of the law to lead the industry in finding solutions that work. Content ID is a great example of this. Content ID goes beyond a simple \"notice-and-takedown\" system to provide a set of automated tools that empowers rightsholders to automatically claim their content and choose whether to track, block or monetize it on YouTube. Content ID is a highly effective solution, and today over 98% of copyright management on YouTube takes place through Content ID, with only 2% being handled through copyright removal notices.\u00a0\nProviding new revenue streams for media industries and content owners: Content ID has also created a robust new revenue stream for the content industry. YouTube has paid out over $2 billion to rightsholders who have monetized their content through Content ID since it first launched. In fact, today well over 90% of all Content ID claims across the platform result in monetization.  The music industry chooses to monetize more than 95% of their claims, opting to leave the content up on the platform - half of the music industry's YouTube revenue comes from fan content claimed via Content ID. Thanks to Content ID, YouTube is also the only platform that gives partners an automated way to directly monetize background/incidental use and covers.\u00a0\nConnecting fans to better legitimate alternatives: The best way to battle piracy is with better, more convenient, legitimate alternatives. And Google is all-in when it comes to partnering with the content industry to build and enable those alternatives. Through YouTube and Google Play, Google is in the business of helping users legitimately discover, purchase, and enjoy music, movies, books, magazines, and apps. Thanks to these platforms, Google Play has paid out more than $7 billion to developers, while YouTube has paid out more than $3 billion to the music industry. Today, Google Play also makes music available in 62 countries, movies in 105 countries, and books in 75 countries.\u00a0\nSolving for Search: Thanks to the efforts of Google\u2019s engineers, the vast majority of media-related queries that users submit every day return results that include only links to legitimate sites. For any problematic links that may appear for rarer \u201clong-tail\u201d queries, our systems for processing copyright removal notices handle millions of URLs each day, in less than 6 hours on average. And when we get a large number of valid notices for a site, our search ranking algorithms demote that site in future search results.\u00a0\nFollowing the money: Rogue sites that specialize in online piracy are commercial ventures, which means that one effective way to combat them is to cut off their money supply. As a global leader in online advertising, Google is committed to rooting out and ejecting rogue sites from our advertising services. Since 2012, Google has blacklisted more than 91,000 sites from AdSense for violating our policies against copyright infringement, the vast majority caught by AdSense\u2019s own proactive screens. We have also been working with other advertising leaders to craft best practices aimed at raising standards across the entire online advertising industry, including in the U.S., U.K., France, Italy, and Asia.\u00a0\nProtecting and fostering creativity online is a priority for Google. We remain committed to investing in efforts to address copyright infringement online, collaborating with rightsholders and protecting the interests of our users. \nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

We are committed to applying the protections of the Privacy Shield to personal data transferred between Europe and the United States. In the blog we posted on July 12 (below), we detail why the Privacy Shield is an important achievement. We welcome the legal certainty that it brings.Ever since the European Court of Justice invalidated the EU-US Safe Harbor Agreement in October 2015, businesses on both sides of the Atlantic have faced confusion about the future of transatlantic data transfers -- often transfers that are vital to the routine functioning of their operations.  And much ink has been spilled about the complexity of the negotiations required to break the impasse and the resulting tensions in transatlantic relations.\nToday, as the final step in a long process of approvals, the European Commission adopted the new EU-US Privacy Shield.  We applaud this achievement, which demonstrates that the EU and the US share important values and are able to work together to protect the fundamental right to privacy.  \nFollowing the agreement, we will ensure that our products and services meet the new standards of the Privacy Shield. And, building on our work with Europe\u2019s Data Protection Authorities over the last few years, we\u2019re also choosing to co-operate with Europe\u2019s Data Protection Authorities on EU-US Privacy Shield inquiries. \nAs a company operating on both sides of the Atlantic, we welcome the legal certainty the Privacy Shield brings.

Today, in celebration of Father\u2019s Day, you can watch Love Letters for incarcerated fathers. This work is part of our continued commitment to\u00a0raising awareness about racial injustice, and to\u00a0bearing witness\u00a0to the human costs of mass incarceration.\u00a0The costs of mass incarceration have disproportionately affected the lives of Black men. From 1980 to 2007, about\u00a0one in three\u00a0of the 25.4 million adults arrested for drugs was African-American. And if that current trend continues, one in three Black boys born today can expect to spend time in prison during his lifetime. All in all, we\u2019re now at a point where there are\u00a0more African-American men incarcerated\u00a0in the U.S. than the total prison populations of India, Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Germany, Finland, Israel and England combined.\nMany of these men are also fathers\u2014and their children have suffered greatly. The loss of a father to incarceration adversely affects children\u2019s educational, social and emotional well-being, even decades later. Children with an incarcerated parent are three times more likely to have behavioral problems or depression, and at least twice as likely to suffer from learning disabilities, ADD/ADHD, and anxiety.\u00a0\nThis is what Love Letters conveys: the hurt of the children left behind\u2014and the enduring bond between a child and a parent despite the barrier of prison walls. So for Father's Day, we worked with the NGOs Pops the Club and Place4Grace to encourage children and youth in California to share their love letters to their fathers behind bars. We're also working with the California Department of Corrections to share the video with fathers behind bars throughout the state.\nTo learn about criminal justice reform legislation now going through Congress, visit sentencingproject.org, vera.org, or brennancenter.org. As David Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s vice president of corporate development, said at an event this week: \u201cWe like disruption, and if there\u2019s a system worth disrupting, it\u2019s the criminal justice system.\u201d We hope that by raising awareness about the impact of mass incarceration on children and families, we can help to change it.

But the Internet is upending this model and opening the door for the over three billion people already online to exchange goods, services, and ideas.\nToday, a small business can sell its products overseas with little more than an app or website. An artist, musician, or author can reach a global audience without needing a superstar agent.  A small business on Bainbridge Island, Washington sells its marine parts to customers in 176 countries, and a unique performer like Lindsey Stirling cultivates a global audience with millions of views on YouTube.\nThe Internet is profoundly changing the global economy -- democratizing who participates in trade, transforming the way traditional industries do business, and internationalizing the way people around the world connect. Today, information flows contribute more than the flow of physical goods to global economic growth.\nBut Internet restrictions -- like censorship, site-blocking, and forced local storage of data -- threaten the Internet\u2019s open architecture. This can seriously harm established businesses, startups trying to reach a global audience, and Internet users seeking to communicate and collaborate across national borders.\nTrade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are beginning to recognize the Internet\u2019s transformative impact on trade.\nThe Internet has revolutionized how people can share and access information, and the TPP promotes the free flow of information in ways that are unprecedented for a binding international agreement. The TPP requires the 12 participating countries to allow cross-border transfers of information and prohibits them from requiring local storage of data. These provisions will support the Internet\u2019s open architecture and make it more difficult for TPP countries to block Internet sites -- so that users have access to a web that is global, not just local.\u00a0\nThe TPP provides strong copyright protections, while also requiring fair and reasonable copyright exceptions and limitations that protect the Internet. It balances the interests of copyright holders with the public\u2019s interest in the wider distribution and use of creative works -- enabling innovations like search engines, social networks, video recording, the iPod, cloud computing, and machine learning. The endorsement of balanced copyright is unprecedented for a trade agreement. The TPP similarly requires the kinds of copyright safe harbors that have been critical to the Internet\u2019s success, with allowances for some variation to account for different legal systems.\u00a0\nThe TPP advances other important Internet policy goals. It prohibits discrimination against foreign Internet services, limits governments\u2019 ability to demand access to encryption keys or other cryptographic methods, requires pro-innovation telecom access policies, prohibits customs duties on digital products, requires proportionality in intellectual property remedies, and advances other key digital goals.\u00a0\nThe TPP is not perfect, and the trade negotiation process could certainly benefit from greater transparency.  We will continue to advocate for process reforms, including the opportunity for all stakeholders to have a meaningful opportunity for input into trade negotiations.\nIn terms of substance, we believe that future trade agreements can do even more to build a modern pro-innovation, pro-Internet trade agenda. For example, while the TPP\u2019s balanced copyright provisions can be a force for good, these balancing provisions should be expanded in future agreements.\nWe hope that the TPP can be a positive force and an important counterweight to restrictive Internet policies around the world.  Like many other tech companies, we look forward to seeing the agreement approved and implemented in a way that promotes a free and open Internet across the Pacific region.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

A rounded education should prepare young people for online life -- it's as essential as literacy and numeracy. And it should be accessible to everyone: we\u2019re particularly pleased that more than 40% of participants in our online workshops so far have been women. And it\u2019s not just for the young - for instance in The Netherlands, of the thousands of people that attended training sessions in Dutch cities, over half are older than 45 years. \nWe believe all this dovetails with the aims set out by the European Commission. Europe is looking to the future, and good digital skills give people the tools to excel in their jobs, start their own businesses and fully participate in contemporary life. \nAs emphasized in this recent report by BCG, we need to get better at matching the skills of the workforce with the skills required in new jobs.

The focus of this year\u2019s CEM was to discuss how to achieve the goals set in the Paris climate change deal as well as learn how innovations coming out of Silicon Valley are tackling the issue head on.\nHosted by U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, a number of ministers embarked on a fact finding mission that included Google, where they came to learn first hand about our commitment to clean energy and sustainability.\nGoogle\u2019s Senior Vice President for Technical Infrastructure Urs H\u00f6lzle told the group that renewable energy is critical for businesses like ours \u2014 from powering our data centers to our products and services.  \u201cHaving pioneered some of the first corporate renewable power purchasing back in 2010-2011, we\u2019re excited to see that this is becoming business-as-usual for companies everywhere. And at Google we continue to be committed to 100% renewable energy because this makes good business sense and is the right thing to do for the planet and for our users.\u201d\nU.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz who led the visit to Google was joined by ministers and officials from countries including the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Chile, India, Indonesia, and South Africa.\nU.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. who led the visit to Google, was joined by ministers and officials from countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Chile, India, Indonesia, and South Africa.\nThe CEM group had the opportunity to see at first hand a number of projects aimed at everything from helping people make smart choices about\u00a0solar power\u00a0to how we power our\u00a0data centers\u00a0with renewable energy.At Google, we\u2019ve made a\u00a0long-term commitment\u00a0to power 100% of our operations with renewable energy. To that end,\u00a0we\u2019ve purchased more than 2 gigawatts of renewable energy\u00a0to date, making us the world\u2019s largest non-utility purchaser of renewables.In an effort to build on this week\u2019s momentum, the CEM launched a campaign that will promote solutions that enable more companies to purchase renewable power. Google is pleased to join this effort by agreeing to host a forum later this year for national governments, renewable energy buyers and suppliers, NGOs, and other interested groups to look for ways to further unlock corporate renewable energy demand in CEM countries.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

We\u2019re republishing the op-ed in English below.\u00a0For hundreds of years, it has been an accepted rule of law that one country should not have the right to impose its rules on the citizens of other countries. As a result, information that is illegal in one country can be perfectly legal in others: Thailand outlaws insults to its king; Brazil outlaws negative campaigning in political elections; Turkey outlaws speech that denigrates Ataturk or the Turkish nation \u2014 but each of these things is legal elsewhere. \u00a0As a company that operates globally, we work hard to respect these differences.\u00a0In March, the French data protection regulator (the CNIL) ordered that its interpretation of French law protecting the right to be forgotten should apply not just in France, but in every country in the world. \u00a0\u00a0The right to be forgotten - more accurately, a right to be delisted from search results - was created in a landmark 2014 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). It lets Europeans delist certain links from search engine results generated by searches for their name, even when those links point to truthful and lawfully published information like newspaper articles or official government websites.\u00a0Google complies with the European Court\u2019s ruling in every country in the EU. Our approach reflects the criteria set out by the CJEU, as well as guidance from each country\u2019s regulators and courts about the nuances of their local data protection rules. Across Europe we\u2019ve now reviewed nearly 1.5 million webpages, delisting around 40%. In France alone, we\u2019ve reviewed over 300,000 webpages, delisting nearly 50%.\u00a0Following feedback from European regulators, we recently expanded our approach, restricting access to delisted links on all Google Search services viewed from the country of the person making the request. \u00a0(We also remove the link from results on other EU country domains.) That means that if we detect you\u2019re in France, and you search for someone who had a link delisted under the right to be forgotten, you won\u2019t see that link anywhere on Google Search - regardless of which domain you use. \u00a0Anyone outside the EU will continue see the link appear on non-European domains in response to the same search query.\u00a0\u00a0The CNIL's latest order, however, requires us to go even further, applying the CNIL\u2019s interpretation of French law to every version of Google Search globally. This would mean removing links to content - which may be perfectly legal locally - from Australia (google.com.au) to Zambia (google.co.zm) and everywhere in between, including google.com.\u00a0As a matter of both law and principle, we disagree with this demand. We comply with the laws of the countries in which we operate. But if French law applies globally, how long will it be until other countries - perhaps less open and democratic - start demanding that their laws regulating information likewise have global reach? \u00a0This order could lead to a global race to the bottom, harming access to information that is perfectly lawful to view in one\u2019s own country. For example, this could prevent French citizens from seeing content that is perfectly legal in France. This is not just a hypothetical concern. We have received demands from governments to remove content globally on various grounds -- and we have resisted, even if that has sometimes led to the blocking of our services.\u00a0In defense of this foundational principle of international law, we today filed our appeal of the CNIL\u2019s order with France\u2019s Supreme Administrative Court, the Conseil d\u2019Etat. We look forward to the Court\u2019s review of this case, which we hope will maintain the rights of citizens around the world to access legal information.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Unfortunately, not all ads are \u2014 some are for fake or harmful products, or seek to mislead users about the businesses they represent. We have an extensive set of policies to keep bad ads out of our systems \u2014 in fact in 2015 alone, we disabled more than 780 million ads for reasons ranging from counterfeiting to phishing. Ads for financial services are a particular area of vigilance given how core they are to people\u2019s livelihood and well being.\nIn that vein, today we\u2019re sharing an update that will go into effect on July 13, 2016: we\u2019re banning ads for payday loans and some related products from our ads systems. We will no longer allow ads for loans where repayment is due within 60 days of the date of issue. In the U.S., we are also banning ads for loans with an APR of 36% or higher. When reviewing our policies, research has shown that these loans can result in unaffordable payment and high default rates for users so we will be updating our policies globally to reflect that.\nThis change is designed to protect our users from deceptive or harmful financial products and will not affect companies offering loans such as Mortgages, Car Loans, Student Loans, Commercial loans, Revolving Lines of Credit (e.g. Credit Cards).\nAccording to Wade Henderson, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, \"This new policy addresses many of the longstanding concerns shared by the entire civil rights community about predatory payday lending. These companies have long used slick advertising and aggressive marketing to trap consumers into outrageously high interest loans \u2014 often those least able to afford it.\"\nWe\u2019ll continue to review the effectiveness of this policy, but our hope is that fewer people will be exposed to misleading or harmful products.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nAds\n  "}

This is a critical issue in the United States, which represents 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, but 25 percent of the world\u2019s prison population. And Blacks are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of whites\u2014in fact, the United States imprisons a larger percentage of its Black population than South Africa did at the height of apartheid. \nAn often overlooked fact of mass incarceration is that many first-time, nonviolent offenders who receive prison sentences are parents. There are 2.7 million American children with a parent behind bars, and Black children are 7.5 times more likely to have a parent behind bars than their white counterparts. The experience of having a parent in prison is traumatizing to a child: a new study from the Annie E. Casey Foundation found that the incarceration of a parent can have as much impact on a child\u2019s well-being as abuse or domestic violence. \nSo this Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, in an effort to raise awareness of the impact of mass incarceration, we\u2019ve partnered with NGOs on Love Letters: a series of videos that contain children\u2019s messages of love for a mother or father in prison. These digital love letters are demonstrations of the unbreakable love between parent and child, and of the pain of growing up without a parent present.\nThe videos reveal a side of mass incarceration that many people don\u2019t get a chance to see. They allow us to bear witness, to be proximate to the very human costs of incarceration. Before I joined Google, I spent years as a human rights lawyer working on criminal justice reform. When I visited women\u2019s prisons, I saw how broken women prisoners were because almost all were mothers to small children. Few received visits from family or children because of how remote women\u2019s prisons usually are. When children did visit, some weren\u2019t allowed to hug or touch their mothers. I also visited detention centers for girls, where many were the daughters of incarcerated mothers. The girls had been trafficked or arrested for running away from group homes or abusive foster placements, and they shared with me the pain of not having a mother there to teach them and protect them.\u00a0\n10:25\nThe impact of mass incarceration is generational and devastating. I hope that after\u00a0watching these videos,\u00a0you\u2019ll choose to learn more about the critical work organizations like\u00a0The Osborne Association,\u00a0Hour Children, and Google.org grantees\u00a0Essie Justice Group, the\u00a0Ella Baker Center\u00a0and the\u00a0Equal Justice Initiative\u00a0are doing to support children affected by incarceration and to advance criminal justice reform.

Currently, three billion of the world's seven billion people are connected to the internet; by 2020 it'll be five billion. If women aren't included as equal partners in this internet revolution, we all stand to lose. That's why this week, we teamed up with Debating Europe to host a Women & Tech event in Brussels with EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, Google Europe\u2019s President Matt Brittin, and wired women from around the world to highlight the impact of tech on women and of women on tech.\nWomen are still vastly underrepresented in the tech sector. We make up only 30% of the workforce in the ICT sector, and 19% of digital entrepreneurs -- compared to over 30% in other sectors. This disparity begins in education, where we have a lower participation rate worldwide in science, technology maths and engineering subjects.\nEU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1\nJourov\u00e1 set the tone, noting that we shouldn\u2019t just talk about change, but make it happen. She told us about the vital work the European Commission is doing in this area, for instance by contributing to the Girls in ICT project. But there\u2019s still a lot of work on the same basic point: we need to increase the number of women working in tech.\nTo solve a problem, you need data. Google's aim is to organise the world's information, and one of our speakers, Lucy Hurst, had plenty to share. She co-authored The Economist Intelligence Unit's report on the gender gap, which showed that in some countries inequality between men and women is getting worse. \nNext, you need enthusiasm, and a will to change. One of the most inspiring speakers we heard from was Hayla Ghazal -- a Dubai-based YouTube star who was recently made a UN Change Ambassador. She mentioned that in one of her videos -- which offer a light-hearted look at everything from pre-exam panic to satirical differences between Arab and Western mothers -- she talked about her love of reading. Soon after, parents were thanking her for encouraging their daughters to read.\nShe also told us about the importance of having a diverse range of female role models worldwide; about how women can discover economic and educational opportunities online; and that everyone benefits when women around the world are connected, educated, and able to use their capabilities to the full.\nFrom Google, we invited Yvonne Agyei, our Vice President of People Operations.We know the most exciting ideas come from unexplored places: that's why with hiring, we extend our reach beyond traditional universities, helping us discover the talent of underrepresented groups, including women. We also invest in partnerships across the continent to get young people excited about computer science, like Lero\u2019s Summer Computing Camp for Girls in Ireland. \nWe\u2019re pleased with the results, even though there\u2019s clearly more to do. So far, 37% of Campus London community members are female, and 33% of our Madrid members are female. Our Campus Directors in London and Madrid - Sarah Drinkwater and Sofia Benjumea - are doing an amazing job in supporting greater diversity in local start-up communities. Of all the startups that make up our Campus community, 40% have a woman in the \u2018founder\u2019 team.\nAll of this fits in with our wider goal of training 2 million Europeans in digital skills -- in fact, 43% of participants in our digital workshops, so far, are women. They include Romanian folk blouse retailers and a cat grooming service in The Netherlands. \nThere's a lot to be optimistic about, but there's a great deal of work to be done as well. Great companies rely on great people -- and if women aren\u2019t included, half the talent pool is absent. We want more stories like Mame Khary Diene, and her start-up BioEssence, more YouTubers like Hayla and her friends sharing their excitement about gender equality, and more coding workshops for girls like the ones run by Cheryl D. Miller of the Digital Leadership Institute. We look forward to training hundreds of thousands of girls and women in digital skills over the next few years.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nDiversity and Inclusion\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

It\u2019s fitting that Google helped document President Barack Obama and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s tour of the Fair with several 360-degree cameras \u2014 a perfect way to combine digital and industry in front of an international audience. The video allows you join the delegation of the two heads of state for a virtual tour you can watch on YouTube, or by using a virtual-reality (VR) viewer like Google Cardboard. \u00a0Before the tour gets started, U.S. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker explains the importance of the President\u2019s trip to Germany and the collaboration between U.S. and German business. It\u2019s a great opportunity to see the Fair, take a look at the booths of economic development delegations from most of the 50 United States, and catch a glimpse of some of the happenings taking place in the middle of the\u00a0Select USA\u00a0partner country area.\nOne stop on the tour was the JobsOhio booth, where the President and Chancellor viewed a demo of a made-in-Ohio 3D printer. Take a look at the demo, and then turn around to see the press capturing their visit.  The President\u2019s Press Secretary Josh Earnest concludes the video in front of the Young Tech Enterprises show floor, where Google sponsored space for emerging startups to showcase their innovations.\nGoogle was thrilled to host promising startups like:\u00a0INFARM working to help cities with efficient food production; RELAYR providing an innovative enterprise middleware platform; WATLY combining a solar water purifier with power and connectivity; DAS TERMINAL offering digital banners and marketing solutions; KIWI providing hands-free access solutions for apartment buildings; UNU tackling the challenges of urban mobility through innovative e-scooters; and Beaconinside offering integrated next generation indoor location-based experiences.\nSo how'd we do VR? We used a mix of 4K cameras that are positioned to take pictures in every direction. We then used software in post-production to help stitch together the picture to transport you right into the action! The cameras were provided by our YouTube spaces in Berlin, London, and Paris in true European collaboration.\n360-degree cameras and virtual reality are unique technologies to experience events like the Hannover trade show through a new perspective. If you couldn\u2019t get to Hannover this year, seeing this incredible industrial fair in 360 might be the next best thing.

The unanimous approval of the Email Privacy Act is a testament to the broad bipartisan support for this commonsense reform.  Representatives Yoder (R-Kan.), Polis (D-Colo.), Goodlatte (R-Va.), and Conyers (D-Mich.) have been real leaders in helping to shepherd this important bill through the House of Representatives.\nEnacted in 1986, ECPA makes distinctions that simply don\u2019t match with what users reasonably should expect of privacy in 2016.  An email, for example, may receive more robust privacy protections under ECPA depending on how old it is or whether it is in an opened or unopened state.  Users don\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t expect that communications they send through or information they store with a provider will enjoy lower privacy protection based on these arbitrary and nonsensical distinctions.\nThe Email Privacy Act replaces the confusing array of rules that govern when the government can compel a provider to disclose user information with a simple warrant-for-content rule.  In many ways, the Email Privacy Act is a modest, though important, codification of the status quo; it implements the 6th Circuit\u2019s conclusion in 2010 that ECPA is unconstitutional to the extent it would permit the government to compel a service provider to disclose to the government a user\u2019s electronic communications content without a warrant.  This warrant-for-content rule has been observed by Google and other companies and the government alike since 2010.\nThe version of the Email Privacy Act that passed the House of Representatives today is the result of robust debate to address a broad array of competing concerns.  We urge the Senate to move swiftly toward passage of this bill, and to reject further changes that would weaken the warrant-for-content rule reflected in the Email Privacy Act.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

And it has let developers of all sizes easily reach huge audiences.\u00a0The result? \u00a0Users enjoy extraordinary choices of apps and devices at ever-lower prices. \u00a0\u00a0The European Commission has been investigating our approach, and today issued a Statement of Objections, raising questions about its impact on competition. We take these concerns seriously, but we also believe that our business model keeps manufacturers\u2019 costs low and their flexibility high, while giving consumers unprecedented control of their mobile devices. That\u2019s how we designed the model: \u00a0 \u00a0\nOur partner agreements are entirely voluntary -- anyone can use Android without Google. Try it\u2014you can download the entire operating system for free, modify it how you want, and build a phone. And major companies like Amazon do just that.\u00a0\nManufacturers who want to participate in the Android ecosystem commit to test and certify that their devices will support Android apps. Without this system, apps wouldn\u2019t work from one Android device to the next. \u00a0Imagine how frustrating it would be if an app you downloaded on one Android phone didn\u2019t also work on your replacement Android phone from the same manufacturer. \u00a0\nAny manufacturer can then choose to load the suite of Google apps to their device and freely add other apps as well. \u00a0For example, phones today come loaded with scores of pre-installed apps (from Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Google, mobile carriers, and more). \nOf course while Android is free for manufacturers to use, it\u2019s costly to develop, improve, keep secure, and defend against patent suits. \u00a0We provide Android for free, and offset our costs through the revenue we generate on our Google apps and services we distribute via Android. \nAnd it\u2019s simple and easy for users to personalize their devices and download apps on their own -- including apps that directly compete with ours. \u00a0The popularity of apps like Spotify, WhatsApp, Angry Birds, Instagram, Snapchat and many more show how easy it is for consumers to use new apps they like. Over 50 billion apps have been downloaded on Android.\nOur partner agreements have helped foster a remarkable -- and, importantly, sustainable -- ecosystem, based on open-source software and open innovation.

That means reliable and affordable electricity is integral to the continued growth and operation of all of our businesses and the services we offer to our users everywhere. We are all committed to sourcing our power in a sustainable way, and renewable energy makes good business sense for us all.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \nAt Google, we have been carbon neutral since 2007.  We have signed contracts to purchase over 2GW of renewable energy\u00a0\u2014\u00a0equivalent to taking nearly one million cars off the road\u00a0\u2014\u00a0making us the largest non-utility renewable energy\u00a0purchaser in the world.  Just last year we signed the largest and most diverse purchase of renewable energy made by a non-utility company to power our data centers. The deal covers a series of new wind and solar projects around the world and takes us one step closer to our goal of powering 100% of our operations with clean energy.  Above and beyond our own power purchases, we have also invested more than $2.5 billion in 22 other renewable projects around the world. \nThese efforts underline the seriousness of our commitment to renewables\u00a0and we believe the CPP is an important step in the transition to a cleaner energy future. The message from our companies today is clear \u2014 we can meet the world\u2019s future energy challenges in a way that drives innovation and growth while tackling climate change.\nPOSTED IN:\nSustainability\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Likewise, millions of artists, authors, developers, and publishers are creating apps, movies, music, books, and more for global audiences, on a growing number of platforms and digital outlets.  Almost everyone with a smartphone, tablet or laptop is taking part in Internet-driven trade.\nAt the same time, large companies in sectors from advanced manufacturing to agriculture are using the Internet to transform how they do business.\nTogether, these changes are having a remarkable impact on trade.  Data flows enabled by the Internet \u2014 practically non-existent just 15 years ago \u2014 now contribute to global economic growth more than the flow of goods.\nGovernments are rightly taking note of this transformation.  In agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, negotiators have started to address Internet issues.  They are starting to recognize that restrictive Internet policies can damage trade just as much as high tariffs and quotas.\nTrade agreements can be a force for good for the global free and open Internet.  They can counter the balkanization or fragmentation of the Internet into disconnected local networks.  They can promote access to information.  And they can make it easier for a small startup to get off the ground, reach new markets, and challenge competitors anywhere across the globe.\nFor trade and Internet policy to work together, trade negotiators need to have input from the full range of Internet stakeholders.  At the same time, Internet stakeholders need to start engaging in the trade policy process.  Small businesses, startups, civil society groups, the Internet technical community, and everyday users all have a stake.\nThe bad news: the traditionally closed and complex nature of trade negotiations makes engagement by this broader range of stakeholders difficult.The good news: key players increasingly see the need to increase participation and transparency.Former trade negotiators are urging governments to \"solicit public comments on contentious proposals\" rather than relying on input only from a small group of cleared advisors. They worry that excessive secrecy is feeding into negative public perceptions of trade.Former White House staffers are putting forward ideas to build more open debate into trade policy developmentGroups representing Internet users, consumers, and scholars are brainstorming how to modernize trade policy and build public trust.Trade negotiators in the European Union and US are beginning to explore new approaches.Increasing transparency is a win-win proposition. If we've learned anything from the Internet's history, it's that bringing more voices to the table can produce better outcomes for all. We look forward to continuing the conversation and working with the Internet and trade communities to build out these ideas.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

For instance, we didn\u2019t think it was clear how the program would be implemented for video services that were not included in the \u201cfree streaming\u201d portion of the Binge On program. We also thought users needed more help to understand how the program worked and how to exercise their options.\nOver the last several months, we raised these concerns with T-Mobile, and they\u2019ve heard us and others who provided similar feedback. We\u2019re glad T-Mobile will continue to improve the program for all users and video providers by:\nImproving notice and choice for users: T-Mobile has been clarifying for users what \u2018optimization\u2019 means as well as the impact of turning Binge On on or off. And for those who want to turn it off, they\u2019ve made it easier to do so \u2014 rather than having to click through a series of menu items, users can now turn the setting off with an SMS short code and with two clicks from the T-Mobile app and one click from the my.tmobile.com site. Any user can toggle Binge On off and on, and the change will take effect within minutes \u2014 which significantly improves the user experience.\u00a0\nImproving information and choice for video services: While T-Mobile has always stated that any video service can join the program at no charge, prior to our discussions, video services were not given a choice about whether their streams would be managed by T-Mobile if they did not join the program. Going forward, any video service meeting traffic-identification requirements will be able to opt-out, and T-Mobile will stop including them in the Binge On program and will no longer modify their video streams. In addition, T-Mobile will now work with video services that wish to optimize their own streams, using an average data rate limit. This allows video services to offer users an improved video experience, even at lower data rates, by taking advantage of innovations such as video compression technology, benefiting T-Mobile, their customers, and video providers.\u00a0\nWe think these changes, which T-Mobile is making for all users and video providers on a non-preferential basis, can help ensure that the program works well for all users and the entire video ecosystem. As a result, YouTube and Google Play Movies & TV are participating in Binge On. Starting today, if you're a T-Mobile user with Binge On enabled, when you watch YouTube or a movie or TV show on Google Play, it won't count against your data cap. We hope our users enjoy this new option.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nYouTube\n  \nGoogle Play\n  "}

We\u2019ll be implementing the change next week. \nThe right to be forgotten \u2014 or, more accurately, the \u201cright to delist\u201d \u2014 was established by the Court of Justice of the European Union in 2014. It allows Europeans to ask search engines to delist certain links from the set of search results generated by a search query for their name. \nAt the moment, if someone submits a URL for delisting via our webform and we determine that their request meets the criteria set by the Court (the information to be delisted must be inadequate, irrelevant, no longer relevant or excessive, and not in the public interest), then we will delist the URL from the search results generated in response to a search for their name. Our current practice is to delist from all European versions of Google Search (like google.de, google.fr, google.co.uk, etc) simultaneously.\nStarting next week, in addition to our existing practice, we will also use geolocation signals (like IP addresses) to restrict access to the delisted URL on all Google Search domains, including google.com, when accessed from the country of the person requesting the removal. We\u2019ll apply the change retrospectively, to all delistings that we have already done under the European Court ruling. \nSo for example, let\u2019s say we delist a URL as a result of a request from John Smith in the United Kingdom. Users in the UK would not see the URL in search results for queries containing [john smith] when searching on any Google Search domain, including google.com. Users outside of the UK could see the URL in search results when they search for [john smith] on any non-European Google Search domain.\nWe\u2019re changing our approach as a result of specific discussions that we\u2019ve had with EU data protection regulators in recent months. We believe that this additional layer of delisting enables us to provide the enhanced protections that European regulators ask us for, while also upholding the rights of people in other countries to access lawfully published information.\nSince May 2014, we\u2019ve worked hard to find the right balance as we implement the European Court\u2019s ruling. Despite occasional disagreements, we\u2019ve maintained a collaborative dialogue with data protection authorities throughout. We\u2019re committed to continuing to work in this way.\nPOSTED IN:\nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

Google has already committed to purchase more renewable energy than any other company. Now, through a series of new wind and solar projects around the world, we\u2019re one step closer to our commitment to\u00a0triple our purchases of renewable energy by 2025\u00a0and our goal of powering 100% of our operations with clean energy.842 MW of renewable energy around the worldToday\u2019s agreements will add an additional 842 megawatts of renewable energy capacity to power our data centers. Across three countries, we\u2019re nearly doubling the amount of renewable energy we\u2019ve purchased to date. We\u2019re now up to 2 gigawatts\u2014the equivalent to taking nearly 1 million cars off the road.These additional 842 megawatts represent a range of locations and technologies, from a wind farm in Sweden to a solar plant in Chile.\nThese long-term contracts range from 10-20 years and provide projects with the financial certainty and scale necessary to build these wind and solar facilities\u2014thus bringing new renewable energy onto the grid in these regions. For our part, these contracts not only help minimize the environmental impact of our services\u2014they also make good business sense by ensuring good prices.Our commitment to a sustainable energy futureSince we opened our\u00a0very first owned data center\u00a0in 2006, we\u2019ve been working to promote renewable and sustainable energy use in several ways:First, we\u2019re building the world\u2019s most efficient computer infrastructure by\u00a0designing our data centers\u00a0to use as little energy as possible.Second, we're driving the renewables industry forward by fully committing to renewable sources. In 2010, we entered our first large-scale\u00a0renewable power purchase agreement\u00a0with a wind farm in Iowa,\u00a0and we subsequently completed a number of similar large-scale energy purchases over the past five years.\u00a0Today\u2019s announcement is another milestone in this area.Third, we've worked with our utility partners to help promote transformation in the utility sector. In 2013 we\u00a0created a new program\u00a0that enables customers like Google to buy large amounts of renewable energy directly from their utilities. Today's announcement includes the\u00a0first solar project enrolled under that program. And this past summer we announced that our newest data center will be on\u00a0located on the site of a retiring coal plant\u00a0and will be 100% renewable powered from day one.Fourth, beyond our efforts to power our own operations with renewables, we\u2019ve made separate agreements to\u00a0fund $2.5 billion\u00a0into 22 large-scale renewable energy projects over the last five years, from Germany to Kansas to Kenya. These investments have been in some of the largest and most transformative renewable energy projects in the world with a goal to help drive renewable energy development not only as a customer but as an investor, and bring down costs for everyone.And we\u2019re also working on new technologies and ideas\u2014ranging from\u00a0Project Sunroof\u00a0to\u00a0Makani Power\u00a0to\u00a0air quality monitoring\u2014that we hope can make a cleaner energy future an option for many more people.With world leaders coming together at the\u00a0COP21 UN conference on climate change\u00a0in Paris this week, there's no better time to focus on renewable energy.

Already, many governments are putting forth ambitious emissions reduction goals. And companies are taking action, too, by reducing their own footprints and investing in clean energy.Reaching a strong deal in Paris is an absolute and urgent necessity. The data is clear and the science is beyond dispute: a warming planet poses enormous threats to society.Public health experts recently warned that climate change threatens to \u201cundermine the last half century of gains in development and global health,\u201d through forces like extreme weather, drought, malnutrition, and disease. The U.S. government has asserted that climate change poses \u201cimmediate risks to U.S. national security,\u201d as increased natural disasters and humanitarian crises fuel instability and violence. And many studies have revealed that critical infrastructure, like electricity and water, is vulnerable to rising sea levels and intensifying storms.Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. Rising to that challenge involves a complex mix of policy, technology, and international cooperation. This won\u2019t be easy, but Google is committed to doing its part.Google has been carbon neutral since 2007. Our data centers, the physical infrastructure behind web services used by billions of people, now get 3.5 times the computing power out of the same amount of electricity, as compared to five years ago. We are also the biggest corporate purchaser of renewable power on the planet. Just today at the White House, we pledged to triple those purchases over the next decade. In addition, we're a major climate-minded investor, so far committing more than $2 billion to clean energy projects, from America\u2019s largest wind farm to Africa\u2019s largest solar power plant.We're serious about environmental sustainability not because it\u2019s trendy, but because it\u2019s core to our values and also makes good business sense. After all, the cheapest energy is the energy you don\u2019t use in the first place. And in many places clean power is cost-competitive with conventional power.We\u2019re making progress, but averting catastrophic climate change will require significant investment and bold innovations. Google and our private-sector peers are ready to lead. But something fundamental is required: clear policy. The global business community needs certainty to bring climate solutions to scale. We need the world\u2019s political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term and rooted in what science tells us needs to be done.It\u2019s encouraging to see the world\u2019s major economies set ambitious climate targets, but it\u2019s time to get a strong international climate agreement on the books. This December in Paris, it\u2019s imperative that policymakers reach a deal that moves us toward a zero-carbon economy. That\u2019s the kind of future that we\u2019re committed to helping build, and that future generations deserve.\nPOSTED IN:\nSustainability\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

We also work to make sure surveillance laws are transparent, principled, and reasonable.Today\u2019s Transparency Report updateWith this in mind, we\u2019re adding some new details to our Transparency Report that we\u2019re releasing today.Emergency disclosure requests.\u00a0We\u2019ve expanded our reporting on requests for information we receive in emergency situations. These emergency disclosure requests come from government agencies seeking information to save the life of a person who is in peril (like a kidnapping victim), or to prevent serious physical injury (like a threatened school shooting). We have a process for evaluating and fast-tracking these requests, and in true emergencies we can provide the necessary data without delay. The Transparency Report previously included this number for the United States, but we\u2019re now reporting for every country that submits this sort of request.Preservation requests.\u00a0We\u2019re also now reporting on government requests asking us to set aside information relating to a particular user\u2019s account. These requests can be made so that information needed in an investigation is not lost while the government goes through the steps to get the formal legal process asking us to disclose the information. We call these \"preservation requests\" and because they don't always lead to formal data requests, we keep them separate from the country totals we report. Beginning with this reporting period, we\u2019re reporting this number for every country.In addition to this new data, the report shows that we\u2019ve received 30,138 requests from around the world seeking information about more than 50,585 users/accounts; we provided information in response to 63 percent of those requests. We saw slight increases in the number of requests from governments in Europe (2 percent) and Asia/Pacific (7 percent), and a 22 percent increase in requests from governments in Latin America.The fight for increased transparencySometimes, laws and gag-orders prohibit us from notifying someone that a request for their data has been made. There are some situations where these restrictions make sense, and others not so much. We will fight\u2014sometimes through lengthy court action\u2014for our users\u2019 right to know when data requests have been made. We\u2019ve recently succeeded in a couple of important cases.First, after years of persistent litigation in which we fought for the right to inform Wikileaks of government requests for their data, we were successful in\u00a0unsealing court documents relating to these requests. We\u2019re now making those documents available to the public\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.Second, we've fought to be more transparent regarding the U.S. government's use of\u00a0National Security Letters, or NSLs. An NSL is a special type of subpoena for user information that the FBI issues without prior judicial oversight. NSLs can include provisions prohibiting the recipient from disclosing any information about it.\u00a0Reporters speculated in 2013\u00a0that we challenged the constitutionality of NSLs; after years of litigation with the government in several courts across multiple jurisdictions, we can now confirm that we challenged 19 NSLs and fought for our right to disclose this to the public. We also recently won the right to release additional information about those challenges and the documents should be available on the public court dockets soon.Finally, just yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 338-88 to pass the\u00a0USA Freedom Act of 2015. This represents a significant step toward broader surveillance reform, while preserving important national security authorities.

People used feature phones, which had very basic functionality, and were a nightmare for developers. The only way to build apps was device by device and platform by platform\u2014Google had a closet full of hundreds of phones that we tested one by one each time we wanted to launch new software.Android was born from this frustration. We hoped that by offering a great, free open-source operating system, we could turbocharge innovation by allowing manufacturers and developers to focus on what they do best. At the time, most people thought this plan was nuts.Fast forward to today. The pace of mobile innovation has never been greater. Smartphones are being adopted globally at an increasingly fast pace, with over hundreds of millions shipped each quarter, and the average smartphone price fell 23% between\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014. It\u2019s now possible to purchase a powerful smartphone, without subsidies or contracts, for under $100. And the app ecosystem has exploded, giving consumers more choice than ever before.Android has been a key player in spurring this competition and choice, lowering prices and increasing choice for everyone (there are over\u00a018,000\u00a0different devices available today);It\u2019s an open-source operating system that can be used\u00a0free-of-charge\u00a0by anyone\u2014that\u2019s right, literally anyone. And it\u2019s not just phones. Today people are building almost anything with Android\u2014including tablets, watches, TVs, cars, and more. Some Android devices use Google services, and\u00a0others\u00a0do not.Our Google Play store contains over one million apps and we paid out over $7 billion in revenue over the past year to developers and content publishers.Apps that compete directly with Google such as Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft Office, and Expedia are easily available to Android users. Indeed many of these apps come pre-loaded onto Android devices in addition to Google apps. The recent Samsung S6 is a great example of this, including pre-installed apps from Facebook, Microsoft, and Google.Developers have a choice of platforms and\u00a0over 80% of developers\u00a0are building apps for several different mobile operating systems.The European Commission has asked questions about our partner agreements. It's important to remember that these are voluntary\u2014again, you can use Android without Google\u2014but provide real benefits to Android users, developers and the broader ecosystem.Anti-fragmentation agreements, for example, ensure apps work across all sorts of different Android devices. (After all, it would be pretty frustrating if an app you downloaded on one phone didn\u2019t also work on your eventual replacement phone.) And our app distribution agreements make sure that people get a great \"out of the box\" experience with useful apps right there on the home screen (how many of us could get through our day without maps or email?). This also helps manufacturers of Android devices compete with Apple, Microsoft and other mobile ecosystems that come preloaded with similar baseline apps. And remember that these distribution agreements are not exclusive, and Android manufacturers install their own apps and apps from other companies as well. And in comparison to Apple\u2014the world\u2019s most profitable (mobile) phone company\u2014there are far fewer Google apps pre-installed on Android phones than Apple apps on iOS devices.We are thankful for Android\u2019s success and we understand that with success comes scrutiny. But it's not just Google that has benefited from Android's success. The Android model has let manufacturers compete on their unique innovations. Developers can reach huge audiences and build strong businesses. And consumers now have unprecedented choice at ever-lower prices. We look forward to discussing these issues in more detail with the European Commission over the months ahead.\nPOSTED IN:\nAndroid\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}
{"date": "2015-04-15 15:27:00+00:00", "title": "The Search for Harm", "category": "Public Policy", "url": "https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-search-for-harm/", "post_text": "In the summer of 2010, Google announced plans to acquire the flight search provider, ITA. As we said at the time, while many people buy their airline tickets online, finding the right flight at the best price can be a real hassle. Today Google Flight Search has made that much easier. Search for \"Flight CDG to SFO\" and you get the different options right there on the results page. It\u2019s a great example of Google\u2019s increasing ability to answer queries directly, saving people a lot of time and effort\u2014because as Larry Page said over a decade ago \u201cthe perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want.\"At the time of the ITA acquisition, several online travel companies\u2014Expedia, Kayak, and Travelocity--unsuccessfully lobbied regulators in the US and the European Union to block the deal, arguing that our ability to show flight options directly would siphon off their traffic and harm competition online. Four years later it\u2019s clear their allegations of harm turned out to be untrue.\u00a0As the Washington Post recently pointed out (in an article headed \u201cGoogle Flight Search, four years in: not the competition-killer critics feared\u201d) Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline and Travelocity account for 95% of the US online travel market today.\u00a0It\u2019s a similar situation in Europe too, as this graph for Germany neatly shows:Travel sites in Germany\nSource: ComScore MMX and Google data (for Google), desktop traffic, unique visitors (\u2018000s)\nWe\u2019ve seen similar\u00a0allegations\u00a0of harm from competitors in other areas. And the European Commission today confirmed that it is sending Google a Statement of Objections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping results.While Google may be the most used search engine, people can now find and access information in numerous different ways\u2014and allegations of harm, for consumers\u00a0and\u00a0competitors, have proved to be wide of the mark.More choice than ever beforeIn fact, people have more choice than ever before.There are numerous other search engines such as Bing, Yahoo, Quora, DuckDuckGo and a new wave of search assistants like Apple\u2019s Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana.In addition, there are a ton of specialized services like Amazon, Idealo, Le Guide, Expedia or eBay. For example, Amazon, eBay, and Axel Springer\u2019s Idealo are the three most popular shopping services in Germany.People are increasingly using social sites like Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter to find recommendations, such as where to eat, which movies to watch or how to decorate their homes.When it comes to news, users have many ways to reach their favorite sites. For example,\u00a0Bild\u00a0gets more than 85% of its traffic from sources other than Google and other search engines.*Of course mobile is changing things as well. Today\u00a07 out of every 8 minutes\u00a0on mobile devices is spent within apps\u2014in other words consumers are going to whichever websites or apps serve them best. And they face no friction or costs in switching between them. Yelp, for example, has told investors they get over 40% of their searches direct from their mobile apps.* So while in many ways it\u2019s flattering to be described as a gatekeeper, the facts don\u2019t actually bear that out.Thriving competition onlineWhich brings me to the competition. Companies like Axel Springer, Expedia, TripAdvisor, and Yelp (all vociferous complainants in this process) have alleged that Google\u2019s practice of including our specialized results (Flight Search, Maps, Local results, etc.) in search has significantly harmed their businesses. But their traffic, revenues and profits (as well as the pitch they make to investors) tell a very different story.Yelp calls itself the \u201cde facto local search engine\u201d and has seen revenue growth of over 350% in the last four years.TripAdvisor claims to be the Web\u2019s largest travel brand and has nearly doubled its revenues in the last four years.Expedia has grown its revenues by more than 67% over the same period\u2014and recently told investors:\u00a0\u201cWe're seeing increased traffic coming through Google Hotel Finder. It is \u00adclearly getting more exposure. And in general \u2026 the product continues to improve. And Google has invested in it, we'll continue to invest in it \u2026 From our standpoint, we're happy to play in any market that Google puts out there and over a long period of time, we have proven an ability to get our fair share in the Google marketplaces.\u201d\u00a0(Remarkable given their complaints.)Axel Springer continues to invest in search, including the French search engine Qwant, because as the company told investors, \u201cthere is a lot of innovation on the search market.\u201dIndeed if you look at shopping\u2014an area where we have seen a lot of complaints and where the European Commission has focused in its Statement of Objections\u2014it\u2019s clear that (a) there\u2019s a ton of competition (including from Amazon and eBay, two of the biggest shopping sites in the world) and (b) Google\u2019s shopping results have not harmed the competition. Take a look at these graphs:Shopping Sites in Germany\u00a0(unique visitors, \u2018000s)\nShopping Sites in France\u00a0(unique visitors, \u2018000s)\nShopping Sites in the UK\u00a0(unique visitors, \u2018000s)\nAny economist would say that you typically do not see a ton of innovation, new entrants or investment in sectors where competition is stagnating\u2014or dominated by one player. Yet that is exactly what\u2019s happening in our world. Zalando, the German shopping site, went public in 2014 in one of Europe\u2019s biggest-ever tech IPOs. Companies like Facebook, Pinterest and Amazon have been investing in their own search services and search engines like Quixey, DuckDuckGo and Qwant have attracted new funding. We\u2019re seeing innovation in voice search and the rise of search assistants\u2014with even more to come.It\u2019s why we respectfully\u00a0but\u00a0strongly disagree with the need to issue a Statement of Objections and look forward to making our case over the weeks ahead.*Update:\u00a0An earlier version of this post quoted traffic figures for\u00a0Bild\u00a0and\u00a0The Guardian, researched on a third-party site.\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0data were for the domain guardian.co.uk, which is no longer the main domain for the paper. We\u2019ve removed these references and we\u2019re sorry for the error. Yelp has pointed out that they get 40% of their searches (not their traffic) direct from their mobile apps. They don\u2019t appear to disclose their traffic numbers. We\u2019re happy to correct the record.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

We're republishing the op-ed in full below.\u00a0-Ed.When you search online, there\u2019s an unwritten assumption that you\u2019ll get an instant answer, as well as additional information if you need to dig deeper. This is all possible because of two decades worth of investment and innovation by many different companies. Today, however, search engines across Europe face a new challenge\u2014one we\u2019ve had just two months to get our heads around. That challenge is figuring out what information we must deliberately\u00a0omit\u00a0from our results, following a new ruling from the European Court of Justice.In the past we\u2019ve restricted the removals we make from search to a very short list. It includes information deemed illegal by a court, such as defamation, pirated content (once we\u2019re notified by the rights holder), malware, personal information such as bank details, child sexual abuse imagery and other things prohibited by local law (like material that glorifies Nazism in Germany).We\u2019ve taken this approach because, as article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\u00a0\u201cEveryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"But the European Court found that people have the right to ask for information to be removed from search results that include their names if it is \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive.\u201d In deciding what to remove, search engines must also have regard to the public interest. These are, of course, very vague and subjective tests. The court also decided that search engines don\u2019t qualify for a \u201cjournalistic exception.\u201d This means that\u00a0The Guardian\u00a0could have an article on its website about an individual that\u2019s perfectly legal, but we might not legally be able to show links to it in our results when you search for that person\u2019s name. It\u2019s a bit like saying the book can stay in the library, it just cannot be included in the library\u2019s card catalogue.It\u2019s for these reasons that we disagree with the ruling. That said, we obviously respect the court\u2019s authority and are doing our very best to comply quickly and responsibly. It\u2019s a huge task as we\u2019ve had over 70,000 take-down requests covering 250,000 webpages since May. So we now have a team of people individually reviewing each application, in most cases with limited information and almost no context.The examples we\u2019ve seen so far highlight the difficult value judgments search engines and European society now face: former politicians wanting posts removed that criticize their policies in office; serious, violent criminals asking for articles about their crimes to be deleted; bad reviews for professionals like architects and teachers; comments that people have written themselves (and now regret). In each case, someone wants the information hidden, while others might argue it should be out in the open.When it comes to determining what\u2019s in the the public interest, we\u2019re taking into account a number of factors. These include whether: the information relates to a politician, celebrity, or other public figure; if the material comes from a reputable news source, and how recent it is; whether it involves political speech; questions of professional conduct that might be relevant to consumers; the involvement of criminal convictions that are not yet \u201cspent\u201d; and if the information is being published by a government. But these will always be difficult and debatable judgments.We\u2019re also doing our best to be transparent about removals: for example, we\u2019re informing websites when one of their pages has been removed. But we cannot be specific about why we have removed the information because that could violate the individual\u2019s privacy rights under the court's decision.Of course, only two months in, our process is still very much a work in progress. It\u2019s why we incorrectly removed links to some articles last week (they have since been reinstated). But the good news is that the ongoing, active debate that\u2019s happening will inform the development of our principles, policies and practices\u2014in particular about how to balance one person\u2019s right to privacy with another\u2019s right to know.That\u2019s why we've also set up an\u00a0advisory council\u00a0of experts, the final membership of which we're announcing today. These external experts from the worlds of academia, the media, data protection, civil society and the tech sector are serving as independent advisors to Google. The council will be asking for evidence and recommendations from different groups, and will hold public meetings this autumn across Europe to examine these issues more deeply. Its public report will include recommendations for particularly difficult removal requests (like criminal convictions); thoughts on the implications of the court\u2019s decision for European Internet users, news publishers, search engines and others; and procedural steps that could improve accountability and transparency for websites and citizens.The issues here at stake are important and difficult, but we\u2019re committed to complying with the court\u2019s decision. Indeed it's hard not to empathize with some of the requests we've seen\u2014from the man who asked that we not show a news article saying he had been questioned in connection with a crime (he\u2019s able to demonstrate that he was never charged) to the mother who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter\u2019s name as she had been the victim of abuse. It\u2019s a complex issue, with no easy answers. So a robust debate is both welcome and necessary, as, on this issue at least, no search engine has an instant or perfect answer.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nGoogle in Europe\n  "}

In 1990, I wrote the first browser and editor. In 1993, after much urging, CERN declared that WWW technology would be available to all, without paying royalties, forever.\nThe first web server, used by Tim Berners-Lee. Photo via Wikipedia\nThis decision enabled tens of thousands to start working together to build the web.

By design, the underlying Internet and the WWW are non-hierarchical, decentralized and radically open. The web can be made to work with any type of information, on any device, with any software, in any language. You can link to any piece of information. You don\u2019t need to ask for permission. What you create is limited only by your imagination.So today is a day to celebrate. But it\u2019s also an occasion to think, discuss\u2014and do. Key decisions on the governance and future of the Internet are looming, and it\u2019s vital for all of us to speak up for the web\u2019s future. How can we ensure that the other 60 percent around the world who are not connected get online fast? How can we make sure that the web supports all languages and cultures, not just the dominant ones? How do we build consensus around open standards to link the coming Internet of Things? Will we allow others to package and restrict our online experience, or will we protect the magic of the open web and the power it gives us to say, discover, and create anything? How can we build systems of checks and balances to hold the groups that can spy on the net accountable to the public? These are some of my questions\u2014what are yours?On the 25th birthday of the web, I ask you to join in\u2014to help us imagine and build the future standards for the web, and to press for every country to develop a digital bill of rights to advance a free and open web for everyone. Learn more at\u00a0webat25.org\u00a0and speak up for the sort of web we really want with #web25.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

Today, for the eighth time, we\u2019re releasing new numbers showing\u00a0requests from governments to remove content\u00a0from our services. From January to June 2013, we received 3,846 government requests to remove 24,737 pieces of content\u2014a 68 percent increase over the second half of 2012.Over the past four years, one worrying trend has remained consistent: governments continue to ask us to remove political content. Judges have asked us to remove information that\u2019s critical of them, police departments want us to take down videos or blogs that shine a light on their conduct, and local institutions like town councils don\u2019t want people to be able to find information about their decision-making processes. These officials often cite defamation, privacy and even copyright laws in attempts to remove political speech from our services. In this particular reporting period, we received 93 requests to take down government criticism and removed content in response to less than one third of them. Four of the requests were submitted as copyright claims.You can read more about these requests in the\u00a0Notes\u00a0section of the Transparency Report. In addition, we saw a significant increase in the number of requests we received from two countries in the first half of 2013:There was a sharp increase in requests from\u00a0Turkey. We received 1,673 requests from Turkish authorities to remove content from our platforms, nearly a tenfold increase over the second half of last year. About two-thirds of the total requests\u20141,126 to be exact\u2014called for the removal of 1,345 pieces of content related to alleged violations of\u00a0law 5651.Another place where we saw an increase was\u00a0Russia, where there has been an uptick in requests since the list of prohibited information\u00a0took effect last fall. We received 257 removal requests during this reporting period, which is more than double the number of requests we received throughout 2012.While the information we present in our Transparency Report is certainly not a comprehensive view of censorship online, it does demonstrate a worrying upward trend in the number of government requests, and underscores the importance of transparency around the processes governing such requests. As we continue to add data, we hope it will become increasingly useful and informative in policy debates and decisions around the world.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  \nPublic Policy\n  "}

This comes as usage of our services continues to grow, but also as more governments have made requests than ever before.

We believe it\u2019s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know.Earlier this year, we brought a federal case to assert that we do indeed have the right to shine more light on the FISA process. In addition, we recently wrote\u00a0a letter of support\u00a0(PDF) for two pieces of legislation currently proposed in the U.S. Congress.

But did you know that every year approximately five new constitutions are written, and 20-30 are amended or revised? Or that Africa has the youngest set of constitutions, with 19 out of the 39 constitutions written globally since 2000 from the region?The process of redesigning and drafting a new constitution can play a critical role in uniting a country, especially following periods of conflict and instability. In the past, it\u2019s been difficult to access and compare existing constitutional documents and language\u2014which is critical to drafters\u2014because the texts are locked up in libraries or on the hard drives of constitutional experts. Although the process of drafting constitutions has evolved from chisels and stone tablets to pens and modern computers, there has been little innovation in how their content is sourced and referenced.With this in mind,\u00a0Google Ideas\u00a0supported the\u00a0Comparative Constitutions Project\u00a0to build\u00a0Constitute, a new site that digitizes and makes searchable the world\u2019s constitutions. Constitute enables people to browse and search constitutions via curated and tagged topics, as well as by country and year. The Comparative Constitutions Project cataloged and tagged nearly 350 themes, so people can easily find and compare specific constitutional material. This ranges from the fairly general, such as \u201cCitizenship\u201d and \u201cForeign Policy,\u201d to the very specific, such as \u201cSuffrage and turnouts\u201d and \u201cJudicial Autonomy and Power.\u201dOur aim is to arm drafters with a better tool for constitution design and writing.

As Google\u2019s CEO and Chief Legal Officer, we wanted you to have the facts.First, we have not joined any program that would give the U.S. government\u2014or any other government\u2014direct access to our servers. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access or a \u201cback door\u201d to the information stored in our data centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday.Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law. Our legal team reviews each and every request, and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don\u2019t follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users\u2019 data are false, period. Until this week\u2019s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received\u2014an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users\u2019 call records. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users\u2019 Internet activity on such a scale is completely false.Finally, this episode confirms what we have long believed\u2014there needs to be a more transparent approach. Google has worked hard, within the confines of the current laws, to be open about the data requests we receive. We post this information on our\u00a0Transparency Report\u00a0whenever possible. We were the first company to do this.

Today, for the seventh time, we\u2019re releasing new numbers showing\u00a0requests from governments to remove content\u00a0from our services. From July to December 2012, we received 2,285 government requests to remove 24,179 pieces of content\u2014an increase from the 1,811 requests to remove 18,070 pieces of content that we received during the first half of 2012.\nAs we\u2019ve gathered and released more data over time, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that the scope of government attempts to censor content on Google services has grown. In more places than ever, we\u2019ve been asked by governments to remove political content that people post on our services. In this particular time period, we received court orders in several countries to remove blog posts criticizing government officials or their associates.You can read more about these requests by looking at the\u00a0annotations\u00a0section of the Transparency Report. Of particular note were three occurrences that took place in the second half of 2012:There was a sharp increase in requests from\u00a0Brazil, where we received 697 requests to remove content from our platforms (of which 640 were court orders\u2014meaning we received an average of 3.5 court orders per day during this time period), up from 191 during the first half of the year. The big reason for the spike was the\u00a0municipal elections, which took place last fall. Nearly half of the total requests\u2014316 to be exact\u2014called for the removal of 756 pieces of content related to alleged violations of the\u00a0Brazilian Electoral Code, which forbids defamation and commentary that offends candidates. We\u2019re appealing many of these cases, on the basis that the content is protected by freedom of expression under the Brazilian Constitution.Another place where we saw an increase was from\u00a0Russia, where a\u00a0new law took effect\u00a0last fall. In the first half of 2012, we received six requests, the most we had ever received in any given six-month period from Russia. But in the second half of the year, we received 114 requests to remove content\u2014107 of them citing this new law.During this period, we received inquiries from 20 countries regarding YouTube videos containing clips of the movie \u201cInnocence of Muslims.\u201d While the videos were within our\u00a0Community Guidelines, we restricted videos from view in several countries in accordance with local law after receiving formal legal complaints. We also temporarily restricted videos from view in Egypt and Libya due to the particularly difficult circumstances there.We\u2019ve also made a couple of improvements to the Transparency Report since our last update:We\u2019re now breaking down government requests about YouTube videos to clarify whether we removed videos in response to government requests for violating Community Guidelines, or whether we restricted videos from view due to local laws. You can see the details by scrolling to the bottom of each country-specific page.We\u2019ve also refreshed the look of the\u00a0Traffic\u00a0section, making it easier to see where and when disruptions have occurred to Google services. You can see a map where our services are currently disrupted; you can see a map of all known disruptions since 2009; and you can more easily navigate between time periods and regions.The information we share on the Transparency Report is just a sliver of what happens on the Internet. But as we disclose more data and continue to expand it over time, we hope it helps draw attention to the laws around the world that govern the free flow of information online.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

When we receive these requests, we:scrutinize them carefully to ensure they satisfy the law and our policies;seek to narrow requests that are overly broad;notify users when appropriate so they can contact the entity requesting the information or consult a lawyer; andrequire that government agencies use a search warrant if they\u2019re seeking search query information or private content, like Gmail and documents, stored in a Google Account.When conducting national security investigations, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation can issue a National Security Letter (NSL) to obtain identifying information about a subscriber from telephone and Internet companies. The FBI has the authority to prohibit companies from talking about these requests. But we\u2019ve been trying to find a way to provide more information about the NSLs we get\u2014particularly as people have voiced concerns about the increase in their use since 9/11.Starting today, we\u2019re now including data about NSLs in our Transparency Report.

The conclusion is clear: Google\u2019s services are good for users and good for competition.Larry and Sergey founded Google because they believed that building a great search experience would improve people\u2019s lives. And in the decade-plus that\u2019s followed, Google has worked hard to make it quicker and easier for users to find what they need. In the early days you would type in a query, we\u2019d return 10 blue links and you\u2019d have to click on them individually to find what you wanted. Today we can save you the hassle by providing direct answers to your questions, as well as links to other sites. So if you type in [weather san francisco], or [tom hanks movies], we now give you the answer right from the results page\u2014because truly great search is all about turning your needs into actions in the blink of an eye.As we made clear when the FTC started its investigation, we\u2019ve always been open to improvements that\u00a0would create a better experience. And today\u00a0we\u2019ve written (PDF) to the FTC making two voluntary product changes:More choice for websites: Websites can already\u00a0opt out of\u00a0Google Search, and they can now remove content (for example reviews) from specialized search results pages, such as local, travel and shopping;More ad campaign control: Advertisers can already\u00a0export their ad campaigns\u00a0from Google AdWords. They will now be able to mix and copy ad campaign data within third-party services that use our AdWords API.In addition, we\u2019ve\u00a0agreed with the FTC\u00a0(PDF) that we will seek to resolve standard-essential patent disputes through a neutral third party before seeking injunctions.

Some proposals could allow governments to justify the censorship of legitimate speech, or even cut off Internet access in their countries.\nYou can read more about my concerns on\u00a0CNN.com,\u00a0but I am not alone. So far, more than 1,000 organizations from more than 160 countries have\u00a0spoken up too, and they\u2019re joined by hundreds of thousands of Internet users who are standing up for a free and open\u00a0Internet. On an interactive map at freeandopenweb.com, you can see\u00a0that people from all corners of the world have signed our petition, used the #freeandopen hashtag on social media, or created and uploaded videos to say how important these issues are.If you agree and want to support a free and open Internet too, I invite you to join us by signing the petition at google.com/takeaction. Please make your voice heard and spread the word.Update\u00a0December 15, 2012:\u00a0At the conclusion of the ITU meeting in Dubai on Friday, 89 countries signed the treaty, while 55 countries said they would not sign or that additional review was needed. We stand with the countries who refused to sign, and with the\u00a0millions of you\u00a0who have voiced your support for a free and open web.\nPOSTED IN:\nPublic Policy\n  "}

More than any time in history, more people in more places have the ability to have their voices heard.Powering these voices are billions of Internet connections around the world\u2014people on their mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops. The Internet is a powerful platform that makes it easier for people to speak, to assemble, and to be heard.
