But for speech to be truly free, we must also have the freedom to see or hear things that some people may consider objectionable. We believe that everyone has the right to make up their own minds about what to read, watch, or listen to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the power of freedom of speech.\nDespite our clear and consistent position, X has seen a number of attacks from activist groups like Media Matters and legacy media outlets who seek to undermine freedom of expression on our platform because they perceive it as a threat to their ideological narrative and those of their financial supporters. These groups try to use their influence to attack our revenue streams by deceiving advertisers on X.\nHere are the facts on Media Matters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 research:\nTo manipulate the public and advertisers, Media Matters created an alternate account and curated the posts and advertising appearing on the account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s timeline to misinform advertisers about the placement of their posts. These contrived experiences could be applied to any platform.\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce they curated their feed, they repeatedly refreshed their timelines to find a rare instance of ads serving next to the content they chose to follow. Our logs indicate that they forced a scenario resulting in 13 times the number of ads served compared to the median ads served to an X user.\u00c2\u00a0\nOf the 5.5 billion ad impressions on X that day, less than 50 total ad impressions were served against all of the organic content featured in the Media Matters article.\nFor one brand showcased in the article, one of its ads ran adjacent to a post 2 times and that ad was seen in that setting by only two users, one of which was the author of the Media Matters article.\nFor another brand showcased in the article, two of its ads served adjacent to 2 posts, 3 times, and that ad was only seen in that setting by one user, the author of the Media Matters article.\nMedia Matters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 article also highlights nine posts they believe should not be allowed on X. Upon evaluation, only one of the nine organic posts featured in the article violated our content policies, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken action on it under our Freedom of Speech, Not Reach enforcement approach.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a summary on this all: \nX will protect the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to free expression. We will not allow agenda-driven activists, or even our own profits, to deter our vision.\nEveryone has a choice on X. User and brand controls on X are superior to a year ago.\u00c2\u00a0\nData wins over allegations. Media Matters does not reflect the user experience on X.\nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in some parts of the world, when free expression is taken away, it is very dangerous and hard to get back \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the people who came before us fought so hard to protect. Without freedom of speech we lose the checks and balances critical to a thriving democracy. We must defend our individual rights as if our lives, and flourishing society, depend on it.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really in on protecting free speech, then we all need to protect it completely.\u00c2\u00a0\nStand with X to protect free speech.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

In times of uncertainty such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, our responsibility to protect the public conversation is magnified. From the onset of the conflict, we activated our crisis protocol and stood up the company to address the rapidly evolving situation with the highest level of urgency. That includes the formation of a cross-functional leadership team that has been working around the clock to ensure our global community has access to real-time information and to safeguard the platform for our users and partners. As we enter the second month of the conflict, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an update on the key proactive measures we have taken: Policy Enforcement X has a comprehensive set of policies designed to promote and protect the public conversation. Below is a summary of the key enforcement actions we have taken based on those policies in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict. Enforcement actions can include restricting the reach of a post, removing the post or account suspension. Additionally, such posts are not eligible for monetization. Safety and cybercrime:\nTo date, our escalations team has actioned over 325,000 pieces of content that violate our Terms of Service, including violent speech and hateful conduct.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken action under our Violent and Hateful Entities policy to remove over 3,000 accounts by violent entities in the region, including Hamas, since the start of the conflict.\nIn parallel, as we outlined in our update on this topic in September, we have expanded our proactive measures to automatically remediate against antisemitic content and provided our agents worldwide with a refresher course on antisemitism.\n Platform integrity and authenticity:\u00c2\u00a0\nOur escalations team has actioned over 25,000 pieces of content under our synthetic and manipulated media policy.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also taken action \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including suspension \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on over 375,000 accounts as a result of our proactive investigations to protect authentic conversation regarding the conflict, including coordinated/inauthentic engagement, inauthentic accounts, duplicate content and trending topic/hashtag spam. Additionally, we continue to investigate and disrupt coordinated campaigns to manipulate conversations related to the conflict.\n Exceptions to our Sensitive Media policy:\nWe know that it's sometimes incredibly difficult to see certain content, especially in moments like the one unfolding. While we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always allowed media that meets our definitions of Graphic Content (so long as it is placed behind a sensitive media warning interstitial), we generally remove content that meets our definitions of Gratuitous Gore. However, when certain newsworthy events occur X believes that it's in the public's interest to understand what's happening in real-time, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve allowed a range of media to remain on the platform (so long as it too is placed behind an interstitial). People on X can control what media they see and we recommend reviewing your media settings to ensure you either see or do not see this sensitive media, depending on your preferences.\n \u00c2\u00a0 Community Notes A critical topic during times of conflict is misleading information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something that every publisher and platform is tackling. We believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to add context to potentially misleading content, and that a community-led approach is an effective solution. This led us to creating Community Notes, which addresses a far wider range of sophisticated media types than our historical approaches. In the first month of the conflict, notes have been viewed well over a hundred million times, addressing topics from out-of-context videos to AI-generated media to claims about specific events. And when notes are added, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re effective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re helpful to people across the political spectrum, they measurably inform people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding and people choose to share potentially misleading content less (and often delete it). On average, people are 30% less likely to agree with the substance of the original post after reading a note about it. We hold a high bar for both the quality of notes posted and the speed and scale at which they appear. Here are some improvements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in just the past month: Notes are getting faster.\nThey are now visible 1.5 to 3.5 hrs more quickly than a month ago. Note previews directly on posts help contributors find and rate proposed notes faster.\n Notes are appearing on far more posts.\nWe have north of 200,000 contributors in 44 countries and are growing. That includes over 40,000 new contributors added from the beginning of the conflict.\nWe recently launched and have been enhancing notes on new media types. When a note is added to a photo or video, it automatically shows on other posts with matching media. Because of this new feature, notes related to the Israel-Hamas conflict have been displayed on 10,000+ posts.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis number grows automatically if the relevant images and video are re-used in new posts.\nAdditionally, we have launched an update making it easier to see the post on which any given note was originally written, enabling people to see the original context.\n Notes regularly appear on highly engaged content.\nThis helps to inform many people about a topic, and also allows people to become familiar with the ways in which content can be misleading, so they can better consume future information.\n We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re notifying more users after a Note has been added.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ramped up notifications to people who Like, Repost or Reply to a post that then later has a Community Note added to it. And during peaks of the ramp up, we were sending nearly 1000 notifications per second.\n We are updating our policies to prevent posts with Community Notes from being monetized. \u00c2\u00a0 Brand Safety\u00c2\u00a0 X has robust products and policies that we enforce 24/7 to provide brand safety for all advertisers. As part of this commitment, we do not monetize content that violates our policies. In response to the Israel-Hamas conflict we have proactively removed more than 100 publisher videos not suitable for monetization. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve updated our keyword blocklists with more than 1,000 terms related to the conflict, preventing ad targeting and adjacency on Timeline or Search placements. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented a change where Amplify Video campaigns from our content partners will only run in the Home Timeline. With many conversations happening on X right now, we have also shared guidance on how to manage brand activity during this moment through our suite of brand safety and suitability protections and through tighter targeting to suitable brand content like sports, music, business and gaming.  Our work is ongoing We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to engage with communities, governments, nonprofits, customers and others who have constructive feedback and ideas to strengthen our approach. Protecting the public conversation and the safety of the platform is our priority. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

X is now a place where everyone can freely express themselves, so long as they do so within the bounds of the law. We believe open and respectful discourse is the single best way for humanity to thrive.\nSafety. Safety on X remains a critical priority \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our work is not done, but we are making real progress. Our trust and safety team is working around the clock to combat bad actors and consistently enforce our rules in areas such as hate speech, platform manipulation, child safety, impersonation, civic integrity and more. We also remain committed to privacy and data protection.\nPartnerships. Our team also has ongoing dialogue with external groups to keep up to date with potential risks and support the safety of the platform \u00e2\u0080\u0093 partners like the Technology Coalition, Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee and Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.\nTime spent. Our fiercely loyal users are living more of their lives on X \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with 7.8B+ active minutes on X per day, driven by growth in our Video and Communities products. Today, the average user spends more than 32 minutes of their day on X.\nUser base. Over half a billion of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most informed and influential people come to X every month. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inclusive of our efforts to aggressively remove spam and inauthentic accounts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a step we believe is critical to improve the X user experience and grow the platform. We continue to see sign-ups average around 1.5 million per day.\nMisleading or inaccurate information. We have made real progress in our work to combat misinformation from all sides on X. Community Notes now has over 100K contributors in 44 countries and growing. This product is not perfect, but it is improving rapidly. Notes are being seen tens of millions of times per day, and they are getting much faster \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a necessity in a world where breaking information is inherently uncertain and X has outperformed traditional media.\nBrand safety and suitability. X advertisers now have a level of control that largely did not exist one year ago. Thanks to new products like Adjacency Controls, Sensitivity Settings and third party measurement partnerships with industry leaders Integral Ad Science and DoubleVerify, the average brand safety score on X is now >99%, and we are now seeing brand suitability scores at >97% when these controls are applied.\nAdvertiser momentum. Our willingness to listen and take action on brand safety has been recognized by the advertising community. Since mid-May, all major agencies have reversed their pause guidance against advertising on X. Last quarter alone over 1,700 advertisers returned to X, from small businesses to major brands \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including 90 of the top 100 ad spenders from a year ago. We are committed to making X the best place for businesses to launch new products, connect with culture and drive people to buy.\nFrom Twitter to X. We transformed Twitter into X, the everything app, where everyone is increasingly connected to everything they care about. This move enabled us to evolve past a legacy mindset and reimagine how users around the world consume, interact, watch and, soon, transact \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all in one seamless interface. We have become the modern global town square.\nProduct and infrastructure velocity. We shipped over 200 products and features post-acquisition with a significantly smaller team. How did we achieve this? We rebuilt and simplified large parts of the systems and infrastructure powering our main product surfaces from the ground up, which allowed us to maintain platform stability and innovate faster. We also invested in our machine learning capabilities with model architecture improvements and investments in on-prem GPU clusters to increase content relevance for our users.\nVerification and premium subscriptions. We have incentivized quality content while at the same time combating spam and bots. Today, the average X Premium subscriber spends three times longer on the platform than a non-subscriber. We have launched this offering in over 200 countries and territories worldwide, and created more utility and fun with new features like longer posts and videos, audio and video calls, bookmarks, edit posts, prioritized rankings and verification \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to name a few.\nVerified Organizations. X is leading the market in business verification \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our Verified Organizations subscription enables organizations to verify and create a network of on-platform affiliate handles, access all of our premium features and expand their organic reach. We have also rolled out the beta version of X Hiring, our very own recruitment platform.\nX Hiring. Through a Verified Organizations subscription, businesses can now post a job listing directly on the platform. Our engaged and educated audience makes for some of the most exceptional employees in the world. From software engineers, to healthcare professionals, to sales associates \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hundreds of companies are already finding their next hires on X.\nWelcoming the creator economy. You can now create, connect and collect all on X. We have enabled the economic success of creators via our relaunching of Creator Subscriptions and our ad revenue sharing program. So far, we have paid out more than $20 million to our creator community \u00e2\u0080\u0093 creators big and small are spurring our flywheel effect.\nBuilding communities. More people are getting together in X Communities, now available to all countries in English plus Japan. The conversations are public, discoverable and always lively. We see 70,000 people join a new Community each day, with time spent rising 300% since May.\nMessaging and calling. Direct messaging on X is a completely enhanced experience from a year ago. We rolled out encrypted messaging to X Premium subscribers, increased the limit on group DMs to 200 and added more message reply functionality. Just yesterday, we launched audio and video calling, enabling Premium subscribers to call any X handle in the world without having to give them their phone number.\nMake X yours. One of the most powerful things about X is how unique the experience can be to each and every one of us. From the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d tab to adding bookmarks to making Lists and Communities pinnable to the Home Timeline, we have introduced more personalization features to help make X yours. We also open-sourced our algorithm to increase transparency and invited our community to help us improve our recommendation algorithms. Any platform committed to transparency would do the same.\nLong form content. We added the ability for X Premium subscribers to post up to 2 hours of 1080p or 3 hours of 720p video content. In one month alone, people watched 210 years worth of videos 30 minutes or longer, with Sports, Business, Gaming, Politics and Entertainment topping the charts. Meanwhile, you can now write or read an essay by posting up to 25,000 rich-text characters and embed images within posts. Each day 150,000 new long form posts are published, receiving more than 3 billion impressions.\nVertical video. As video consumption on the platform grows, we have scaled the ability for users to watch a continuous loop of sound-on, vertical video. This surface already has over 100 million daily users \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more than half of which are Gen Z, the fastest growing segment on X. Soon, we will GA Vertical Video Ads to all advertisers globally with a pre-bid, vetted inventory solution via our brand safety partners Integral Ad Science.\nPremium content. X is now home to more than 750 of the industry's most premium content producers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from the sports leagues, to premium publishers, broadcast networks, and creators. We are poised to grow these partnerships further while bringing original programming to X for the first time in the platform's history, in concert with both creators and brands.\nEnhanced advertising solutions. We have expanded our powerful advertiser solutions. Our new Keyword Ads product enables advertisers to pay for proximity to highly relevant conversations. Amplify Video continues to connect advertisers to their audiences via the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most premium and brand safe publisher content. And Vertical Video Ads will soon enable full-screen, sound-on advertising within our fastest growing video surface.\nAPI partners.\u00c2\u00a0The public conversation on X is a unique and powerful data set. We have streamlined and consolidated our subscription offering to cater to developers of all sizes, while continuing to provide free support to public utilities such as MTA, NWS and many more. By focusing on the value of our unique data we are quickly growing and expanding our data licensing business.\nPayments. We want money on X to flow as freely as information and conversation. We have already secured first money transmitter licenses in several states, and we are moving toward launching a global payment system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 more soon!\nThis product innovation and business momentum stands on the shoulders of one of the most rigorous corporate restructurings in history. We are rebuilding our team and leadership to reflect the evolving needs of our customers and partners.\nAnd if we can achieve all of this in just 12 months, just imagine the scope of our ambition for next year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from expanded search to newswires to payments, we are just getting started.\nTo our passionate and growing community and all of the teams, partners and customers who have been a part of this transformation, thank you.\nOne year in, the future of X is bright. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

People want real-time information from voices around the world, and they want accurate information. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s X\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambition to make this a reality.\nX has long had policies designed to safeguard this platform from bad actors, including teams that address coordinated accounts and similar problems. That remains true. In addition, we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to add context to potentially misleading content.\nA year ago, we widely launched a new approach to adding context \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a community-driven approach, designed to be helpful and informative to people across viewpoints: @CommunityNotes. We want to share what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed, and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on.\nIn this first year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and thanks to the incredible contributor community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen remarkable results:\nCommunity Notes now address a far wider range of topics than our historic approaches to addressing misleading information. In the past two weeks alone, notes have been seen well over 100 million times, addressing an enormous range of topics from out-of-context videos to AI-generated media, to claims about specific events and more. When notes are added, they are effective \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re helpful to people across the political spectrum, they measurably inform people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding, and they lead people to Like and Repost potentially misleading content less. Often, post authors even choose to delete their posts after a note is added.\nWe believe innovation in this space has been important for the world. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, and why we are so optimistic about a community-driven approach:\nTrust. A key challenge with traditional fact-checking driven by companies or institutions (and the resultant enforcement actions) is that it can be highly divisive. Significant portions of the public often dismiss such actions as biased. Community Notes was created to deliver context and information in a way that people would trust and feel to be fair \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we pursued it when we saw in research how positively people from different viewpoints respond to it. To build trust, Community Notes has two unique features that differentiate it from other approaches: (1) Bridging-based ranking. For a note to become visible to all users on X, it must be rated \u00e2\u0080\u009chelpful\u00e2\u0080\u009d by reviewers who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously disagreed. (2) Open source. The code and all of the data that power Community Notes are open-source, so anyone can audit, analyze, critique or help improve it.\nSpeed and scale. Traditional approaches also face challenges with speed and scale. It is challenging to cover the wide range of potentially misleading information out there, and it is common for context to take many hours or days to be added, particularly with new content and claims. We believe a community-led approach has the potential to scale much wider and respond more quickly, and we already see impressive results that continue to improve over time.\nConsistently helpful to people across political and ideological spectrums. Community Notes' ability to produce visible notes that are broadly found helpful is remarkable given the strong opinions and divisions around the topics on which notes appear. We believe this is key to its effectiveness. To improve this even further, we regularly launch updates to Community Notes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 open-source algorithm, like yesterday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s note scoring improvement, and to the core product experience, like last week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s change that made sources required.\nWe put a high priority on note quality, as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to trust and effectiveness. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been driving up speed and scale:\nNotes are fast and getting faster, and are now seen 1.5 to 3.5 hrs more quickly than a month ago. Notes in the first few days of the Israel-Hamas conflict appeared at a median time of about 5 hours after post creation. And that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include the tens of thousands of notes that appear in just minutes on posts that reuse an image or video that has already received a note. We know some people will inevitably see posts before a note appears, so we also send notifications to people who previously engaged with a post that later receives a note. We continue to improve speed with infrastructure improvements, like a recent change to a real-time streaming architecture, and experience improvements, like note previews that help gather ratings on notes quickly.\nNotes are appearing on far more posts, powered by media matching and our expansion to well over 100K contributors in 44 countries and growing. We recently launched and have been enhancing \u00e2\u0080\u009cnotes on media,\u00e2\u0080\u009d meaning that when a note is added to a photo or video, it automatically shows on other posts with matching media. In some cases, individual notes match hundreds or thousands of posts.\u00c2\u00a0\nNotes often appear on viral and high-visibility content. This has the benefit of helping to inform a large number of people about a topic, and also allows people to become familiar with the ways in which content can be misleading, so they can better consume future information. \nFinally, we listen closely to feedback on how Community Notes can improve. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shipped more than one product update every week on average throughout 2023, and in the last two weeks alone, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shipped eight. These improvements are often based on feedback from the public and contributors, and improve things like note quality, speed and experience. Community Notes regularly get better on a weekly basis.\nWe are asked regularly how Community Notes prevent gaming and manipulation. We built Community Notes with the expectation that people would attempt to game it from day one, and designed it to deliver quality notes in the face of this. Notes takes multiple steps to achieve this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from account signup requirements, to writing ability and other capabilities needing to be earned through a track record of helpful contributions, and most importantly to the core algorithm that shows notes only when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re found helpful by people who disagree. In addition, the open-source code and data make it possible for others to help identify weaknesses or make improvements. We will continue to be vigilant to ensure note quality stays high.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard people suggest there should be a mechanism to address cases where an account frequently receives Community Notes on their posts. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re evaluating whether an option exists that people would find helpful and fair. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that Community Notes sometimes just add informative context to posts, and do not always reflect a post being misleading. We welcome feedback and suggestions on this topic.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard that people want notes to be faster and cover more posts. A community-driven approach can maximize quality, speed and scale, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always working to improve in those areas. Periodically, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been challenged on these dimensions, but those challenges often do not quantitatively compare the performance, quality, visibility and reach of Community Notes to other products, publishers and news organizations. Being open-sourced, we welcome feedback and critiques. And we believe that when it's done meaningfully and transparently, there can be a great deal of improvements to build better models to address misleading information globally.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a year in, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always on day one. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect perfection, but we have high ambitions for quality, speed and scale and helping people stay informed. As one person put it in an X post, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not perfect, but it IS working pretty [darn] well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With the help of our contributors, and feedback from the public, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to keep making it work even more darn well. The world needs it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to innovate, and continue to openly share the data \u00e2\u0080\u0094 along with the code \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to show our progress.\nWe couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this without our contributors and all the people who provide feedback.

We firmly believe these two values can coexist, and we work tirelessly to achieve that goal. \nAs part of this, we are committed to combating hatred, prejudice and intolerance \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly when they are directed at marginalized and persecuted groups. That means taking proportionate action on content that violates our Rules. And today we wanted to share the real progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making in combating antisemitism on X.\nOur longstanding policies cover a wide range of behavior that targets an individual or group of people with abuse based on their perceived or real membership in any protected category.\nEarlier this year we expanded our Violent & Hateful Entities policy, refreshed our policies around Violent Speech to reflect our zero tolerance approach and updated our Abusive Behavior policy to more clearly prohibit targeted harassment.\nOn an ongoing basis, we add new slurs, harmful terms and phrases to our operational handbook and proactive heuristics to ensure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re capturing the evolving landscape and use of language to target members of protected categories, including members of the Jewish community.\nWe continuously improve our automated enforcement to more quickly identify and remediate instances of hateful conduct (including antisemitic conduct) on the platform by expanding the application of our machine learning models.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe actively provide ongoing training support and mandatory refresher requirements for our frontline moderators to educate them about different types of antisemitic hate speech and how they may manifest on X.\u00c2\u00a0\n Through our policies and enforcement, active training of agents, and working alongside our partners and users, X is committed to combating antisemitism on our platform.

During elections, our Civic Integrity Policy provides an extra layer of protection that is applied for a limited period of time before and during an election.

We will add publicly visible labels to posts identified as potentially violating the Civic Integrity Policy, letting people know when their reach has been restricted.\nBuilding on our commitment to free expression, we are also going to allow political advertising. Starting in the U.S., we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to apply specific policies to paid-for promoted political posts. This will include prohibiting the promotion of false or misleading content, including false or misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an election, while seeking to preserve free and open political discourse. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also provide a global advertising transparency center so that everyone can review political posts being promoted on X, in addition to robust screening processes to ensure only eligible groups and campaigns are able to advertise.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nOur product: We continue to scale Community Notes, an innovative tool that empowers a vetted and growing group of people to add context to posts when they see something that could be wrong, misleading or requires another point of view. X shouldn't determine the truthfulness of disputed information; rather, we should empower our users to express their opinions and openly debate during elections, in line with our commitment to protecting freedom of expression.\nCommunity Notes is available globally with contributors in 44 countries, and is fully open-sourced. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing real impact\u00e2\u0080\u0094people are on average 30% less likely to agree with the substance of a post after reading a Community Note about it, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also less likely to reshare it.

We believe people of all backgrounds and beliefs should have the right to freely express themselves, so long as they do so within the bounds of the law.\u00c2\u00a0\nFree expression is fundamental to a healthy functioning global society \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s taken away, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost impossible to get back. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we will continue to stand up for people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights, including over half a billion passionate users who turn to our platform continually.\u00c2\u00a0\nFree expression and platform safety are not at odds. We are proving this every day through innovative enforcement policies that have helped reduce hateful content viewed on the platform. Today, more than 99.99% of post impressions are healthy.\nDespite our continued progress, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and its backers have been actively working to assert false and misleading claims encouraging advertisers to pause investment on the platform. X is a free public service funded largely by advertisers.\nThrough the CCDH's scare campaign and its ongoing pressure on brands to prevent the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to free expression, the CCDH is actively working to prevent public dialogue. Recently Brandwatch made X aware that the CCDH gained access to X's data without Brandwatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authorization, and that the purported CCDH \"research\" cited in a Bloomberg article \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontained metrics used out of context to make unsubstantiated assertions about X (formerly Twitter).\u00e2\u0080\u009d The CCDH gained this access with the cooperation of the European Climate Foundation, which provided credentials to CCDH in violation of their contractual obligations to Brandwatch. Additionally, the CCDH has recently scraped X's platform, which is a violation of our terms of service.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why X has filed a legal claim against the CCDH its backers, and the European Climate Foundation. X not only rejects all claims made by the CCDH, but, through our own investigation, we have identified several ways in which the CCDH is actively working to prevent free expression. That includes:\nTargeting people on all platforms who speak about issues the CCDH doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with.\nAttempting to coerce the deplatforming of users whose views do not conform to the CCDH's ideological agenda.\nTargeting free-speech organizations by focusing on their revenue stream to remove free services for people.\u00c2\u00a0\nAttempting to illegally gain unauthorized access to social media platform data and to misuse that data.\nWe have a big responsibility to protect free expression. And we will continue to cooperate with all partners who want to both preserve people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to freely express themselves, and equally work to create a safe and healthy space for everyone. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Everyday, we work to preserve free speech on X, while equally maintaining the health of our platform. Since the launch of Freedom of Speech Not Reach, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen encouraging results. That's why in the coming weeks, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding the application of this enforcement action from our Hateful Conduct policy to now include our policies on Abusive Behavior and Violent Speech.\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, more than 99.99% of post impressions are from healthy content, or content that does not violate our rules. For the small minority of content that is violative, we apply proportionally appropriate enforcement action. We will continue to remove the most serious violations of our rules, such as illegal content, and suspend bad actors from our platform.\u00c2\u00a0\nMore than any other platform, X's enforcement approach brings a new level of transparency to restricting the reach of posts identified as potentially violating our policies by making the content less discoverable.\nThe X community has also provided valuable feedback to help us make meaningful changes to the accuracy of our label application, such as identifying instances where reach was not appropriately restricted and improving recognition of context in our detection.\nHere is some of the impact since we launched this new enforcement philosophy:\nLabels have been applied to more than 700,000 violative posts that fall under our Hateful Conduct policy. We also proactively prevent ads from appearing adjacent to content that we label.\nCompared to a healthy post, posts with these labels\u00e2\u0080\u0094or restricted posts\u00e2\u0080\u0094 receive 81% less reach or impressions\u00c2\u00a0and we proactively prevent ads from appearing adjacent to content that we label.\nMore than one third of authors proactively choose to delete the post after they are informed that its reach has been restricted. \nOn average, only 4 percent of authors have appealed labels.\n90 percent of all appeals receive a response within 30 minutes.\nWhile this progress is promising, our work is ongoing. And as part of our commitment to transparency and results, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to provide periodic updates on our progress.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nFleets: a new way to join the conversation\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 November 2020\n          \nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nTransparency around image cropping and changes to come \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 1 October 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          "}

We believe Twitter users have the right to express their opinions and ideas without fear of censorship. We also believe it is our responsibility to keep users on our platform safe from content violating our Rules.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese beliefs are the foundation of Freedom of Speech, not Freedom of Reach - our enforcement philosophy which means, where appropriate, restricting the reach of Tweets that violate our policies by making the content less discoverable.\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share an update on our approach to policy enforcement that better aligns this philosophy with our commitment to transparency.\u00c2\u00a0\nRestricting the reach of Tweets, also known as visibility filtering, is one of our existing enforcement actions that allows us to move beyond the binary \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave up versus take down\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach to content moderation.

Starting soon, we will add publicly visible labels to Tweets identified as potentially violating our policies letting you know we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve limited their visibility. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Author Label\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \n          \n            Viewer Label\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \n          \n            Viewer Label\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nThese labels bring a new level of transparency to enforcement actions by displaying which policy the Tweet potentially violates to both the Tweet author and other users on Twitter. Tweets with these labels will be made less discoverable on the platform. Additionally, we will not place ads adjacent to content that we label. You can learn more about the ways we may restrict a Tweet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach here.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nAuthors will be able to submit feedback on the label if they think we incorrectly limited their Tweet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visibility. Currently, submitting feedback does not guarantee you will receive a response or that your Tweet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach will be restored. We are working on allowing authors to appeal our decision.\nWhile these labels will initially only apply to a set of Tweets that potentially violate our Hateful Conduct policy, we plan to expand their application to other applicable policy areas in the coming months. This change is designed to result in enforcement actions that are more proportional and transparent for everyone on our platform. What remains unchanged is our commitment to keeping Twitter a safe place for conversation. We will continue to remove illegal content and suspend bad actors from our platform.

So today we are taking the first step in a new era of transparency and opening much of our source code to the global community.\nOn GitHub, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find two new repositories (main repo, ml repo) containing the source code for many parts of Twitter, including our recommendations algorithm, which controls the Tweets you see on the For You timeline. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also sharing more information on our recommendation algorithm in this post on our Engineering Blog. For this release, we aimed for the highest possible degree of transparency, while excluding any code that would compromise user safety and privacy or the ability to protect our platform from bad actors, including undermining our efforts at combating child sexual exploitation and manipulation. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release also does not include the code that powers our ad recommendations.\nWe also took additional steps to ensure that user safety and privacy would be protected, including our decision not to release training data or model weights associated with the Twitter algorithm at this point.\nUltimately, this is our first step to be more transparent in this way, and we plan to continue sharing more code that does not present a significant risk to Twitter or people on our platform.\nWe invite the community to submit GitHub issues and pull requests for suggestions on improving the recommendations algorithm. We are working on tools to manage these suggestions and sync changes to our internal repository. Any security concerns or issues should be routed to our official bug bounty program through HackerOne. We hope to benefit from the collective intelligence and expertise of the global community in helping us identify issues and suggest improvements, ultimately leading to a better Twitter.\nAs the town square of the internet, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ultimately doing this to foster transparency and build trust with our users, customers, and the general public. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to share updates as we make progress in this area.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Instead of only entering a password to log in, 2FA requires you to also enter a code or use a security key. This additional step helps make sure that you, and only you, can access your account. To date, we have offered three methods of 2FA: text message, authentication app, and security key.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile historically a popular form of 2FA, unfortunately we have seen phone-number based 2FA be used - and abused - by bad actors. So starting today, we will no longer allow accounts to enroll in the text message/SMS method of 2FA unless they are Twitter Blue subscribers. The availability of text message 2FA for Twitter Blue may vary by country and carrier.\nNon-Twitter Blue subscribers that are already enrolled will have 30 days to disable this method and enroll in another. After 20 March 2023, we will no longer permit non-Twitter Blue subscribers to use text messages as a 2FA method. At that time, accounts with text message 2FA still enabled will have it disabled. Disabling text message 2FA does not automatically disassociate your phone number from your Twitter account. If you would like to do so, instructions to update your account phone number are available on our Help Center.\nWe encourage non-Twitter Blue subscribers to consider using an authentication app or security key method instead. These methods require you to have physical possession of the authentication method and are a great way to ensure your account is secure.

Subscribers who change their profile information, including display name, profile photo, and username (@handle), will temporarily lose their blue checkmark until those changes are reviewed by Twitter.

We believe that a service of this importance will benefit from feedback at scale, and that there is value in being open about our experiments and what we are learning. We do all of this work with one goal in mind: to improve Twitter for our customers, partners, and the people who use it across the world.\nAs we carry out this work, we want to assure you of a few things:\u00c2\u00a0\nFirst, none of our policies have changed. Our approach to policy enforcement will rely more heavily on de-amplification of violative content: freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.\nOur Trust & Safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules. The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse.\nWhen urgent events manifest on the platform, we ensure that all content moderators have the guidance they need to find and address violative content.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs we improve our policies and processes, bad actors will also develop new methods of disruption. This is not new. Our team of experts is constantly adapting to identify and defuse threats, and we are proud of our early results: impressions on violative content are down over the past month, despite the growth in overall usage on the platform.\nFinally, as we embark on this new journey, we will make mistakes, we will learn, and we will also get things right. Throughout, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll communicate openly with our users and customers, to get and share your feedback as we build.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe remain committed to providing a safe, inclusive, entertaining, and informative experience for everyone. We will continue to be transparent as we move through this transition period. And we will listen to you, the people who make Twitter what it is: the town square of the internet.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Twitter Team\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

This collaboration, which began as a pilot in 2021, helps our Curation Team add context to the wide range of Portuguese-language topics and conversations happening on Twitter.\nNow we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding the scope of our work with AFP to include Spanish-language content curation in LATAM, Spain, and the US.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith the help of AFP, our Curation Team is now able to better scale and provide informative context on timely topics being discussed on Twitter in Spanish. We can also detect topics that are generating widespread interest in a more proactive way, including those that could potentially generate misleading information.\nHow and where does AFP curated content appear?\nJust like our content curated by other trusted news agencies such as Reuters and The Associated Press, the content curated by AFP teams Latin America (AFP Factual for Spanish and AFP Checamos for Portuguese) is visible in the form of Moments that appear in various places throughout Twitter. These include: \nTrends\nExplore tab\nSearch\nPrompts\nTweet labels\nAnother way we address misinformation via our Curation program is by publishing \u00e2\u0080\u009cdebunks\u00e2\u0080\u009d relevant to the main misleading narratives circulating on Twitter. According to internal data, more than 9 million people per day come across at least one of these debunks while navigating our service.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou may also see the information in Tweets posted by AFP or our other trusted curation partners.\nAdding helpful context to Twitter\nOur goal is to help people on Twitter easily access credible, contextualized information and make informed decisions about the content they choose to engage with. The expanded collaboration with AFP is the latest in a series of ongoing efforts to help bring us closer to that goal. \nEarlier this month, we announced that the visibility of Birdwatch notes was expanding to everyone in the US. These notes are written and selected by people on Twitter, for people on Twitter, to add helpful context to Tweets in a transparent and collaborative way. Alongside AP and Reuters, AFP will help us evaluate Birdwatch notes in the US to understand how the service is performing.\nKeep your eyes here or follow @Birdwatch for more updates.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npartnerships\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          \nNew conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 August 2020\n          \nNew labels for government and state-affiliated media accounts\n            \n            \n             Thursday, 6 August 2020\n          "}

Guided by their input, we got to work with the audio experts at Listen creating a growing collection of new Twitter sounds designed to meet the following criteria:\nPromoting accessibility for those with sensory sensitivities\nBlending the organic and digital\nKeeping sounds short and smooth\nAttracting attention without being distracting\nYou can check some of them out for yourself below.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nMore sounds, and where to hear them\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to say that the first batch of new sounds for timeline refreshes and Twitter Spaces are now available globally on iOS and Android devices.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve quite literally grown up together \u00e2\u0080\u0094 her self-titled debut album was released in 2006, the same year Twitter was created. \nSince 2010, Taylor Swift has been mentioned in 329 million Tweets. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an average of more than 75,114 Tweets every day for the past, oh, 4,380 days. In fact, when\u00c2\u00a0Red (Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Version)\u00c2\u00a0was released in November 2021, there were more Tweets about Taylor Swift than about football and basketball combined.\n\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b3\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b3\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b3\nSwifties are loud and proud on Twitter, too. The word \u00e2\u0080\u009cSwiftie\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cSwifties\u00e2\u0080\u009d has been Tweeted more than 18 million times over the past 12 years, usually accompanied by emojis like the red scarf (\u00f0\u009f\u00a7\u00a3) which saw a 25x increase in use on the day\u00c2\u00a0All Too Well (Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Version)\u00c2\u00a0was released.\u00c2\u00a0\nSpeaking of\u00c2\u00a0All Too Well (Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Version), since 2019 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most Tweeted about Taylor Swift song alongside\u00c2\u00a0Love Story (Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Version)\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Wildest Dreams (Taylor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Version).\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSwifties' response to Midnights\nThe response to Midnights from fans on Twitter has been, well, swift.\u00c2\u00a0\nSince the album's release, there have been about 5 million Tweets about it, and nearly 4 million of those were published by the end of October 22. To put that in some perspective, Taylor Swift generated 2x more Tweet volume than NFL football on Thursday, October 20!\nFans can't get enough of three songs in particular: Anti-Hero, Lavender Haze, and Snow on the Beach, which make up the Top 3 most Tweeted-about songs since the release of Midnights. And there's lots of love to go around for Taylor's collaborators, as well. Mentions of Jack Antonoff, for example, grew 14x compared to the day before the album release!\nMusic: The largest community on Twitter \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true: music is the largest community on Twitter. With 441 million unique followers, people are more likely to follow a music-related account than any other type of account on Twitter. \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise, then, that major music releases tend to be top events on Twitter.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how\n            By\n            \n  \n  \nThursday, 13 October 2022\nLink copied successfully\nOver the years, Twitter has become a critical communication tool for responding to natural disasters.\nOur teams have a longstanding commitment to working alongside global partners and developers to share important information, provide real-time updates, facilitate relief efforts, and much more. We also take steps to address misleading information that can surface during these crises.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo help ensure our service remains a resource for as many people as possible, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put together a snapshot of some of the ways Twitter can be used to help during natural disasters.\nSupporting preparedness and increasing awareness\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to raise awareness about natural disasters before they happen. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Twitter regularly collaborates with organizations to keep people informed about and prepared for extreme weather and other potential emergencies. \nIn September, for example, Twitter Australia partnered with the Australian Red Cross on a Timeline and Trend Takeover campaign designed to help people prepare for weather-related emergencies. The #EmergencyReady campaign was viewed nearly 5 million times in 24 hours.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBeing prepared for disasters means no one is left behind or overlooked. Twitter Australia generously provided national visibility of key safety messages about disaster preparedness, at a critical time of year for all Australians.\nAndrew Coghlan\nHead of Emergency Services, Australian Red Cross\nTwitter partners frequently with crisis response organizations\u00c2\u00a0 all over the world to help enhance the capacity of those communicating with populations affected by natural disasters.\nSharing information and best practices\nWhen it comes to staying safe during natural disasters, Twitter can be a powerful resource for sharing critical information. \nIn the wake of the 2017 Puebla earthquake in Mexico, for example, we collaborated with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to put together a shareable list of best practices for communicating on Twitter during times of crisis. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSimilarly in 2021, as Japan approached the 10-year anniversary of the T\u00c5\u008dhoku earthquake and tsunami, our team shared a set of illustrations with important information about how best to communicate on Twitter in an emergency situation.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis year we went further, organizing Twitter Spaces events with local Japanese media and other social media platforms to discuss reporting strategies for disaster prevention and readiness. We also created a custom origami crane emoji and hashtags to encourage participation in critical conversations around the subject.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAmplifying credible information using search prompts\nWhen people search for keywords on Twitter related to active emergency situations, we work to ensure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re met with authoritative and credible information first.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSearch prompts are one important way we do this. When heavy flooding occurred in Pakistan beginning in June 2022, Twitter launched a #ThereIsHelp prompt to redirect our Pakistani audience to an emergency helpline at the Pakistani Red Crescent Society. Similarly, during this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Taal Volcano eruption in the Philippines and Typhoon Noru in Southeast Asia, search prompts were created to help quickly deliver credible information to people on Twitter impacted by these extreme weather events.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOrganizing credible information in a centralized place\nDuring natural disasters, Twitter has tools such as Moments and Lists that can be used to create a centralized source of credible information.\u00c2\u00a0 \nIn anticipation of 2022\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hurricane Ian in the United States, for example, a Twitter Moment was created to elevate public service information as well as amplify announcements from local law enforcement and emergency services. Moments can also be used to address and correct misleading information, like when comments on hurricane preparedness made by the US president in August 2021 were mistakenly attributed to Hurricane Ian.\nIn addition to Moments, Twitter Lists can be used to collect and quickly share information about natural disasters and emergency services. In Japan, for example, a dedicated TwitterLifeline List has been created highlighting the Twitter accounts of prefectures, crisis organizations, and public transportation services. Twitter M\u00c3\u00a9xico recently published a list highlighting earthquake-related Tweets in real time.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEnabling partner initiatives and developer-built tools\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long history of individuals and organizations finding innovative ways to harness the power of Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \nFor example, in India, partners in the medical industry came together to create @BloodDonorsIndia which amplifies the blood donation requests of individual patients dealing with a range of health problems. The account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 1.2 million followers are able to reach potential donors that otherwise would have gone unreached, resulting in eight lives a day being saved through its efforts according to its own reporting.\nIn another example, developers in California used our API to create an automated Twitter account that has been documenting earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay area since 2009.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter also builds data partnerships to better understand the conversations happening on the platform. Most recently, we analyzed four extreme weather events to better determine patterns of those affected by natural disasters and build predictions for future events.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continually working to improve the ways we help communities prepare for and communicate during emergencies. Keep your eyes on @Twitter for the latest updates.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe main reason I like [Twitter] as a source of data is that it integrates not just a measure of typical exposure \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is \u00e2\u0080\u0098Did the water come onto the land in a place where it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t supposed to be? [It also] measures \u00e2\u0080\u0098What are people noticing? What are people talking about?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Twitter can give us this aggregated measure of what those social consequences of that particular flood are.\nDr. Frances Moore\nAssistant Professor in the Department of Environmental Science and Policy at University of California, Davis\nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsafety\ncrisis response\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

The wins, the learning moments, and the opportunities still to come. Despite the hurdles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and there have been plenty \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a company or group of employees more committed to this work. One of the things that makes this place so special is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s made up of individuals who show up each day with one powerful thing in common: the belief that we get to do great things with great people. We care deeply \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 about Twitter, and about each other. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what fuels the work, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what drives us toward becoming the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible tech company. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never changing.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn fact, we remain more committed than ever. This quarter was a testament. As progress towards our diversity goals slows, it can be dispiriting. But not at Twitter. We recognize that this work isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a moment in time; it's a continuous, conscious effort that requires us to be unwavering toward our goal. Come what may, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re firm in where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going. Sometimes, that just means being flexible with our route. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSo we flexed. We doubled down in areas that drive inclusion and where we knew we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have immediate impact for our Tweeps. We built a framework for belonging, zoomed in on our equity work, and supercharged our accessibility efforts. And today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to share more about our accessibility journey. Ultimately, accessibility is what empowers everyone to use their unique strengths and knowledge to do their best work, and its cornerstone in building the Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both the product and the workplace \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we love.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nForming our Accessibility Center of Excellence\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe recognized early on that having a centralized source of expertise was vital in moving towards a fully accessible Twitter. In February 2021, we established our Accessibility Center of Excellence (COE) with Gurpreet Kaur, Head of Global Accessibility, at its helm. The Accessibility COE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impact was immediate and widespread; working with partners across the business, they set clear goals, developed policies, and worked to improve the way people experience Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in real life as Tweeps and on our service. Early wins included launch of new standards for accessible meetings and events, introduction of an internal accessibility hub to share best practices and resources with Tweeps eager to lean in, and a new process to evaluate accessibility for third party suppliers.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn 2022, we formally made accessibility part of our Inclusion & Diversity team, expanding our scope \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the opportunity for impact. From product development to marketing and communication strategies, to legal and people standards, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made significant strides and are excited by the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve accomplished so far. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only just begun to scratch the surface and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much more to do.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nImproving the way we work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a Global Accessibility Policy\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis work is global. Solving for the needs of Tweeps and the people who use our service anywhere and everywhere is how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make Twitter truly accessible. With this in mind, our accessibility team kicked off work on a new Global Accessibility Policy in the first half of the year, designed to support our IDEA goals and improve our company in a way that hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been done before.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe Global Accessibility Policy serves as a framework to ensure that we consistently participate in, influence, and deliver accessible experiences and products to everyone around the world. It will ensure that any net-new product and internal tool launches or purchases prioritize accessibility for Tweeps or customers with disabilities. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAt Twitter:\u00c2\u00a0The policy facilitates accessible and inclusive working experiences for all Tweeps with disabilities.

This year, our Accessibility COE piloted the policy with three key organizations: Information Technology & Core Applications (IT), People & People Systems, and Procurement. Additionally, work on a Product policy is currently underway. Taking our Global Policy further, these org-specific policies are tailored for application and relevance:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIT & Core Tech: Establish tools and processes to support accessible development, including design systems, manual testing, and automated testing. \nPeople: Ensure that working experiences (from home, from office, or both) are built so that they are inclusive to people with disabilities. Tweep experiences (benefits, compensation, recruitment) are inclusive to people with disabilities. \nProcurement: Ensure that all net-new purchases of software that impacts all Tweeps and/or Customers are accessible to people with disabilities. \nProduct: Integrate accessibility best practices into every phase of the product development process and meet the latest published version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also proud to support Procure Access, a global cross-industry effort to grow the number of companies with accessible procurement programs.

No individual or team can carry us forward alone, and we know that our new Accessibility Policy will be most successful when supported by the understanding of both the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009chow\u00e2\u0080\u009d behind accessibility and disability inclusion at Twitter. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe built three foundational accessibility courses for Tweeps, pulling in best practices and the latest research from our partners at Disability:IN and Business Disability Forum. This is intentionally \u00e2\u0080\u009c101\u00e2\u0080\u009d content to help broaden and expand awareness and understanding.

Accessibility is about removing barriers so everyone has fair and equal access. Take this course to broaden your perspective and understanding of the different ways and adaptations people may make for accessibility.\nDisability Awareness: There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no guidebook that tells us how to interact with people who have disabilities. But, this course is for anyone\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 with or without a disability\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 who wants to learn basics on how to connect more effectively with people who have disabilities. So, come with us on this journey to explore how to be more aware, more empathetic, and more inclusive.\nPositive Communication: Get a 101 on positive language, which is crucial in inclusive communication. Plus, hear first-hand experiences from Tweeps who have disabilities. Let's continue our journey to be more intentional and build an accessible foundation for all.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAnd because we believe in sharing, these courses have been added to our #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit, available to everyone outside of Twitter too.

When we build for disability inclusion, we build for us all. The Accessibility Experience team works with the engineering, product, design, and research teams for Twitter.com and our mobile application development. They ship accessibility features while providing internal training.

Take our public ALT (alternative text) badge and exposed image descriptions, for example. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve incorporated feedback and globally launched this feature to support people who are blind, have low vision, use assistive technology, live in low-bandwidth areas, or simply want more context. In September, we also launched the ALT text image description reminder so that everyone can take part. You can read more here in our how to write great image descriptions guide. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our mission to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly without barriers, including people with disabilities/Disabled people.

Building the Twitter we all love takes a collective effort because inclusion, equity, diversity, and accessibility don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in vacuums. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this work in private or in silos. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, when we started our accessibility work, we created avenues for all Tweeps to lean in \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and learn.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAlong with our progress, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to share that Twitter was recognized as one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBest Places to Work for Disability Inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the second year in a row, receiving a top score on the Disability Equality Index. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPeople come to work at Twitter because they care.

Most notes contain additional sources that can be clicked for an even deeper dive into a subject or conversation.\nYou'll also have the ability to rate the notes you see to help us understand if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re helpful or not.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nKeeping Birdwatch notes helpful for everyone\nBirdwatch is made up of independent contributors, and individual notes are never written by Twitter, Inc. This is intentional, as it helps ensure our efforts to address potentially misleading information are informed by a diverse group of people who use our service. \nThe program is designed to surface notes that are informative and helpful to as many people as possible thanks in large part to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s known as a bridging algorithm. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works:\u00c2\u00a0\nIn order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives. Check out our Birdwatch guide for more info on this.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn many online spaces, especially those using engagement-based ranking, divisive content can be more likely to go viral. Bridging-based ranking systems aim to overcome this 'bias toward division'. Birdwatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of bridging to elevate context found helpful by people that tend to disagree is an exciting step toward a better internet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that supports those building common ground.\nAviv Ovadya\nTechnology and Public Purpose Fellow,  Belfer Center at Harvard Kennedy School (2021-2022)\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@metaviv\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nAdditionally, to keep the quality of notes high and encourage contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way, we developed a\u00c2\u00a0Birdwatch onboarding process\u00c2\u00a0through which new contributors earn the ability to write notes by consistently rating other contributors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful.\u00c2\u00a0\nExpanding Birdwatch based on positive results\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re opting to expand the visibility of Birdwatch notes to everyone in the US based on research that indicates the program is helpful and informative to people who hold different points of view. \nAccording to the results of four surveys run at different times between August, 2021 and August, 2022, a person who sees a Birdwatch note is, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. Survey participation ranged from 3,000 to more than 19,000 participants, and the results were consistent throughout the course of the year, even as news and Tweet topics changed.\nWe also see that Birdwatch informs sharing behavior. Analyzing our internal data, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that a person on Twitter who sees a note is, on average, 15-35% less likely to choose to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone.\nIn our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID.\u00c2\u00a0\nAn open and transparent process\nWe believe that earning trust starts with transparency. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the Birdwatch algorithm\u00c2\u00a0publicly available on GitHub, along with all the data that powers it, so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements. Whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a researcher, a hobbyist, or simply curious, you can explore and run the Birdwatch algorithm on your own computer using the guide link shared above.\u00c2\u00a0 \nYou can also keep up to date with all things Birdwatch by following our official\u00c2\u00a0@Birdwatch\u00c2\u00a0Twitter account, or\u00c2\u00a0click this link\u00c2\u00a0to apply to become a Birdwatch contributor and help improve the health of conversations on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          \nNew conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 August 2020\n          \nNew labels for government and state-affiliated media accounts\n            \n            \n             Thursday, 6 August 2020\n          "}

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an additional layer of protection whose purpose is to ensure that the public debate taking place on Twitter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t harm people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right or ability to vote. This extra policy is applied for a limited period of time before, during, and after an election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an interval determined by consulting with civic integrity experts. \nWith the Civic Integrity Policy in place in Brazil, Twitter will take measures in relation to content:\nIntended to intimidate people from participating in civic acts or to mislead them about how to take part in them\nThat makes any false or misleading statements undermining public confidence in the election\nThat intentionally indicates false or improper affiliation, own or of third parties, to candidates, parties and other institutions\nDepending on the severity of the violation, corrective measures may include tagging or removing the Tweet or even suspending the account.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that this policy does not cover all types of political content. Its focus is on misleading information that may harm the progress, popular participation, and/or outcome of a democratic electoral process.\nKeeping people informed\nTo help people find answers to their most common questions about the elections, we teamed up with Politize!, a civil society organization focused on political education. Anyone who sends a Direct Message (DM) to @Politize! will receive information that helps answer questions about the 2022 elections, politics in general, tips on how to spot fake news and have healthy conversations, and suggestions for reliable data sources. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also partnered with Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) to create a series of search prompts that appear as the first result of Twitter searches related to the election, among other initiatives.

The topic was Tweeted about more than 56 million times in the first eight months of 2022 alone.\u00c2\u00a0 \nTo help encourage people to engage in the conversation, Twitter has introduced a series of unique emojis around the elections in Brazil. These emojis appear whenever popular hashtags such as #Ele\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00b5es2022, #VoteConsciente, and #ProjetoElei\u00c3\u00a7\u00c3\u00a3o are used.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be adding in additional hashtag-prompted emojis around specific events such as debates and on election day itself.\u00c2\u00a0\nBeyond the elections: Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership with AFP\nHealthy conversations are informed by reliable information.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Twitter has been partnering with AFP, a leading global news agency, to help elevate credible news and information in Portuguese.

Then, earlier this year, we launched the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a global group of experts studying platform governance issues.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese combined efforts have given tens of thousands of researchers access to 52 datasets spanning nine terabytes of media and more than 220 million Tweets, all with one goal in mind: empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.\nNow we want to take it a step further. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, starting today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering researchers the opportunity to apply for membership in the TMRC.\nHow to apply for the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium\nMembership in the TMRC is open to global researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism. Our goal is simple: prioritize transparency by sharing more data on more issues to those who are studying content moderation.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe developed our application process in consultation with members of our Trust & Safety Council and other global experts. You can learn more about the Consortium here or review eligibility criteria and apply for membership here.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhy is transparency such a priority at Twitter?\nOver the years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned and shared a lot about the importance of combating manipulation and interference in political conversations on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \nBy providing academics and researchers with access to specific, granular data (not just aggregated reports), we enable them to find insights and contextualize information in a way that increases the visibility of the reports themselves.\nFor example, earlier this year we shared data from about 15 information operations as a pilot for the TMRC. This data has already enabled critical, independent research by TMRC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partners at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Cazadores de Fake News, and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to share platform manipulation campaigns and information operations with the Consortium, in line with our platform manipulation and spam policy. This includes sharing data with TMRC researchers about the networks we remove and technical information about the presumptive country of origin of information operations. However, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said previously, we'll no longer share our own attribution information for these datasets.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges\u00c2\u00a0that come with disclosures of this kind.\u00c2\u00a0\nOver time, we intend to share similarly comprehensive datasets about other content moderation policy areas and enforcement decisions, such as data about Tweets labeled under our misinformation policies.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndata\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

Recommendations are one of the ways we do that.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen a Tweet you enjoyed from someone you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably seen a recommendation. Think of them as personalized suggestions that are shown to you based on actions you take on Twitter.\nRecommendations are designed to enrich your Twitter experience, and the more you know about them, the better they can be. In fact, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put together a whole Help Center article detailing what types of content we recommend, where recommendations appear, and how you can control them (definitely worth a read).\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pressed for time, however, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the tl;dr on recommendations and how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to improve them.\nHow and where Twitter recommends content\nThe content we recommend to you is informed by actions you take on Twitter, also known as signals. \nSignals can include things like interests you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve told us about, Topics you follow, Tweets you engage with, and even Tweets people in your network like. Based on these signals and more, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you content we think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be interested in.\u00c2\u00a0\nRecommendations can appear in your Home timeline, certain places within the Explore tab, and elsewhere on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMaintaining a high standard for recommendations\nBecause recommended content doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always come from people and accounts you follow, we work to surface conversations that are relevant, healthy, and authentic. \nOur recommendations team partners closely with our Health, Trust & Safety, and Machine Learning Ethics teams to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re recommending high-quality content. You can read more about our standards for recommendations in the Help Center article linked above.\u00c2\u00a0\nControlling your recommendations \nIn addition to improving the quality of our recommendations, we also provide tools to manage recommendations and clear ways to tell us when we do and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it right. This is an important part of enabling you to use Twitter on your own terms.\u00c2\u00a0 \nOne of these options is the \u00e2\u0080\u009csparkle icon\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u009c\u00a8 located at the top right corner of your Home timeline. This lets you toggle between seeing top \"For You\" Tweets, which include recommendations from accounts and Topics you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow, and \"Latest\" Tweets from only the accounts you do follow.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou can also give us feedback on recommendations you see on your Home timeline. For example, liking or Retweeting recommended content will send us a signal that you find it interesting. Selecting \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot interested in this Tweet/Topic\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the Tweet menu, on the other hand, will tell us you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to see less of that type of content.\nHow we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Improving recommendations \nFinding Tweets and accounts you like should feel effortless. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in improving the quality of recommendations across Twitter and continuing to explore ways to make them easier to understand and control.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis includes a new design with an \u00e2\u0080\u009cX\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Tweets making it simple to remove them from your Home timeline and share your feedback with us. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also testing new ways to clearly distinguish and switch between your \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d Home timeline view that includes recommendations and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLatest\u00e2\u0080\u009d view that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWith millions of people signing up for Twitter every day, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also testing new ways for people who are new to our service to tell us more about what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in. This way we can easily recommend content, accounts, and Topics you truly want to see.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue working to improve the way you discover timely and interesting content on Twitter, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep\u00c2\u00a0sharing our progress with you along the way.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          \nNew conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 August 2020\n          \nNew labels for government and state-affiliated media accounts\n            \n            \n             Thursday, 6 August 2020\n          "}

For those who are blind or have low vision, image descriptions are an important tool for clarifying and enriching their experience.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out a new image description reminder to encourage more people on Twitter to add helpful descriptions to the images they Tweet.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important.\nActivating Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new image description reminder\nWhenever you add a photo to a Tweet, you have the option to describe it using alt text, also known as a digital image description. Our new image description reminder is a feature that prompts you to make a good habit of adding alt text to every image you upload and share on Twitter. \nOnce enabled, the feature sends you a prompt on web and mobile reminding you to add alt text whenever you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re about to Tweet an image.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out our new image description reminder globally, and most people on Twitter have access to it already (those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t will have it very soon). To activate it, open the main menu and select:\nSettings and privacy > Accessibility, display, and languages > Accessibility > Receive image description reminder\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhy is it important to add image descriptions?\u00c2\u00a0\nAdding descriptions to an image helps create a more inclusive experience for everyone on Twitter. The descriptions are useful not only to people using screen readers, but to those in low-bandwidth areas, those with web phones, and anyone who wants to learn more about an image.\u00c2\u00a0 \nImage descriptions help describe the image to people who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to view it, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep the text focused: capture what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important, be succinct, and be objective. For example, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Tweeting a photo of your favorite beach, you can write:\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAn empty beach at sunset with red, orange, purple, and blue colors in a cloudless sky. Palm trees are visible in the foreground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nYou can read more about how to write great image descriptions.\nPhotos with descriptions appear with an ALT badge in the lower left corner, making it clear that additional descriptive text is available for the image. Similar to Tweet text translations, Twitter translates image descriptions to allow people from around the world to benefit from image descriptions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nImproving accessibility at Twitter\nOur new image description reminder is part of our continuing efforts to make the public conversation more accessible to everyone. Other work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done recently includes adding an ALT badge, a Closed Captions toggle button, and captions for audio conversations on Spaces and Voice Tweets. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis work is made possible by our Accessibility Experience Team that works within our product organization on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition to the Accessibility Experience Team, Twitter has also created an Accessibility Center for Excellence whose role it is to consult and partner with teams across the company to ensure that everything from our legal and policy standards to our marketing strategies and office spaces are more accessible.\nYou can learn more about how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making Twitter more accessible by following @TwitterA11y, or Tweet your first image using an image description.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\naccessibility\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          \nNew conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 August 2020\n          \nNew labels for government and state-affiliated media accounts\n            \n            \n             Thursday, 6 August 2020\n          "}

Only notes that are rated Helpful by a diverse group of contributors, or that \u00e2\u0080\u009cbridge\u00e2\u0080\u009d across groups of people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings, are made visible on Twitter. \nThe program began testing in 2021 and is regularly being updated and improved thanks to analysis from our research team and feedback from our academic advisory board and Birdwatch contributors. Now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out a new onboarding process and expanding the visibility of notes to increase the positive impact of Birdwatch and enable healthier Twitter conversations.\u00c2\u00a0 \nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new, along with some important new findings that highlight the impact Birdwatch is already having on Twitter.\nA better way to join and contribute to Birdwatch\nWe're rolling out an updated Birdwatch onboarding process that better incentivizes contributors to write and rate notes in a thoughtful way. \nNew Birdwatch contributors who have met the eligibility criteria* will begin with an initial Rating Impact score of zero, which they can increase by consistently rating other contributors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 notes and reliably identifying those that are Helpful and Not Helpful. Once a contributor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score has risen to five, they can start writing notes.\nContributors can further increase their Writing and Rating Impact scores by both writing Helpful notes and continuing to rate notes written by others. Repeatedly writing notes that reach a status of Not Helpful, however, will result in a decreasing score and could temporarily lock a contributor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s note writing ability.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n*Birdwatch contributors must have a verified phone number from a trusted US-based carrier, no recent Twitter Rules violations, and a minimum six months on Twitter.\nExpanding the Birdwatch contributor base and the visibility of notes\nWith the new onboarding process in place, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to begin expanding our contributor base.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start by adding larger groups of eligible applicants to the pilot on a more frequent basis. The process will be adjusted as needed as we closely monitor whether this change has any impact on either the quality or the frequency of contributions.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThe visibility of notes on public Tweets will also be increasing. In the coming weeks, more people using Twitter in the US will start to see notes on Tweets that Birdwatch contributors have collectively identified as Helpful. Importantly, this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start seeing notes on every Tweet, simply that a larger number of you will start seeing notes that have been rated Helpful.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nUnderstanding the impact of Birdwatch\nOur research indicates that Birdwatch is an effective way to keep people better informed on Twitter. \nAccording to the results of three surveys, people who see a Birdwatch note are, on average, 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. By analyzing our internal data, we also estimate that people on Twitter who see notes are, on average, 15-35% less likely to Like or Retweet a Tweet than someone who sees the Tweet alone. \nNotes are intentionally designed to be as informative and helpful as possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 no matter who sees them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 thanks in large part to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbridging algorithm\u00e2\u0080\u009d we mentioned above. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works:\u00c2\u00a0 \nIn order to be shown on a Tweet, Birdwatch notes need to be found helpful by people who have tended to disagree in their past ratings. This means the algorithm takes into account not only how many contributors rated a note as Helpful or Not Helpful, but also whether people who rated it seem to come from different perspectives.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis approach appears to be having an impact. In our most recent survey, notes were found to be informative regardless of a person's self-identified political party affiliation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there was no statistically significant difference in average informativeness across party ID. The algorithm and all data it uses are publicly available on GitHub so anyone can audit, analyze, or suggest improvements.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in joining Birdwatch and contributing to a healthier, more well-informed Twitter conversation, click this link to get started.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          \nNew conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 August 2020\n          \nNew labels for government and state-affiliated media accounts\n            \n            \n             Thursday, 6 August 2020\n          "}

Great question. Edit Tweet is a feature that lets people make changes to their Tweet after it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been published. Think of it as a short period of time to do things like fix typos, add missed tags, and more. \nFor this test, Tweets will be able to be edited a few times in the 30 minutes following their publication. Edited Tweets will appear with an icon, timestamp, and label so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear to readers that the original Tweet has been modified. Tapping the label will take viewers to the Tweet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Edit History, which includes past versions of the Tweet. \nFor context, the time limit and version history play an important role here. They help protect the integrity of the conversation and create a publicly accessible record of what was said. \nWho will be testing Edit Tweet? \nLike any new feature, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re intentionally testing Edit Tweet with a smaller group to help us incorporate feedback while identifying and resolving potential issues. This includes how people might misuse the feature. You can never be too careful. \nLater this month, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be expanding Edit Tweet access to Twitter Blue subscribers. As part of their subscription, Twitter Blue subscribers receive early access to features and help us test them before they come to Twitter. \nThe test will be localized to a single country at first and expand as we learn and observe how people use Edit Tweet. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be paying close attention to how the feature impacts the way people read, write, and engage with Tweets.\nParticipating on Twitter in a way that makes sense to you \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hoping that, with the availability of Edit Tweet, Tweeting will feel more approachable and less stressful. You should be able to participate in the conversation in a way that makes sense to you, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep working on ways that make it feel effortless to do just that. \nTurn on Tweet notifications for @TwitterBlue, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have more to share soon!\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          \nMeasure your launch and connect campaigns using Twitter Brand Surveys\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 3 December 2019\n          \nIntroducing Topics\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 11 November 2019\n          "}

So starting today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making this highly-requested feature available to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com globally.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTake a look below to learn more about Twitter Circle, how it works, and what our community has to say about it.\u00c2\u00a0\nSelecting your circle\nBefore you post on Twitter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now see an option to share your Tweet with either your circle or your full followers list. Circles can contain up to 150 people, and you can adjust who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in and who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out at any time. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, no one will be notified of any changes you make to your circle.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweets sent to your circle will appear with a green badge underneath them. They can only be seen by those you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve selected to be in your circle and cannot be Retweeted or shared. Additionally, all replies to these Tweets are private, even if your Twitter account is public.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou can find more info about Twitter Circle here.\u00c2\u00a0 \nPersonalizing your Twitter experience\nWe want to ensure everyone on Twitter has the choice, control, tools, and transparency to join the conversation how and when they want, and Twitter Circle is another important step in that direction. \nGiving people the option to share thoughts with a select group of followers helps make Tweeting more accessible. This is true whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re brand new to Twitter or you have millions of followers. Since the feature began testing, people have been sharing how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helped them personalize their Twitter experience, including:\nFeeling more comfortable Tweeting and expressing themselves\nEliminating the need for alternate or secondary accounts\nSharing content with a close and evolving group of friends\nAvoiding toggling between protected and public account settings\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nI love Twitter Circle because we all have those Tweets that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the entire world to see so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice to be able to have a space where we can share and laugh with the people we are in community with! Twitter Circle eliminates the fear of the wrong person seeing the wrong Tweet and has allowed me to connect more honestly and purposefully with my followers which is what Twitter is all about.\nTwitter Creator\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@itszaeok\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nI love Twitter Circle because it allows you to curate a community within your community. Someone like me who has a larger platform can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always be as open and connected with my friends the way I want to on Twitter, so this allows me to be able to connect with my broader audience, as well as my personal friends all on the same timeline!\nTwitter Creator\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@seangarrette\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nSome results from our Twitter Circle test include:\nIncreased overall Tweeting\u00c2\u00a0\nIncreased Tweet engagement rate on circle Tweets (Likes and replies)\nTwitter is also committed to incorporating feedback from trusted partners and online safety experts, including the Twitter Trust & Safety Council, into the products and features we build. These groups regularly emphasize the importance of online customization tools in helping people express themselves freely online.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLGBTQ+ youth often opt to creating separate private accounts to feel more comfortable sharing online with people who accept their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To do this in a simple and intuitive way that allows listeners to simply hit play and go, we started with a redesigned audio experience in the Spaces Tab. \nThis redesign introduces personalized hubs that group audio content together by specific themes like News, Music, Sports, and more. Now Twitter listeners will be able to easily access a more personalized selection of live and recorded Spaces discussing the topics that are most relevant to them.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBut the selection doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop there. These new hubs will also feature the most popular and engaging podcasts from around the world. Our internal research indicates that 45% of people who use Twitter in the US also listen to podcasts monthly, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll automatically suggest compelling podcasts to help people easily find and listen to the topics they want to hear more about. For example, if someone regularly interacts with Vox content on Twitter, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably see a Vox podcast in a Spaces hub.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVox Media has a rich array of popular podcasts across many categories, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thrilled that Twitter is expanding its audio capabilities to help more listeners discover them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ray Chao, general manager of audio at Vox Media. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether it's Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pivot,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 our daily news explainer \u00e2\u0080\u0098Today, Explained,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara,' we're excited Twitter is offering users and podcast fans an exciting new frontier.\" \nWant to build a more customized experience?

We aim to enable healthy civic conversation on Twitter, while ensuring people have the context they need to make informed decisions about content they encounter. Because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a global service, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost always an election happening on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re announcing steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking ahead of the US midterms to protect civic conversation on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \nOur Civic Integrity Policy\u00c2\u00a0 \nAs a key part of the Twitter Rules, since 2018, our Civic Integrity Policy has helped people find credible information during elections and other civic processes \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including in the Philippines, Kenya, Australia, Brazil, and India \u00e2\u0080\u0093 just this year.\nToday, as we do ahead of other global elections, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re activating enforcement of our Civic Integrity Policy for the 2022 US midterms.\nThe Civic Integrity Policy covers the most common types of harmful misleading information about elections and civic events, such as: claims about how to participate in a civic process like how to vote, misleading content intended to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in the election, and misleading claims intended to undermine public confidence in an election \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including false information about the outcome of the election. Tweets with this content may be labeled with links to credible information or helpful context, and Twitter will not recommend or amplify this content in areas of the product where Twitter makes recommendations. People on Twitter will see a prompt prior to liking or sharing labeled tweets, and in cases where there is potential for harm associated with the false or misleading claim, the Tweet may not be liked or shared to prevent the spread of the misleading information.\nFake accounts that misrepresent affiliation to a candidate or elected official are prohibited under our existing Misleading & Deceptive Identities Policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we remain vigilant against potential coordinated manipulation efforts. And during this election period, and year-round, we continue to enforce our safety policies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including for conduct targeting election workers. \nRedesigned labels \nLate last year, we tested new misleading information labels and saw promising results. The new labels increased click through rates by 17%, meaning more people were clicking labels to read debunking content. We also saw notable decreases in engagement with Tweets labeled with the new design: -13% in replies, -10% in Retweets and -15% in likes.\u00c2\u00a0\nFinding reliable information \nTwitter wants to empower voters to find reliable information about how to register, how to vote, and the choices on their ballot. To make it easier to find reliable news and accurate information about participating in the civic process, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching a number of product updates.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you can expect to see on Twitter as election day approaches in the US: \nPrebunks\u00c2\u00a0 \nIn the lead up to election day, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share prompts with information about how and where to vote, directly to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s timelines.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also bringing back prebunks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in English, Spanish, and all other languages supported on Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to get ahead of misleading narratives on Twitter, and to proactively address topics that may be the subject of misinformation. Over the coming months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll place prompts directly on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s timelines in the US and in Search when people type related terms, phrases, or hashtags.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nState-specific event hubs\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun rolling out state-specific event hubs as primaries take place across the country. These localized pages feature real-time election information from state election officials, plus local news outlets and journalists.\u00c2\u00a0\nSoon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll roll out an additional, nationally focused Event page, available to everyone in the US.\u00c2\u00a0 \nDedicated Explore tab \nAs elections take place around the world, Twitter often serves as the centralized hub for real-time political conversation, resources, and breaking news. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be launching a dedicated Explore tab that will include:\nNational news in both English and Spanish by reputable news outlets, curated by Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Curation team;\nLocalized news and resources by state;\nVoter education public service announcements (PSAs) in English and Spanish, created using information from nonpartisan government and voting advocacy organizations.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Image of example Explore tab\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nIdentifying who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running for office\nOur candidate account labels make it easier to identify who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running for office. We began rolling out these labels in May, as primary elections kicked into full swing, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to see these labels until the end of the general election. These labels:\nAppear on designated candidate accounts for those running for US Senate, US House of Representatives, or Governor, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve qualified for the general election ballot;\nContain critical candidate information; including the office the candidate is running for, the state the office is located in, and the district number (for US House candidates);\nAppear at the top of the candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile page and on all of their Tweets. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Image of example candidate label\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nImproving recommendations\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also made \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and continue to make \u00e2\u0080\u0093 updates to how and what we recommend on Twitter. Earlier this year, in the US and Brazil, we tested ways to prevent misleading Tweets from being recommended through notifications. Early results show that impressions on misleading information dropped by 1.6 million per month, as a direct result of the experiment.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve since applied this intervention to notification recommendations on Twitter and are exploring possibilities for other surfaces on Twitter. \nProtecting accounts\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re helping to protect and secure accounts of government officials, candidates for office, journalists, and more ahead of the midterms.\u00c2\u00a0\nAccounts will be reminded to use a strong password, encouraged to enable two-factor authentication, and asked to check the third-party apps they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve connected to their accounts. We will also enable password reset protection for accounts by default to help prevent unauthorized password changes. \nIn the coming weeks, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll apply additional proactive safeguards for these accounts, including: \nMore sophisticated detections and alerts to help us, and account holders, respond rapidly to suspicious activity;\nIncreased login defenses to prevent malicious account takeover attempts;\nExpedited account recovery support to ensure account security issues are resolved quickly.\nWe take our role seriously \nTwitter plays a critical role in empowering democratic conversations, facilitating meaningful political debate, and providing information on civic participation \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 not only in the US, but around the world. People deserve to trust the election conversations and content they encounter on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re exploring other ways to help people make sense of content they encounter during these critical times.

As part of that, we have partnered with a number of organisations to further amplify credible information during the Kenyan election.\nElevate Credible Information: One such partner is Africa Check; established in 2012 as the continent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first independent, nonpartisan fact-checking organisation that debunks dangerous statements, and empowers people to engage with information critically, while also building a culture of fact-checking across Africa.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe are pleased to collaborate with Twitter as part of our election work in Kenya. The collaboration will allow us to address dis- and misinformation by fact-checking claims and identifying potential misinformation...Notably, the partnership with Twitter will deepen the impact of our media literacy project as it will allow us to reach a broader audience. \nAfrica Check\nIndependent, nonpartisan fact-checking organisation\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@AfricaCheck\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nIn the build-up to the Kenyan elections, Africa Check - which is part of the\u00c2\u00a0Fumbua\u00c2\u00a0collective, continues to combat false narratives, amplify accurate information and lead the activation of critical media literacy work across the region.\n\"We are pleased to collaborate with Twitter as part of our election work in Kenya. The collaboration will allow us to address dis- and misinformation by fact-checking claims and identifying potential misinformation. We will also highlight accurate, verified information ahead of the election on the platform so that voters can make informed decisions. Media literacy programmes are a proactive strategy to fight misinformation and allow us to use our fact-checking work to inoculate people against false information proactively and empower them to critically understand, analyse, and evaluate information instead of simply consuming and sharing it. We believe this enables them to make evidence-based decisions vital ahead of elections. Notably, the partnership with Twitter will deepen the impact of our media literacy project as it will allow us to reach a broader audience.\" - Africa Check\nThis work is key to the protection of the election conversation and we look forward to continued partnerships and collaboration with Africa Check and all our other partner organisations, up to and after the Kenyan elections.\u00c2\u00a0\nVerification\nAhead of the elections, Twitter worked with Kenyan partner organisations on verifying accounts of Government Agencies, Candidates, Political Parties, Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs), News Organisations and content creators. The blue Verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic and notable - giving people on Twitter more context about who they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having conversations with so they can determine the way in which they engage with a certain account.\nAmplifying Credible Information\u00c2\u00a0\nOur teams are working to ensure that voters in Kenya are directed to credible information while they spend time on our platform. In line with our efforts to amplify credible information, we have been able to launch the following features: \nCustom Kenyan election Emoji: Today we launched a custom Kenyan elections emoji that will be activated by the hashtags #KenyaDecides, #KenyaDecides2022, #electionske #electionske2022. The special emoji, which pictures a ballot box with the Kenyan flag draped around it, aims to promote the discoverability of the election conversation and encourage active citizenship and a peaceful election process.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nKenyan Election Prompt:\u00c2\u00a0We have launched an election prompt in collaboration with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in both English and Swahili. The search prompt is a notification service that directs people in Kenya to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) website where Kenyans will be able to access credible information about the elections when searching for keywords on Twitter, associated with the Kenyan General Election.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Moments:\u00c2\u00a0Our Twitter Curation team is supporting the 2022 Kenyan Elections with the creation of election\u00c2\u00a0Moments which are\u00c2\u00a0curated stories designed to address misleading and false information around the presidential elections.\u00c2\u00a0These\u00c2\u00a0Twitter Moments, will include key dates, and general guidelines for participating in the electoral process from credible sources, including Kenya\u00e2\u0080\u0099s electoral regulator IEBC, media outlets, and fact-checking organizations.\nPolicy enforcement\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition to enforcing our Policies on Hateful Conduct and Abusive Behaviour, we have implemented a clear Civic Integrity Policy so that people\u00c2\u00a0 cannot use Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Policy targets the most directly harmful types of content, such as (but not limited to) misleading information about how to participate in an election or misleading information that intends to intimidate or dissuade people from participating in an election.\nLabeling: As such, in line with this policy, we will label Tweets that contain false or misleading information that undermines confidence in the election or false or misleading information related to the outcomes of the election. Tweets that are labeled under this policy will therefore have reduced visibility (not amplified) across the service and will lead to Twitter Moments with informative context on the topic - based on official, reliable sources and fact-checkers.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLocal engagement\u00c2\u00a0\nOur Sub-Saharan Africa policy team has also offered safety and security training to partner organisations, bringing them through tools such as mute, block and report, as well as various security tips and techniques such as two-factor authentication.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThe established cross-functional 2022 Kenyan elections team at Twitter, will work to protect the integrity of the election-related conversation, support partner groups and political representatives as well as identifying and curbing any threat to the integrity of the 2022 Kenyan election conversation on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe are committed to providing a service that fosters and facilitates political debate and we will continue to build on one of our core priorities, which is to protect political and civic conversation on Twitter through our policies, products and the integral partnerships we have around the world.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSources for relevant election related information\nThe Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and any election officials as determined by the IEBC and the Constitution of Kenya.\nThe National Cohesion and Integration Commission\nThe Kenyan Judiciary\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n--\nUchaguzi Mkuu wa Kenya, 2022 unafanyika kwenye Twitter\nSiku ya Jumanne ya tarehe 9 Agosti, wapiga kura wa Kenya watakuwa wakielekea kwenye vituo vya kupiga kura kwa ajii ya Uchaguzi Mkuu wa mwaka 2022, ambapo watapiga kura kuchagua Raisi mpya, Wabunge, na wawakilishi wa Bunge la Seneta la Kenya.

Over the last 10 years how governments attempt to control free expression, remove content, and reveal the identity of account owners on Twitter has evolved significantly. Meaningful transparency helps people understand the rules of online services and hold governments accountable for their actions, and in turn, helps keep us accountable for principled content moderation and responsiveness to government demands. Transparency is a key guiding principle in our mission to serve the public conversation, protect the Open Internet, and advance the internet as a global force for good. We have and will continue to fight for the people who use Twitter to raise their voice.\nHighlights from our latest report\u00c2\u00a0\nWe continue to see a concerning trend toward attempts to limit global press freedom, with an increase in government legal demands targeting journalists, as well as an overall increasing number of legal demands on accounts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both represent record highs since reporting began.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\nRecord number of legal demands on accounts (47,572 demands on 198,931 accounts)\nAn increase of 103% in legal demands from governments targeting verified journalists and news outlets since the last reporting period\nThe United States accounted for 20% of all global requests Tweet impressions that violated Twitter rules accounted for less than 0.1% of total impressions on all Tweets\nWe objected to 29 US civil requests for account information that sought to unmask the identities of anonymous speakers\nSee the full report here.\nGovernments\u00e2\u0080\u0099 role in transparency reporting\nThis update comes at a time when government requests for account information and content removal continually hit new records, including demands to reveal the identity of anonymous account owners. This is why we continue to advocate for greater transparency from governments themselves about how these powers are used. People who use our service should know that we take a principled approach to how we handle government requests and legal demands and how we share information about people who use our service.\nFor July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the reporting period of the update we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing today) we saw an increase in global legal demands received, a continued upward trend for Twitter.\nFor this reporting period, Twitter received 47,572 legal demands for 198,931 unique accounts, the largest number of accounts we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reported in the past 10 years. This number has continued to increase throughout each reporting period, and we also continue to see similar trends in government requests for information. This reporting period, we received 11,460 such requests.\nGlobally during the latest reporting period:\nTwitter narrowed (meaning we disclosed some information but not all information demanded in the request) or did not disclose any information in response to 60% of global government information requests.\nFor the latest reporting period, 349 accounts of verified journalists and news outlets located all around the world were subject to 326 legal demands, a 103% increase since the previous reporting period and a record high since we started tracking this important metric, which is all the more important at a time when freedom of the press is strained globally.\nFrom the US during the last reporting period:\nGovernment information requests originating from the US made up the highest percentage among requesting countries from around the world.\nWith the exception of the second half of 2020, US information requests have represented the largest share of total global volume in a reporting period since Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first transparency report in 2012.\n20% of all global requests for account information originated from the United States during this reporting period.\nThese requests accounted for 39% of all accounts specified from around the world. Twitter complied, in whole or in part, with 69% of these U.S. information requests.\nWe objected to 29 US civil requests for account information that sought to unmask the identities of anonymous speakers on First Amendment grounds.\u00c2\u00a0\nOf those 29 requests, we filed lawsuits to fight back in two instances and succeeded in convincing courts to apply First Amendment protections in one case. The other case remains pending.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs in past reports, Twitter is not reporting on any other requests for information deemed to be related to national security processes because of limitations imposed on us by the U.S. government. We have been fighting for more transparency around this process for years, and continue to fight this issue in our court case, Twitter v. Garland, and are currently awaiting a decision on appeal.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe strongly believe in providing data and information that is straightforward and provides insights into the types of requests we receive from governments and others around the world. To this end, we also upload legal requests directly into the Lumen Database, a project by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. We encourage the public to explore this site to get a sense of the day-to-day queries we receive from governments and other entities around the world.\nInvestments in technology\u00c2\u00a0\nIn 2012, we were the first social media company to publish a transparency report, and since then it has become an industry standard. Over the past decade, we have made significant investments and developed our reporting including more data, insights and metrics. Since we first reported data behind our enforcement of the Twitter Rules in 2018, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve significantly evolved our approach to how we detect and take down content that is against our rules. The biggest impact we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in this work is through our use of technology to proactively take down content quickly, oftentimes without that content ever needing to be reported by people on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re iterating on the way that we measure our effectiveness and have worked to move beyond the binary \u00e2\u0080\u009cleave up\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake down\u00e2\u0080\u009d traditional approach to content moderation. For this reporting period, we required the removal of more than four million Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules. We also deploy less aggressive enforcement actions by labeling Tweets to add important context when the information shared doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t warrant Tweet deletion, and have improved the way we make certain questionable content from accounts you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow don't appear in replies, search, or on your Home Timeline. In future transparency reporting, we aim to share details on these measures in more specific ways, eventually making this data core to our reporting.\nOne way we measure the efficacy of our investments in technology is by sharing how many impressions violative Tweets received before they are removed. For this reporting period, impressions on these violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of total impressions on all Tweets. Of the Tweets removed, 71% received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 21% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. These numbers have remained consistent since we first began reporting this data in 2020, even as the volume of rule-violating content we remove has generally trended upward \u00e2\u0080\u0094 indicating that our efforts at proactive detection are keeping pace with changing behavior. We continue to invest heavily in improving both the speed and comprehensiveness of our detections. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nGetting better at tackling platform manipulation and spam\nAs a result of continued investment in our approach and our ongoing efforts to disrupt spam attacks on our service, for this reporting period, our teams deployed a 2% increase in global anti-spam challenges compared to the last reporting period. When we detect suspicious levels of activity, accounts may be locked and prompted to provide additional information (e.g., a phone number) or to solve a reCAPTCHA. This nominal increase is related to ongoing efforts to disrupt spam attacks on our service. Further, during the second half of 2021, we received 6% more spam reports from people using Twitter compared to the previous reporting period.\nDuring the past 10 years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made significant investments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and seen significant progress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in how we detect and take action against spam and platform manipulation, and give people on Twitter more context in their experience. One such example is around automated accounts. Automated accounts can be a source of useful, entertaining, and relevant information on Twitter. We launched Automated Account Labels in September 2021 to make it easier for people to be able to identify these \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood bots\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As of February 2022, all automated accounts globally have the option to self-identify.\nTo view more on our work, check out this Tweet thread from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTransparency with our data\nFrom Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beginnings in 2006, our uniquely open and public APIs (application programming interfaces) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which, at a high level, are the way computer programs \u00e2\u0080\u009ctalk\u00e2\u0080\u009d to each other so they can request and deliver information \u00e2\u0080\u0093 have given researchers and developers the opportunity to tap into what is happening in the world. Twitter is the only major service to make public conversation data available via an API, for research purposes.\u00c2\u00a0\nOpen access to public data is critical for advancing research objectives on a wide range of topics in a safe way that ensures public privacy is protected. It raises general awareness and understanding of the scale and nature of the challenges impacting public conversation online, and it also helps to keep services like Twitter accountable for our own response to these challenges.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditionally, throughout the pandemic, we launched a COVID-19 endpoint to empower public health research, and a new academic platform to encourage cutting-edge research using Twitter data. This is one of the reasons you hear more about reports featuring Twitter as core to the research methodology \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we intentionally empower this.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nTransparency is key to building and sustaining trust, improving accountability, and preserving a free and secure Open Internet. People should understand the rules of online services and the way that governmental legal powers are used. Without transparency, there can be no accountability.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor our part, Twitter aims to continually evaluate and improve the way we share information with the public. This year, we are launching the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC). Through the Consortium, Twitter shares large-scale datasets concerning platform moderation issues with a global group of public interest researchers from across academia, civil society, NGOs and journalism studying platform governance issues. This program will initially focus on sharing data about accounts and networks Twitter has removed in connection with platform manipulation and state-backed information operations, enabling credible, reputable academics and researchers to find insights in and contextualize the data.\nWhile the way that we have reported this information has continually developed and improved over the past 10 years, our commitment to protecting the people who use Twitter remains unchanged. That includes protecting activists and journalists, accounts that wish to remain anonymous, and those who speak up against their own governments.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo view the full report, click here. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced our fair share at Twitter\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and\u00c2\u00a0across our industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yet our focus remains steady. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing our work to support our Tweepforce with our global Business Resource Groups (BRGs) front and center. As we welcome change, our commitment does not waver: we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a journey to become the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible (IDEA) tech company.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAlong the way, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced a global pandemic, war outbreaks, waves of inequity and unfair treatment, and violence toward historically-excluded communities, and ongoing global uncertainty. Each new challenge adds more urgency to our work \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0to do even more and keep showing up for our Tweeps around the world when and where they need us most.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhile the global macro-economic environment has triggered a slowdown in hiring across the industry, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still making progress against our 2025 Tweepforce representation goals, just not as fast or evenly as before. (Take a look at our Q2 2022 diversity data.) As\u00c2\u00a0 we navigate the challenges, our new reality also presents an opportunity for us to double down on inclusion. In fact, during times of macro-economic uncertainty, investments in the principles of inclusion and allyship improve outcomes for everyone.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCalling all allies\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSimply put, it's during times of uncertainty when allies are needed most. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on empowering even more allies to stand in solidarity with Tweeps and continue to cultivate a truly inclusive culture. To recap, our allyship principles are:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLearn.\u00c2\u00a0Challenge your assumptions. Seek out information that expands your worldview.\nAsk.\u00c2\u00a0Ask people about their unique lived experiences. Learn the personal journeys of others.\nShow up.\u00c2\u00a0Go where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re invited. Be present, engage authentically. \nSpeak up.\u00c2\u00a0Your voice has power. Use it to intervene on behalf of and advocate for others.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAllyship is not who you are, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you do. At Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve introduced a portfolio of IDEA learning and development courses in recent years to underscore our first principle of allyship and empower all Tweeps with the knowledge and understanding to show up and do the work every day. Today, we share how we got there.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n#UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe introduced the first iteration of our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) trainings in 2019. Initially designed as an allyship resource, the coursework eventually evolved into three learning modules:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAllyship 101:\u00c2\u00a0A deep dive into our four principles.\nWords Matter:\u00c2\u00a0Geared towards unlearning microaggressions.\nHealthy Conversations:\u00c2\u00a0Learn the skills and practices that make everyday conversations on tough topics healthy and straightforward.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs Tweeps dove into the coursework, they shared feedback and we learned a lot. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our key takeaways:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a high demand for this type of coursework. It should be ongoing and always-on. \nNot all courses should be mandatory for all Tweeps \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but managers are expected to understand the fundamentals.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a global company, but regional context matters.\nWe need to meaningfully embed equity and accessibility into everything we do.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBased on those findings, our IDEA and Learning & Development (L&D) teams joined forces to create the #UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new, expanded portfolio of self-paced e-learnings that empowers Tweeps to double down on their IDEA learning journey and ensure that our entire Tweepforce is equipped with the tools and resources to drive inclusion at the individual and team level. The toolkit complements the many outstanding courses available for Tweeps via our L&D team including our leadership development programs for Women (WELead and Chief) and underrepresented Tweeps (The Power of Choice and McKinsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Black & Latinx Leadership Academy).\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe #UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit is available to all Tweeps, from day one, as they begin (or continue) their IDEA learning journey with us. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also required coursework for all managers at Twitter. We took this approach with managers because of the unique role they play in promoting the health of their teams and fostering a truly inclusive environment. It introduces five new e-learnings that focus on IDEA topics frequently requested across our Tweepforce:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAllyship 101:\u00c2\u00a0Practicing authentic allyship is critical. This e-learning will introduce you to Twitter's Four Principles of Allyship and ways you can practice allyship right now.\nAnti-Racism 101:\u00c2\u00a0Begin to understand and practice anti-racism as a mindset and learn how to apply it to your everyday work.\nBreaking Down Bias:\u00c2\u00a0Having biases is a normal part of the human brain function. But we all need to work to recognize, unpack, and interrupt those biases to maintain a more inclusive and diverse workplace.\nInclusive Leadership:\u00c2\u00a0Anyone, regardless of level of seniority, role, or tenure can be a part of creating an inclusive workplace. Learn the principles of Inclusive Leadership. \nWords Matter: Microaggressions communicate messages of exclusion, based on someone's identity. They are not always intentional or obvious so it's important to be aware of them and how they impact people.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo ensure the coursework is globally inclusive, our IDEA team offers live sessions that serve as companions to the e-learnings and allow for exploration and workshopping of regional/country issues or with a particular team. For example, following all-team participation in our \u00e2\u0080\u0098Breaking Down Bias\u00e2\u0080\u0099 e-learning, teams can opt to participate in a Bias Disruption Workshop. This allows Tweeps who work together to explore their IDEA maturity levels\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 both as a team and individually\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and where bias may show up in their working environment, as well as develop a charter of practical interventions and behaviors to disrupt that bias.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe courses in the #UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit were designed for Tweeps, with our unique culture and needs in mind. But the coursework covers important topics that are timely and relevant beyond the walls of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 many companies and communities grapple with the same themes. And because this work takes all of us, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to share the courses from Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s #UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit publicly here today for anyone to take.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhile we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of this new offering, it's just the beginning. The toolkit and coursework is intended to grow and evolve with us as we drive our work forward.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPrioritizing equity and accessibility\nAt the end of last year, we expanded the remit of our team from Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) to Inclusion, Diversity, Equity & Accessibility (IDEA). We did this to reflect work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already underway to center equity and accessibility across all that we do.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEquity lens We define Equity as ensuring that each individual has access to what they need to be successful, acknowledging that, given our unique identities and different relationships to power and privilege, we all start from different places. Distinct from equality, this concept of fairness and justice takes into consideration historical and current privilege, marginalization, and challenges systemic oppression.  Tactically, that means we practice \"equity-mindfulness\" by centering the needs and experiences of our most vulnerable populations\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 both in the annual planning process (with the help of equity impact assessments) and on an ongoing basis (through equity primers).  Building on our longstanding public work in pay equity and our internal efforts around performance and promotion equity, our IDEA business partnering team\u00c2\u00a0(working across Twitter to create equitable and meaninful connections) is currently piloting an equity training aimed at developing equity fluency in program design. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share more about that program in upcoming blogs.\nAccessibility Making Twitter more accessible is all of our work. Our Center of Excellence for Accessibility\u00c2\u00a0 regularly hosts internal trainings and provides support to embed accessibility principles across Twitter including Marketing and Communications, People, Studio, Twitter Next, Customers, Real Estate & Workplace (REW), and ArtHouse teams. This work complements the efforts already underway on the product accessibility team (AET) to ensure our service is accessible to everyone who uses Twitter. As we build on this work, we hope to eventually evolve the materials into a stand-alone e-learning focused on accessibility that will become part of the #UntilWeAllBelong toolkit for everyone to experience.  In addition to launching workshops to support our business partners, our Center of Excellence for Accessibility also launched an accessible meetings and events policy and a new internal, streamlined process to enable meeting and event hosts to provide accessibility features for in-person and virtual events, as well as meetings by default. The new policy has removed the burden on Tweeps with disabilities to request accommodations for company-wide meetings/events.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTaking our toolkit public\nTransparency drives the work we do at Twitter. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we make strides in serving the public conversation. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, with the publishing of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s IDEA Q2 Report, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making the resources in the #UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit available to everyone. We believe equipping candidates, customers, peers, and the people who use our service the opportunity to join us on our IDEA journey will create a stronger, more equitable world. \u00c2\u00a0So, while learning is the first step to our allyship principles, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a critical part of cultivating a culture of belonging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 wherever you are. Taking our toolkit public is one step forward but our work is not done.  Change is inevitable, but while the road ahead is long \u00e2\u0080\u0093 progress is certain. And we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop #UntilWeAllBelong.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@TwitterTogether\n#UntilWeAllBelong\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndiversity\n#UntilWeAllBelong\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          \nInclusion & Diversity Report May 2020: Principles during a pandemic\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 27 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

The recently announced Data Governance Committee is an embodiment of our dedication to strengthen the implementation of our privacy and security policies and standards, as well as to expand our internal privacy and security review processes during the product development life cycle.\nMoving forward, we will continue to make investments in this work, including building and evolving processes, implementing technical measures, and conducting regular auditing and reporting to ensure we are mitigating risk at every level and function at Twitter. We will also continue to partner with the FTC, and our security and privacy regulators around the world, on our shared mission of building useful products and services that meet our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs while keeping the information they share with us secure and respectful of their privacy.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nprivacy\nsecurity\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Every day, the Twitter for Good team brings company and community together as a force for good through various partnerships and activations. However, on Twitter for Good Day, everyone at Twitter is encouraged to participate in activities that benefit their local communities. This year marks a return for many to in-person volunteering, something that was largely paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the pandemic, our teams were able to adapt and still hold four virtual Twitter for Good Days.\nWhether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s training students in online safety and media literacy skills, serving meals and playing bingo with seniors, or conducting mock interviews with aspiring tech professionals, Twitter for Good Day is a chance to get out and learn about our neighbors and collectively make a difference where we live and work. Follow #TwitterForGood to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening around the world.\nMilestones for our employee matching program\nToday also marks a total of $10 million dollars donated through our employee matching program since its launch in August of 2018. Since its inception, the program has evolved significantly, including a ten-fold increase in the number of organizations we support. Tweeps have been especially successful at launching their own personal campaigns, raising dollars from friends and family to then use against our employee match.\u00c2\u00a0\nDuring major world events, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also increased the number of dollars matched by Twitter, surging to match three times the amount donated during events of particular interest to Tweeps and in support of causes and organizations they care about. Thus far, our employees have donated to 3,318 organizations in 50 countries.\nLaunching ArtHouse for Good\nArtHouse, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in-house content creation team for brands, and Twitter for Good have joined forces to launch ArtHouse for Good, a new social impact initiative that helps nonprofit organizations amplify their voice on Twitter.\nOver the past year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve collaborated with partners around the world to elevate their content through pro bono, world-class creative content production and consultation. This includes editing and optimizing content, bringing in\u00c2\u00a0 talented artists and creators, and providing strategic guidance around best practices on Twitter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also worked in lockstep with our creative colleagues on Twitter NEXT to bring these projects to life. Here are a few examples:\u00c2\u00a0\nPromoting environmental conservation with IPAM Amazoni\nWe partnered with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) to raise awareness of the deforestation crisis happening in the Amazon forest.

During periods of crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as situations of armed conflict, public health emergencies, and large-scale natural disasters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 access to credible, authoritative information and resources is all the more critical.\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing our crisis misinformation policy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a global policy that will guide our efforts to elevate credible, authoritative information, and will help to ensure viral misinformation isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t amplified or recommended by us during crises. In times of crisis, misleading information can undermine public trust and cause further harm to already vulnerable communities. Alongside our existing work to make reliable information more accessible during crisis events, this new approach will help to slow the spread by us of the most visible, misleading content, particularly that which could lead to severe harms. \nDeveloping the policy \nTeams at Twitter have worked to develop a crisis misinformation framework since last year, drawing on key input from global experts and human rights organizations. For the purposes of this policy, we define crises as situations in which there is a widespread threat to life, physical safety, health, or basic subsistence. This definition is consistent with the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 definition of a humanitarian crisis and other humanitarian assessments.\nDown the line, as we expand our approach, we will enforce around other emergent global crises, informed by the United Nations Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emergency response framework, and other global humanitarian frameworks. \nAddressing the most severe harms \nDuring moments of crisis, establishing whether something is true or false can be exceptionally challenging. To determine whether claims are misleading, we require verification from multiple credible, publicly available sources, including evidence from conflict monitoring groups, humanitarian organizations, open-source investigators, journalists, and more.\u00c2\u00a0\nConversation moves quickly during periods of crisis, and content from accounts with wide reach are most likely to rack up views and engagement. To reduce potential harm, as soon as we have evidence that a claim may be misleading, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t amplify or recommend content that is covered by this policy across Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including in the Home timeline, Search, and Explore. In addition, we will prioritize adding warning notices to highly visible Tweets and Tweets from high profile accounts, such as state-affiliated media accounts, verified, official government accounts.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSome examples of Tweets that we may add a warning notice to include:\u00c2\u00a0\nFalse coverage or event reporting, or information that mischaracterizes conditions on the ground as a conflict evolves;\nFalse allegations regarding use of force, incursions on territorial sovereignty, or around the use of weapons;\nDemonstrably false or misleading allegations of war crimes or mass atrocities against specific populations;\nFalse information regarding international community response, sanctions, defensive actions, or humanitarian operations.\nStrong commentary, efforts to debunk or fact check, and personal anecdotes or first person accounts do not fall within the scope of the policy.\nWhat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see on Twitter\nTweets with content that violate the crisis misinformation policy will be placed behind a warning notice that looks like this:\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Image of crisis misinformation warning notice\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nPeople on Twitter will be required to click through the warning notice to view the Tweet, and the content won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be amplified or recommended across the service. In addition, Likes, Retweets, and Shares will be disabled, and the notice will link to more information about our approach to crisis misinformation.\u00c2\u00a0\nContent moderation is more than just leaving up or taking down content, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve expanded the range of actions we may take to ensure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proportionate to the severity of the potential harm. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that not amplifying or recommending certain content, adding context through labels, and in severe cases, disabling engagement with the Tweets, are effective ways to mitigate harm, while still preserving speech and records of critical global events.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWhile this first iteration is focused on international armed conflict, starting with the war in Ukraine, we plan to update and expand the policy to include additional forms of crisis. The policy will supplement our existing work deployed during other global crises, such as in\u00c2\u00a0Afghanistan, Ethiopia, and India. \nYou can read more about our crisis misinformation policy in the Help Center. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ncrisis response\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Today \u00e2\u0080\u0093 on #EarthDay2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing more about our work to serve the climate conversations happening across Twitter, plus the latest on our own sustainability commitments.\u00c2\u00a0 \nClimate-forward approach to ads\u00c2\u00a0\nPeople around the world use Twitter to connect with others passionate about protecting our planet. Last year, we introduced a dedicated Topic to help people find personalized conversations about climate change. And, to support conversation around #COP26, we rolled out pre-bunks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hubs of credible, authoritative information across a range of key themes, like the science backing climate change, made available in the Explore tab, Search, and Trends.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo better serve these conversations, misleading advertisements on Twitter that contradict the scientific consensus on climate change are prohibited, in line with our inappropriate content policy. We believe that climate denialism shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be monetized on Twitter, and that misrepresentative ads shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t detract from important conversations about the climate crisis. This approach is informed by authoritative sources, like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Reports.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe recognize that misleading information about climate change can undermine efforts to protect the planet. In the coming months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have more to share on our work to add reliable, authoritative context to the climate conversations happening on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSustainability at Twitter \nWe continue to accelerate our sustainability efforts, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re laser focused on reducing our own carbon footprint. Through targeted work, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lowered our emissions for the second straight year \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even as the company grew.\nIn 2019, we shared plans to achieve 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. With the help of our partners at Watershed, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be utilizing zero-carbon electricity for all of our data centers, and for surrounding offices in the US and Canada. Our Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are sourced from solar and wind power projects in the same geographic region in which energy was used, and cover 100% of Scope 2 emissions from these sites.\u00c2\u00a0 \nEarlier this year, we joined the EU climate pact, committing to ambitious North Star and Pathway pledges, in line with Paris Agreement goals. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to transitioning to renewable electricity in all our EU leased operations; using 100% carbon-neutral energy in our directly leased buildings by 2025; and upping our investments in carbon removal technologies.\u00c2\u00a0 \nIn 2021, we were proud to join the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actively pursuing those targets. By 2030, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re set to have significantly reduced our greenhouse gas emissions, paving the way for our net-zero journey.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSince 2020, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve measurably advanced our CDP score, achieving a B grade for our comprehensive reporting on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustainability efforts. We believe\u00c2\u00a0that transparency should be central to our approach to sustainability.\u00c2\u00a0We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to report on our progress, providing regular, public-facing updates against our declared targets.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nClimate community \nTackling the climate crisis requires meaningful, sustained collaboration. Through #AdsForGood grants, on-service support, trainings, and more, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re partnering with organizations committed to environmental conservation and sustainability. These include\u00c2\u00a0Earth Day Network,\u00c2\u00a0United Nations (UN) Environment Programme,\u00c2\u00a0UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,\u00c2\u00a0UN Development Programme,\u00c2\u00a0Greenpeace,\u00c2\u00a0Voice for the Planet,\u00c2\u00a0Let Me Breathe,\u00c2\u00a0WWF,\u00c2\u00a0350.org,\u00c2\u00a0FridaysForFuture,\u00c2\u00a0We Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Have Time,\u00c2\u00a0Climate Reality Project, and others.\nWhat people are saying \nThe climate conversation happening on Twitter is ever-expanding and uniquely global. Since 2021, conversation about sustainability has grown by more than 150%. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a 60%+ increase in terms like \u00e2\u0080\u009crestoring\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009crebalancing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Discussion around waste reduction has increased by over 100%, and decarbonization by more than 50%. We know that protecting the environment is something that people on Twitter care about, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always thinking about other ways to serve these conversations.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow to get involved \nWe all have a part we can play in tackling this urgent, global crisis. From volunteering with an environmental organization in your community, to joining a Twitter Space with environmental experts, to learning more about protecting our planet, there are lots of ways to get involved.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe encourage you to Tweet along with the #EarthDay2022 conversation happening on Twitter and follow the Climate Change\u00c2\u00a0Topic\u00c2\u00a0for more.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nThe Twitter NeighborNest turns four\n            \n            \n             Friday, 7 June 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \n#TwitterForGood Day around the world\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 December 2016\n          "}

Since we announced our five-year Tweepforce representation goals at the top of 2020, we have made great strides in Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve accelerated in the United States and are purposefully investing more IDEA resources globally because this work isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bound to one region or country.

We are particularly conscious of the need to do even more to diversify our leadership, invest in Women talent globally, and close the gap for representation of US Latinx talent. View our latest numbers on our Careers site.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOne thing is clear from these numbers: we are on track to achieve our 2025 vision for representation of talent from underrepresented US populations\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 a full two years early.\u00c2\u00a0 As we approach that milestone, we are mindful that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a new vision for Tweepforce representation, and it must be globally inclusive. With that, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a deeper look at the global work that will inform our approach: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nExpanding Global Self-ID\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur path always starts with cultivating a company that reflects the diversity of the amazing people who use our service every day. Until 2021, Tweeps had the opportunity to voluntarily self-report race and ethnicity (in the US) and gender (globally). We knew we needed to go further if we were to build out a globally inclusive approach, so we redesigned our Self-ID program. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an overview:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat is Self-ID?\u00c2\u00a0Self-ID refers to the process by which employers invite employees to voluntarily share certain personal information with their employer to inform inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility efforts.\u00c2\u00a0At Twitter, we expanded Self-ID to include more categories for all Tweeps around the world. Categories on our new Self-ID questionnaire include disability, gender identity, military service, race, and sexual orientation. We also ask about caregiver status, education, language, religion, and socio-economic background. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking these bold steps to propel our company and industry forward. Check out our Self-ID questionnaire below.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPDF\nSelf-ID Questionnaire\n#UntilWeAllBelong\nDownload\nHow did we approach expanding Self-ID?\u00c2\u00a0Our new Global Self-ID system was built from the ground up with input from a number of cross-functional stakeholders, including:\nGlobal Business Resource Group (BRG) Leaders: Knowing we cannot accurately capture 100% of all identities that make up our Tweepforce, our first step was to align with our BRG communities. The cultural insights and competencies they brought to the work from the very outset ensured the questions we asked were relevant and as inclusive as can be. They also played a key role as champions and advocates to drive participation across Twitter.\nSystems & Testing: Our People Systems team reviewed a number of survey tools and systems, assessing each for accessibility, capability and suitability to achieve optimum user experience and data analysis. We ultimately decided on a bespoke Workday/AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) platform that allowed for key functionality, including the ability to multi-select answers and next level drop down options based on what a Tweep selected.\nAccessibility: Our Center Of Excellence for Accessibility and IT teams worked to ensure compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines \u00e2\u0080\u009cAA\u00e2\u0080\u009d standards so that Self-ID is free from barriers which could prevent access for assistive technology users. While this represents a significant step forward, we have more work to do to ensure we are accessible to all\u00e2\u0080\u0094 at Twitter, and on Twitter.\nLegal: Our Legal teams led efforts to adhere to local laws enabling us to invite 97% of all Tweeps to voluntarily share who they are. Acknowledging there are some markets where it is not advisable/legally permissible to ask for certain sensitive personal information, we provided an anonymous survey.\nPrivacy: Our Privacy team ensured we adhered to complex data privacy issues globally. In offices with a very small number of employees and where Self-ID disclosures would be potentially identifiable, raising data privacy concerns, we were unable to expand the Self-ID program. Additionally, we aligned with our Privacy team on data access, storage and deletion to ensure we build trust in the Self-ID program.\nCommunications: Our internal communications team partnered on a multi-channel socialization strategy that our HRBPs and BRGs evangelized for maximum Tweep awareness and participation, including: how-to videos, data privacy and consent messaging, extensive FAQs, dedicated intranet landing site, executive champions & messaging, and a campaign video.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nGlobal Diversity Framework\nAs a global company, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mindful that the diversity of our Tweeps across regions is vast. Against this backdrop, it is not always easy to even define diversity categories at a global level. So, to complement what we learned about our Tweeps through our expanded Self-ID, we conducted research to learn about the global markets where Twitter has a presence and developed a Global Diversity Framework to help us define diversity and inform how we approach this work across regions. Two key findings inform our Global Diversity Framework:\nThere are a number of categories and underrepresented populations that all international regions have in common, including Gender, Ethnicity & Race, Disability, and LGBTQ+, which we are adapting as priority focus areas.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere is also a range of country-specific underrepresented and historically-excluded communities related to language, religion, and socio-economic status in International regions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSo what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ahead?\nSelf-ID and our Global Diversity Framework are just the beginning and have already provided us a lens to ensure our IDEA programming is regionally relevant\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially for historically-excluded communities.\nIn short, these two programs are designed to consciously include. They will help us evaluate the equity of our policies, procedures, and programs like professional development, mentorship, and sponsorship, as well as promotions and performance management. Critically, the combination of Self-ID and the Global Diversity Framework helps us identify representation gaps in every part, level, and region of Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 along with the evidence base to set goals and targets for global inclusion into the future.\nAs we prepare to introduce a new globally-inclusive Tweepforce representation five-year vision at the end of this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not waiting around.\u00c2\u00a0This year, we will pilot targeted hiring programs in each of the international regions focusing on Women in engineering and tech in Ireland, India, Singapore and the UK, as well as Black talent in Brazil.\nWe know increasing representation is as much about talent retention as it is about talent acquisition so we will continue to focus on our inclusion programming and leadership development globally. Building on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve detailed in our Cultivating Inclusion blog from July 2021, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some recent work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking forward to next:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nGlobal BRG Leadership:\u00c2\u00a0We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made great progress in expanding our global BRG leadership in international regions. In 2019 we set a goal to have at least 25% of our BRG Global Leadership team outside the US. Today, 30% of our Global Chairs/leadership now hail from International regions including Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Singapore, UAE, and the UK.\n#UntilWeAllBelong Toolkit:\u00c2\u00a0We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding our IDEA-focused Learning & Development courses designed to cultivate inclusive Tweeps and leaders. The self-paced e-learnings will include Words Matter, Allyship 101, Working Across Cultures, Inclusive Leadership, Anti-Racism 101, Breaking Down Bias, and Accessibility 101. To further enhance international region-specific learning, we also provide tailored IDEA Training to allow for exploration and workshopping of live issues in a particular country or team. \nExpanding Global Mentorship:\u00c2\u00a0Mentorship is crucial for professional development and career advancement, and yet we know that access to mentorship is historically inequitable. Mentoring@ was created to be intentionally inclusive and globally accessible. Initially piloted across our BRG communities and welcoming 1,000 participants in the first round, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just launched the second round and will expand company-wide this year. \nSponsorship:\u00c2\u00a0We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to introduce a Sponsorship program for mid-level talent in 2022. Building on Mentoring@, this program will pair executives as sponsors with talent from historically-excluded backgrounds and senior Women Tweeps, and will facilitate expedited career advancement opportunities.\nExecutive development:\u00c2\u00a0To complement our existing suite of development programs, we introduced a new executive development program for women at the highest levels to expand their influence. We also have a personalized leadership development initiative to increase and accelerate the impact of high performers and critical talent from under-represented populations. \n#UntilWeAllBelong Summit:\u00c2\u00a0Following the sun, the 2021 summit kicked off in Singapore and featured live programming across JAPAC, EMEA, LATAM, and the US. We tackled timely regional topics and normalized important discussions about culture, diversity, accessibility, equity, and social justice. We also celebrated the progress and had frank conversations about the work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left to do. Planning for the 2022 summit is underway.

Our top priority is to promote the safety of people on and off the service, and our teams are working diligently to that end.\nWe believe we have a responsibility to the public \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly during periods of crisis \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to proactively enforce our rules, preserve access to Twitter, elevate credible and reliable information, protect the privacy and safety of the people who use our service and others, and guard against efforts to manipulate the public conversation. \nOver the past several weeks, people in Ukraine, Russia, and around the world have used Twitter to share critical information in real-time, locate support, connect with one another, and raise their voices. Unfortunately, we are also aware that Twitter is being restricted for some people in Russia. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said previously, we believe that a free and open internet is vital, and that people around the world should have the same access to information. We take our collective role, and the role of our service, seriously.\u00c2\u00a0\nBelow, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing updates to our approach and more detailed information about our efforts.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nElevating reliable information\nGiven the important role that algorithms play in recommending and amplifying content online, we believe that content moderation must extend beyond the leave-up-take-down binary. Our approach is two-fold:\nIf content is in violation of the Twitter Rules, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take enforcement action against it at the Tweet or account level \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this includes content removal.\nWhen the risks for immediate harm associated with a Tweet are less severe, but where left uncontextualized may mislead people, we focus on reducing its reach and not proactively amplifying the Tweets into peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 timelines. De-amplifying content significantly reduces its visibility and labels add important context.\nFrom Home Timeline to Explore, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making it easier to find reliable updates and information and enhance safety.\nOur curated Twitter Moments about the war in Ukraine share real-time news and resources in multiple languages, and since the beginning of the conflict, the moments have had more than 38.6 billion impressions.**\nCurators have contextualized ~3,000 related Trends\u00c2\u00a0in 17 countries and seven languages since the beginning of the crisis, helping Twitter users answer the question \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy is this trending?\u00e2\u0080\u009d by attaching representative Tweets, writing explanatory titles and descriptions, or associating these Trends to Moments to give users even more context.** \nOur Search and Home Timeline prompts surface critical digital safety and security resources in English, Ukrainian, and Russian.\nOur dedicated event pages are available in 12 languages and in more than 67 countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we continue to expand this tool.\nWe created a Topic to help people stay informed right in the Home Timeline, as well as a Twitter List featuring reliable news sources.\nFor people using Twitter in Ukraine and Russia, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve paused some Tweet recommendations from people not followed on Home Timeline to reduce the risk of spreading unhealthy content.\u00c2\u00a0\nMore broadly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working across features like Topics, Lists, and Spaces to reinforce safety measures and guard against misuse \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important these tools are reliable and trustworthy.\nOur approach to state-affiliated media\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSince 2020, we have not recommended or amplified state-affiliated media accounts from certain countries and have added labels, including to Russian-linked entities. Last month, we expanded our approach, adding labels to Tweets that share links to Russian state-affiliated media websites. Much of the content from state-affiliated media came from these link shares, and not just from the accounts we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been labeling as state-affiliated media.\u00c2\u00a0\nSince February 28, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve labeled more than 910,175\u00c2\u00a0unique Tweets\u00c2\u00a0that contain links to Russian state-affiliated media.** As noted above, and as is standard with our labels, these Tweets are not eligible for amplification, meaning they aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommended in your home timeline, notifications, and other places on Twitter. Our interventions continue to make a difference in decreasing the reach of this content. (a selection of early results from the effect of these interventions showed a 30% reduction of the reach of this content*).\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now begun adding additional labels to multiple state-affiliated media accounts from Belarus. We have also labeled one state-affiliated media account in Ukraine. As the conflict \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and online conversation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 evolves, we want to equip people on Twitter with context and enable informed experiences on the service.\u00c2\u00a0 We believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated with a state actor. \nDuring periods of conflict, enabling access to factual, reliable information, and making clear which accounts are controlled by participating states, is critical.\u00c2\u00a0 To serve this mission, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll apply government and state-affiliated media labels to states engaged in inter-state conflict, in addition to those countries already covered by our existing work. The policy will help ensure we add context to conversations about global conflicts equitably. We intend to expand on our approach, labeling more countries over time.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThe recently announced European Union (EU) sanctions legally require us to withhold certain state-affiliated media content in EU member states, and we are complying with this requirement. Our global approach outside of the EU will continue to focus on de-amplifying this type of state-affiliated media content across our service and providing important context through our labels.\u00c2\u00a0 \nOur approach to government labels \nWe are labeling qualifying government accounts to provide additional context. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be rolling out government account labels to Ukrainian government accounts.\n5 April 2022\nA free and open internet is vital, and people around the world should have equal and shared access to information. When a government blocks or limits access to online services within their state, undercutting the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice and ability to freely access information, but continues to use online services for their own communications, a severe information imbalance is created. Particularly in moments of active, armed interstate conflict, the harms created by this imbalance are acute; access to information, and to the ability to share information, are of paramount importance.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe seek to promote open access to information through public conversation. To address the harmful dynamics created by blocks and limitations on online services, we will not amplify or recommend government accounts belonging to states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether Twitter is blocked in that country or not. This means these accounts won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be amplified or recommended to people on Twitter, including across the Home Timeline, Explore, Search, and other places on the service. We will first apply this policy to government accounts belonging to Russia. \nAttempts by states to limit or block access to free information within their borders are uniquely harmful, and run counter to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s belief in healthy and open public conversation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to treating conversations about global conflicts more equitably, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to evaluate whether this policy may be applied in other contexts, beyond interstate armed conflict.\u00c2\u00a0\nOn broader rule enforcement \nAs we do around major global events, our safety and integrity teams are actively monitoring for potential risks. We recognize some high-profile accounts, including those of journalists (especially female journalists), activists, agencies, and government officials, may be particularly vulnerable. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to mitigate any attempts at targeted account takeover or manipulation and have made account security resources available in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. We are also working with our partners around the world, including members of our Trust and Safety Council, to identify and escalate urgent requests for support from journalists, activists, and others in need of assistance.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe continue to proactively assess for inauthentic behavior and other violations of our rules. As of April 2022, we had removed more than 100,000 accounts*\u00c2\u00a0for violations of our platform manipulation and spam policy and this work continues today through proactive detection and human review. These accounts represent a wide range of attempts to manipulate the service \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including opportunistic, financially-motivated spam \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t currently believe they represent a specific, coordinated campaign associated with a government actor.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe have also seen a substantial increase in the volume of media shared with deceptive, misleading, or inaccurate context, including old videos of conflicts, shared as if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking place in Ukraine. In line with our synthetic and manipulated media policy, we have labeled or removed more than 66,407 pieces of content.** \nOur teams are proactively monitoring for violations of our hateful conduct policy and rules prohibiting the promotion of violence, and will continue to enforce against accounts or Tweets targeting people on the basis of their nationality and other groups as new narratives emerge. In line with our abusive behavior policy, specifically regarding the denial of violent events, we have taken enforcement action on numerous accounts that denied or shared misleading claims about violent actions and those affected during the war.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe value transparency in this work, and in the coming months we intend to release targeted datasets about the conflict to the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) for further analysis.\u00c2\u00a0\n5 April 2022\nIn the development and enforcement of our rules, we remain focused on enabling public conversation, and protecting the safety of people both online and offline. We are guided by international humanitarian law, specifically Article 13 of Geneva Convention III (on protecting prisoners of war (PoWs) from any physical or psychological abuse or threat thereof, and encompasses a prohibition on humiliating them) and do not want Twitter to be used by state actors to infringe this law. Our work to protect the conversation is informed by consultation with a wide range of trusted partners, including international human rights organizations, to ensure our approach considers the number of factors at play.\nTo that end, we will now ask government or state affiliated media accounts to remove any media published that features prisoners of war (PoW) under our private information and media policy. \nWe will also add a warning interstitial to media published by government or state affiliated media accounts featuring PoWs, that has a compelling public interest.\u00c2\u00a0\nLastly, we will now require the removal of any Tweets, regardless of who posts them, if there is PoW content shared with abusive intent, such as insults, calls for retaliation, mocking/taking pleasure in suffering of PoWs, or for any other behavior that violates the Twitter rules.\u00c2\u00a0 \n10 May 2022\nIn April, we announced that we would not amplify or recommend government accounts of states that limit access to free information and are engaged in armed interstate conflict, beginning with Russian government accounts. Our approach has proven effective \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for Russian government accounts, early results show that;\nEngagements per Tweet decreased by approximately 25%;\nThe number of accounts that engaged with those Tweets decreased by 49%.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long believed that content moderation should extend beyond the removal of content or accounts. Not amplifying \u00e2\u0080\u0093 meaning the content isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommended on Home Timelines and other surfaces \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and adding contextual labels quickly reduces content\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach and visibility on Twitter, at scale.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe consider a range of enforcement actions, and aim to ensure they're proportionate to the risk of harm created by the content. People's choices also influence how and what they see on Twitter; in this case, content from these accounts will still be shown to their followers, but won't be recommended to other people on Twitter.\nOur approach to monetization\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSince the week of February 21, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve paused advertising in Ukraine and Russia to ensure that critical public safety information is elevated, and that ads don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t detract from the conversation on Twitter.\nContent that discusses or focuses on the war, or that is considered false or misleading under the Twitter Rules, is not eligible for monetization. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also demonetized Search terms related to the war, preventing ads from appearing on the Search results pages for certain words. \nTaking a step back, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to keep in mind that since 2017 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve banned advertising from all accounts owned by Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik and donated the profits to NGOs working on digital literacy, misinformation, and election integrity. In 2019, we banned all state-backed news media advertising and political advertising. \nSupporting impacted communities \nWe continue to engage and support humanitarian organizations on the ground. Through our giving campaign for Twitter employees, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re routing donations to recognized organizations directly supporting Ukrainian refugees, matching all donations, and making direct contributions to partner organizations.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also providing high-value product donations and Ads for Good grants to help further these organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 critical work and amplify their message on Twitter. So far, these campaigns have made more than\u00c2\u00a0118,271,185 impressions*\u00c2\u00a0on Twitter. \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? \nAs the situation in Ukraine evolves, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to iterate on our approach, focusing on reducing potential harm and surfacing reliable information.

As of June 2022, Twitter Shops is now available to all merchants in the US. Last updated: August 1, 2022.\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching a beta experiment for the newest member of the Twitter Shopping family: Twitter Shops.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith Twitter Shops, merchants can handpick a collection of up to 50 products to showcase to shoppers on Twitter. The feature, which is free to use, gives people the chance to view products from the profiles of their favorite brands, so when you talk about and discover products on the timeline, you can now browse them on Twitter, too.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhen you go to the profile of a merchant that has Twitter Shops enabled, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see a \u00e2\u0080\u009cView shop\u00e2\u0080\u009d button just above their Tweets. When you tap the button, it will open up that merchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop, where you can scroll through items.

For now, people in the U.S. who use Twitter in English on iOS and Android devices will be able to view and interact with Twitter Shops.\nPeople are already talking about products on Twitter. We want Twitter Shops to be the home for merchants on Twitter where they can intentionally curate a catalog of products for their Twitter audience and build upon the product discussions already happening on our service by giving shoppers a point of action where a conversation can become a purchase.\nAs we continue to test, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore how to make Shops more discoverable; adding new ways for merchants to tell their brand story through their Shops; expanding the number of products merchants can showcase, and bringing Twitter Shops to more merchants and more people.\nStay tuned \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we look forward to making shopping easier than ever on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nbrands\ncommerce\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          \nNew conversation settings, coming to a Tweet near you\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 August 2020\n          \nNew labels for government and state-affiliated media accounts\n            \n            \n             Thursday, 6 August 2020\n          "}

By empowering people to do this together, they can add helpful and informative context for people from different points of view.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a slew of improvements to Birdwatch based on feedback from contributors, the public, and academic researchers, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing promising results. In surveys with randomly sampled people on Twitter in the US, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found:\nThe majority of people found Birdwatch notes (specifically those designated helpful by Birdwatch contributors) helpful. This includes people from across the political spectrum.\nPeople in the survey were 20-40% less likely to agree with the substance of a potentially misleading Tweet after reading a note about it, compared to those who saw a Tweet without a note.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThese are encouraging signs that Birdwatch can be helpful and informative to people on Twitter. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now expanding the visibility of the pilot so we can make additional improvements with feedback from more people on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nExpanding the visibility of Birdwatch\nStarting today, a small (and randomized) group of people on Twitter in the US will see Birdwatch notes directly on some Tweets. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be able to rate notes, providing input that will help improve Birdwatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to add context that is helpful to people from different points of view.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo appear on a Tweet, notes first need to be rated helpful by enough Birdwatch contributors from different perspectives. Difference in perspectives is determined by how people have rated notes in the past, not based on demographics. You can learn more about how we assess this\u00c2\u00a0here.\nHow we got here \nWhen we started a year ago, we set out to build Birdwatch in public, with input from people on Twitter, Birdwatch contributors, academic advisors, and researchers. We made all data contributed to Birdwatch publicly available, along with the code that uses that data to rank notes, and we continue to do so.\u00c2\u00a0\nFeedback and insights from the Twitter community has led to key improvements to Birdwatch:\nStrengthening the way Birdwatch identifies notes that a diverse set of people find helpful.\nDoing more to protect contributors and help them feel more comfortable contributing to Birdwatch by rolling out auto-generated aliases for everyone in the pilot.\nHelping participants understand the impact of their Birdwatch contributions by notifying them if their notes are rated helpful or if notes they rated are elevated.\nEncouraging participants to include sources and clear explanations in their notes with in-app prompt reminders.\nImproving the discoverability of notes that need a broader range of feedback by adding a personalized \u00e2\u0080\u0098Needs Your Help\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tab for pilot participants.\nWe recently announced a collaboration with the Associated Press and Reuters to help our teams assess the quality of information elevated by Birdwatch participants. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also onboarded an advisory board of scholars and researchers who study misinformation, polarization, online manipulation, and harassment. Advisors are from institutions including MIT, the University of Washington, the University of Michigan School of Information, and more.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs online misinformation continues to spread, addressing false or misleading narratives at scale warrants a multi-pronged approach. As a member of the Birdwatch advisory board, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve weighed in on its unique approach to explore a community-based tool for adding context to Tweets, including its ranking system to surface the most helpful pieces of context, and I look forward to seeing how this community grows.\nAmy Zhang\nProfessor, University of Washington \n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@amyxzh\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thankful for all 10,000 pilot contributors that have played a key role in making Birdwatch what it is today. Along with the time and effort they invest in writing and rating notes, Birdwatch contributors have consistently provided priceless feedback on their Birdwatch experience and shared thoughtful and honest feedback about what's working and what could be better.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to build in the open as we learn, iterate, and expand the pilot.

Meanwhile, as the number of fans continues to grow in various countries, Chile and Vietnam climbed the ranks by four and five positions, ultimately securing the 16th and 13th spots respectively.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOf course, the 21st century pop icon, BTS (@BTS_twt), takes the top spot as the most Tweeted about K-pop artist globally - with the band\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concert \u00e2\u0080\u0098BTS PERMISSION TO DANCE ON STAGE - LA\u00e2\u0080\u0099 alone contributing more than 68 million Tweets from all over the world. For the second year in a row, NCT (@NCTsmtown) comes in second.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition to K-pop sensation BLACKPINK (@BLACKPINK) and heavyweights EXO (@weareoneEXO) being featured on the top 20 list, younger groups also cemented their positions with TOMORROW X TOGETHER (@TXT_members) rising from 8th place in 2020 to 6th in 2021, ATEEZ (@ATEEZofficial) climbing one spot to 9th, and Stray Kids (@Stray_Kids) at 10th.\n2021 also proved to be a breakthrough year for the 4th generation of K-pop idols. ENHYPEN (@ENHYPEN_members) who were 5th on the 2020 list of rising K-pop artists impressively came in as the 3rd most Tweeted about band in 2021 (just after BTS and NCT). Within a year of their debut, the group celebrated a huge achievement with their first studio album \u00e2\u0080\u009cDIMENSION:DILEMMA\u00e2\u0080\u009d becoming a \u00e2\u0080\u0098million-seller\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and placing 11th on the Billboard 200 chart. Fellow 4th generation idols aespa (@aespa_official) and ITZY (@ITZYofficial) also hit significant milestones as they first entered the top 20 list, being 14th and 16th respectively.\nOther K-pop idols on the top 20 list include TREASURE (@treasuremembers), SEVENTEEN (@pledis_17), TWICE (@JYPETWICE), GOT7 (@GOT7Official), THE BOYZ (@IST_THEBOYZ), iKON (@YG_iKONIC), ASTRO (@offclASTRO), MonstaX (@OfficialMonstaX), Red Velvet (@RVsmtown), and SHINee(@SHINee).\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nUnsurprisingly ENHYPEN (@ENHYPEN_members) is first on the list of the Top 10 rising Artists, followed by TOMORROW X TOGETHER (@TXT_members), TREASURE (@treasuremembers), aespa (@aespa_official), and ITZY (@ITZYofficial). Newer generation groups like IVE (@IVEstarship), CRAVITY\u00c2\u00a0 (@CRAVITYstarship), WEi (@WEi__Official), ONEUS (@official_ONEUS), and CIX (@CIX_twt) are also featured on the Top 10.\n2021 saw growing global interest in Korean entertainment beyond music\nWhile the reach of K-pop continued to skyrocket, we also saw a variety of conversations as Korean dramas, movies, webtoons, and other types of entertainment steadily cemented their place on the world stage. In particular, webtoons turned K-dramas were embraced by the global audience, with True Beauty, Sweet Home, and Navillera among the top most Tweeted about webtoons on Twitter. Of course, the influence of K-pop also had a part to play. When official soundtracks included famous K-pop artists, dramas and webtoons enjoyed a boost in viewership - such as BTS V\u00e2\u0080\u0099s song \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sweet Night\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for Itaewon Class.\nAs the place to be for both fans and artists to connect, Twitter is a home for many celebrities from the different facets of Korean entertainment. In addition to well-known rapper Youngji (@dokgodieinsaeng) and actress Lee SeYoung (@seyoung0703), stars from the hit show Street Woman Fighter such as Monika (@monikaaashin), Honey J (@__honey_j__), and no:ze (@noze_world) started new Twitter accounts in the second half of 2021.\u00c2\u00a0\nFans enjoyed more #OnlyOnTwitter content connecting themselves closely to stars\nTwitter continues to launch new features and programs that deliver #OnlyOnTwitter content to fans everywhere. Beyond providing support to the K-pop community, Twitter is also expanding our capabilities and evolving into a service to promote K-content. We have already hosted #TwitterBlueroom live sessions for movies and dramas including Q&As with the cast of The Book of Fish, King Maker, The Red Sleeve, and One Ordinary Day. Twitter also brought #FanTweets and #BehindTheTweets to K-pop starting with BLACKPINK\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ROS\u00c3\u0089. With the introduction of Twitter Spaces in 2021, Twitter has also created more opportunities and channels for fans and artists to connect and communicate, building stronger relationships with each other.\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Head of Global K-pop Partnerships, YeonJeong Kim says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn 2021, with BTS and NCT leading the conversation, we could also see an increase in conversation related to rising artists such as ENHYPEN, aespa, and ITZY. But beyond K-pop, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen discussions about Korean content across the board on Twitter growing with K-pop fans talking about not just their favorite music, performances, concerts, and daily lives, but showing increasing interest in dramas and webtoons with K-pop soundtracks or starring K-pop idols. As the global consumption of Korean content grows, we look forward to seeing even more diverse conversations on Twitter and providing more content you can see #OnlyOnTwitter in 2022.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nmarketing\nmusic\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

Trust in information found online can be established and enhanced when companies, civil society and regulators are transparent about the data and processes they rely on. This, alongside thoughtful policies developed by governments around the world, can help elevate many of the core principles of the Open Internet. For our part, since 2012 we have consistently published bi-annual updates, detailing our enforcement actions housed in the Twitter Transparency Center.\u00c2\u00a0\nCoupled with this, we have been explicit in our advocacy for an Open Internet that is global, available to all, built on open standards and rooted in the protection of human rights. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said, protecting the Open Internet \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which continues to be under threat \u00e2\u0080\u0094 requires meaningful transparency, which is essential to holding companies and governments to account. This work is core to who we are as a company \u00e2\u0080\u0093 connecting back to the very first Twitter Transparency Report in 2012, one of the first such reports in the industry.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re facing unprecedented challenges as governments around the world increasingly attempt to intervene and remove content. This threat to privacy and freedom of expression is a deeply worrying trend that requires our full attention. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s update to the Twitter Transparency Center highlights our long-standing commitment to meaningful transparency and the pressing, urgent need to defend the free, secure, and global Open Internet. \nSin\u00c3\u00a9ad McSweeney\nVP of Global Public Policy and Philanthropy\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@smcs\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nToday, we continue to build on our commitment to sharing meaningful insights about the work we do through the publication of the latest update to our Twitter Transparency Center, including relevant data from January 1, 2021, through June 30, 2021.\nInformation and removal requests\u00c2\u00a0\nAs important regulatory discussions take place across the globe, we believe it is crucial for citizens to be aware of the requests made by their governments. Throughout this reporting period, Twitter continued to receive requests from governments for account information and account preservations.\nGovernment preservation requests (requests to preserve account information) decreased by 4% from our most recent publication, with the United States accounting for 57% of all global preservation requests.\nIn a change from our last reporting period, the United States became the single largest source of government information requests with 3,026 requests, accounting for 24% of the global volume we received during this period. These requests accounted for 27% of all accounts specified from around the world and Twitter complied, in whole or in part, with 68% of these U.S. information requests.\nTwitter partially disclosed or did not disclose information in response to 64% of global government information requests, a decrease of 9% during this reporting period, under our guidelines for requesting information.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs of this reporting period, Twitter has now received non-government information requests from 35 different countries since 2014, including Argentina, Israel, and Switzerland, which appeared in this report for the first time. These requests come from third parties seeking account information from Twitter, for example, as non-parties in a civil action, or on behalf of defendants in criminal cases.\u00c2\u00a0\nJapan, Brazil, and the United States were the top three requesting countries when it comes to non-government requests, with all three accounting for 89% of all requests and 87% of the total accounts specified for this period.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn terms of legal demands from governments, in the six month period covered in this report, Twitter received 43,387 legal demands to remove content, specifying 196,878 accounts. This is the largest number of accounts ever subject to removal requests in a reporting period since releasing our first transparency report in 2012.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOf the total global volume of legal demands, 95% originated from only five countries (in decreasing order): Japan, Russia, Turkey, India, and South Korea. We withheld or required account holders to remove some or all of the reported content in response to 54% of these global legal demands.\nEnforcement of the Twitter Rules\nTwitter required account holders to remove 4.7M Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules. Of the Tweets removed, 68% received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 24% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. In total, impressions on these violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all Tweets during that time period.\nIn these six months, Twitter permanently suspended 453,754 unique accounts for violations of our child sexual exploitation (CSE) policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 89% of those accounts were proactively identified and removed by deploying a range of internal tools and/or by utilizing the industry hash sharing (e.g., PhotoDNA) prior to any reports filed via the designated CSE reporting channel.\nIn the first half of 2021, Twitter suspended 44,974 unique accounts for promotion of terrorism and violent organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 93% of those accounts were proactively identified and removed.\nBroadly, Twitter continues to see an overall downward trend in the number of violating accounts which is likely due to changing behaviors of these actors coupled with continued improvements of our defenses in this area.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs the Open Internet continues to be under threat around the world, we will continue our advocacy and build on our work to increase meaningful transparency and accountability in the industry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with the Twitter Transparency Center as our single source of truth in this space.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo track this work, follow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for year-round updates.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

As part of this mission, we have a zero tolerance approach to combating child sexual exploitation (CSE) on our service. Any content that features or promotes child sexual exploitation (CSE) is prohibited on Twitter. This may include media, text, illustrated, or computer-generated images. Regardless of the intent, viewing, sharing, or linking to child sexual exploitation material contributes to the re-victimisation of the depicted children. This also applies to content that may further contribute to victimisation of children through the promotion or glorification of child sexual exploitation.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are actively working to protect children around the world from CSE. We are achieving this via advancing technology solutions, intensive training and support to law enforcement, and expanded education and partnerships.\nWe use a combination of machine learning and human review \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our systems are able to surface content to human moderators who use important context to make decisions about potential rule violations. This work is led by an international, cross-functional team with 24-hour coverage and the ability to cover multiple languages.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen we are made aware of CSE media, including links to images of or content promoting child exploitation, the material will be removed from the site without further notice and immediately reported to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (\"NCMEC\"). The latter makes reports available to the appropriate law enforcement agencies around the world to facilitate investigations and prosecutions. NCMEC has strong relationships with law enforcement authorities and NGOs worldwide as well as with the INHOPE network.\nWe also have an appeal process for any potential errors that could occur.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor further information on our approach please visit this\u00c2\u00a0page and our Transparency Center.\n---\n(1) the type and volumes of data processed;\u00c2\u00a0\nDuring this reporting period Twitter suspended 532,898 accounts for violating our CSE policy. At this time, Twitter does not track the accounts which are reviewed and not actioned for any policy violations. However,\u00c2\u00a0 Twitter may review personal information, including account information, text, and media to investigate possible violations of our CSE policy.\u00c2\u00a0\n(2) the specific ground relied on for the processing pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679;\u00c2\u00a0\nInformation regarding the grounds for processing relied upon by Twitter are available in our Privacy Policy and our Data Processing materials.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n(3) the ground relied on for transfers of personal data outside the Union pursuant to Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, where applicable;\u00c2\u00a0\nAs outlined in our Privacy Policy, Twitter relies on Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers.\n(4) the number of cases of online child sexual abuse identified, differentiating between online child sexual abuse material and solicitation of children;\nBoth types of actions violate Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CSE Policy, but at this time we are unable to distinguish between online sexual abuse material and the specific context of each peice of material, such as the solicitation of children. However, during this reporting period we suspended 532,898 accounts for violating our CSE Policy.\n(8) the retention policy and the data protection safeguards applied pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/679;\u00c2\u00a0\nThe relevant retention periods for data Twitter collects are outlined in our Privacy Policy.

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we regularly collaborate with trusted partners on our Trust and Safety Council\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0develop products and programs, and to improve the Twitter Rules.\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing a recap of some of the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve accomplished hand-in-hand with these trusted partners, as well as more about our ongoing commitment to incorporating the expertise of global experts, researchers, and developers to support healthy public conversation on Twitter.\nIncorporating feedback to make Twitter safer\nWe know the best version of Twitter is the one built by the people who use it. Over the past year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve engaged with the Trust and Safety Council on thirteen projects early in the development process. We distilled and put to use their feedback on ways we can offer a better and safer experience for people using Twitter. Their feedback directly informed our approach on several products.\nCommunities: We incorporated feedback on the need to manage expectations on the role that moderators play by limiting the number of responsibilities and building tools to help them manage potential harassment.\nTips: We incorporated feedback on the need to emphasize that the people on our service are responsible for transactions in a user-friendly way by asking people to agree to terms of service when enabling the feature.\nSafety Mode: To mitigate the effect on limiting counter-speech, a concern raised by the council particularly for people in positions of power, we decided to automatically time out interventions for seven days.\nConversation settings: We started testing a notification that reminds people they can change who can reply to their Tweets to increase awareness and adoption as a direct recommendation from the council.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter has become an extremely important communication tool in India, and it is encouraging to see Twitter take active interest and respond to the feedback given by council members. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to be part of a team of trusted partners which gets heard and is able to make Twitter a safer platform for all, especially women.\nCentre for Social Research\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@CSR_India\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nAs a founding member of the Trust and Safety Council, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked alongside Twitter to help influence positive change for over a decade. We believe that everyone should benefit from technology free from abuse and harassment and bring this perspective to all council meetings. We look forward to continued collaboration with Twitter to ensure that matters raised by our organization and the people we support are integrated into Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products and policies.\n SWGfL\nUK Safer Internet Centre partner\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@SWGfL_Official\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nTransparency is core to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach. Through initiatives such as our open developer platform, our information operations archive, and our disclosures in the Twitter Transparency Center and Lumen, we continue to support third-party research of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on Twitter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to build on these efforts and inform the public as we improve Twitter in the open. The following are highlights from the past year.\nTwitter API for Academic Research: In early 2021, we launched a dedicated Academic Research product track on the new Twitter API giving qualified researchers access to the entire history of public conversation and elevated access to real-time data for free.\u00c2\u00a0\nAlgorithmic bias bounty challenge: When we introduced our commitment to responsible machine learning, we also said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe journey to responsible, responsive, and community-driven machine learning systems is a collaborative one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we introduced the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first algorithmic bias bounty competition to draw on the global ethical AI community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of the unintended harms of saliency algorithms to expand our own understanding and to reward the people doing work in this field.\nTwitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC): We announced the creation of a new global expert group\u00c2\u00a0 of academics, members of civil societies and NGOs, and journalists to study platform governance issues. We look forward to deeper analysis from this range of global experts and expect the collaboration to result in expanded disclosures beyond information operations to include sharing data in areas like misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nLaunch of an API curriculum:\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cGetting started with the Twitter API for Academic Research\u00e2\u0080\u009d is now being used at universities, enabling students and teachers to learn how to use Twitter data for academic research. It is currently starred by over 200 academics on Github.\u00c2\u00a0\nCreation of a Developer Platform Academic Research advisory board: This group of 12 scholars began work with our team this year to better understand how we can enhance the use of the Twitter API for academic research, while increasing meaningful dialogue between the Twitter Academic program and the academic community.\nDeveloper research highlights: We published and continued to spotlight key research areas Twitter teams are working on today in an effort to inspire even more researchers to pursue these topics.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? Increasing transparency and understanding on our approach to content moderation\nAs we continue to invite trusted partners and the public to share feedback on ways to make Twitter safe, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be transparent about how we develop and enforce the Twitter Rules. Our newly formed Content Governance Initiative (CGI) aims to do this by developing a governance framework that provides a consistent and principled approach to the development, enforcement, and assessment of our global rules and policies. To build our governance framework, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re engaging external stakeholders and have created an additional advisory group on our Trust and Safety Council. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue collaborating with this group and cross-functional teams across Twitter to establish standardized guidelines on policy development, enforcement, and appeals that help drive a common understanding of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to content moderation. The framework's principles and guidelines will aim to fulfill the following objectives:\nBuild legitimacy and trust through transparency and accountability.\nDeepen our commitment to good governance and human rights.\nProvide additional clarity on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content moderation processes.\nAffirm our commitment to serving a diverse and inclusive global community.\nWe recognize that achieving these objectives will not be easy. Content moderation at scale is a highly complex and challenging process.

In my 2020 year in review I spoke about how necessity had yet again proved to be the mother of invention, with pandemic related lockdowns accelerating the use of underutilized data sources, such as social, to understand consumer opinion and sentiment in real time. And as organizations quickly saw the value in these new sources of insight, it was hard to imagine them going back to the slower, more costly data and opinion gathering techniques of the past.\nThis year has proven that to be correct, and with customer experience and customer centricity now all the rage, social data is proving its worth by surfacing the real voice of the customer in real time. Combine this with the push to democratize insight and integrate these customer voices across the organization, and I believe we are now at a tipping point in the use of social intelligence. In my conversations with dozens of brands over the past year, five main themes stood out to me: \n1. The great consolidation \nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve probably heard about \"the great resignation\" but in the world of social intelligence, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"the great consolidation\" that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top of mind. Spurred on by pandemic lockdowns and restrictions, organizations took to digital transformation with gusto, accelerating the digitization of their customer interactions and internal operations by three to four years according to a 2020 McKinsey study. And, for many, a key step in that transformation journey was to address an unwieldy and duplicative social marketing and customer experience (CX) tech stack. I observed countless organizations turning to social suites, who could offer the core capabilities of content publishing, customer care and listening, as well as many secondary features such as advocacy, content management and influencer marketing to name a few.\nBrands also realized they didn't need a dozen different social listening providers, prompting them to consolidate down to one or opt for a social suite to deliver everything. They also started to ask tougher questions of prospective vendors about the quality of their AI, in some cases manually auditing the vendors' annotations with human ones to compare accuracy.\u00c2\u00a0 \n2. The strategic acquisition \nAs buyers were busy consolidating their social media tools, vendors from a variety of diverse backgrounds sought to broaden and strengthen their offerings by acquiring social capabilities. These acquisitions took several forms. First, the merger of traditional media monitoring with social media monitoring continued with Cision's acquisition of Brandwatch, Meltwater's purchase of Linkfluence and Access Intelligence's (Pulsar) merger with Isentia. Secondly, a great many acquisitions fell under the CX umbrella. This included the customer feedback and voice of the customer vendors adding social expertise such as Qualtrics's acquisition of Clarabridge and Reputation's purchase of Nuvi. It also included customer care and engagement vendors adding social capabilities to improve their core offering such as Verint's pickup of Conversocial, Hootsuite's acquisitions of Sparkcentral and Heyday, and Khoros\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purchase of Topbox. We also witnessed a huge IPO, with Sprinklr taking their \u00e2\u0080\u0098Unified CXM Platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099 public.\u00c2\u00a0\nAll of these moves suggest a vendor landscape beginning to coalesce around three main categories: Communications Clouds, CX Clouds and Insights Clouds. Key to the success of them all has been the integration of social data into their solutions and the ability to blend it with other data sources providing a more\u00c2\u00a0comprehensive picture. Which brings me to... \n3. The death of the social silo \nSome time ago, social listening vendors began to reframe themselves as 'consumer intelligence platforms,' offering clients the ability to combine social data with other digital sources such as surveys and first-party data. This seemed a natural progression as these tools could already analyze unstructured social posts, so why not apply that to other unstructured data sources and provide brands with a more complete view of consumers. When Forrester released their New Wave on AI-Enabled Consumer Intelligence Platforms in July, it seemed that the era of social listening as a category was coming to an end. And to hammer home the point, just a few months later Zendesk announced its acquisition of Momentive (formerly SurveyMonkey) with the goal of creating a \"powerful new customer intelligence company.\" This combination of CX or behavioral data with solicited and unsolicited feedback seems to be the future of the consumer insights world and would suggest more 'Insights Clouds' are on the horizon.\n4. The growth of social intelligence as a profession and the dearth of talent \nWhile social listening as a category continues to fade, social intelligence is just getting started. A LinkedIn search finds 15,000 people globally mentioning social intelligence in their profile while another 22,000 mention social media data. And, this phenomenon is not exclusive to those working in agency land or for technology suppliers, but within brands themselves who have been actively recruiting to bring talent in-house.\nThe challenge is in finding people with the right skills and experience to fill these vacancies. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard many times that this dearth of talent is one reason why specialist research agencies have never been busier. Jeremy Hollow, Founder & MD of Listen + Learn Research, a social data insights agency, commented, \"The market seems to be expanding and maturing, with more of the routine analytical work being brought in-house while agencies are being used to bring deeper strategic insights.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n5. The evolution of market research from question-based to observational approaches \nMarket research, specifically research tech, is in the midst of an investment frenzy with numerous SaaS upstarts raising funds to disrupt various parts of the research supply chain. In my view, a great many are simply automating manual processes (survey creation, sample access, etc.) while a few are fundamentally challenging the question-based approach to primary research and how we understand consumer needs.\nThey are looking instead to the billions of online conversations on every imaginable subject to collect organic consumer opinions and predict future trends. This data science led approach is allowing insight professionals the ability to analyze huge amounts of unstructured social commentary, providing qualitative insights on a quantitative scale. And it seems that this is a key priority of research buyers as well. A recent GreenBook Report found that the analysis of social media data was their number one area of focus when it came to the adoption of automation. \nOnwards to 2022 \nThese themes suggest that social intelligence has truly come into its own over the past year with numerous trends conspiring to drive awareness and adoption. Despite that, many organizations still consider social data a marketing-specific resource and undervalue its business impact. Sprout Social\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent Index survey highlighted this very point, reporting that 46% of respondents saw social data strictly as a marketing resource. Clearly, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still work to be done and people to win over, however this shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take away from the 54% who saw social data in a more strategic light. And after such a challenging year, why not see the glass as half full?\nInterested to learn more about how Twitter and our partners can support your social intelligence journey?

Countries are pulling at the threads of the DSM \u00e2\u0080\u0093 such as the Country of Origin Principle \u00e2\u0080\u0093 without fully appreciating the damage they might cause to Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital ecosystem. Small-to-medium size tech companies, including homegrown enterprises, are asking the EU to preserve the regulatory frameworks that underpin their existence.\u00c2\u00a0\nAutomattic, Jodel, Seznam, Twitter and Vimeo are today building on their joint advocacy over the past year (letter, June 2021) with a DSA Holiday Wish List. We seek to encourage fair and progressive regulation, both in Europe and globally, that works for companies and countries of all sizes.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our 2022 wish list for the DSA:\nA harmonised definition and enforcement framework across Member States for \u00e2\u0080\u0098illegal content\u00e2\u0080\u0099. This avoids excessive takedowns or conflicting rules that will build digital borders.\nA strong Country of Origin principle that supports a diverse online marketplace. Without it, we risk entrenching the largest players, reducing consumer choice and irreparably splintering the Digital Single Market. At least ten Member States have submitted positions that align with our view \u00e2\u0080\u0093 highlighting the shared interests between smaller companies and smaller countries.\nNo general monitoring obligations or stay-down provisions. If you really mean it, don't include it.\u00c2\u00a0\nA clear and harmonised notice and action mechanism in Article 14. This removes legal uncertainty, duplication, conflict and demonstrates a commitment to a coherent content regime for the EU.\u00c2\u00a0\nNo more removal timelines. With conflicting definitions of illegal content, this approach does not do justice to the complexity and context of user expression and would incentivise a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdelete first\u00e2\u0080\u009d approach.\nRemove law enforcement back doors in Article 15a. Ensure transparent and rigorous judicial processes are firmly established with respect to content takedown and user data requests from law enforcement.\u00c2\u00a0\nGatekeepers / Very Large Online Platform (VLOP) Criteria Alignment. The criteria for defining \u00e2\u0080\u009cGatekeepers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and VLOPs should be aligned across the Digital Markets Act Article 3 and the DSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Article 25. These criteria should reflect the commercial reality of the sector, as shown here.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nRecognise that search engines are often different to social or commercial platforms. The obligations put on search engines, particularly those not in the VLOP category of services, should be carefully considered and must be feasible and scalable. European search start-ups, such as Seznam, could easily be hurt.\u00c2\u00a0\nSigned;\n@automattic,@jodelapp, @seznam_cz, @Twitter and @Vimeo\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFirst Letter: Crossroads for the Open Internet, December 2020\nSecond letter: Digital Services Act: Defending the Open Internet\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npolicy\nprivacy\nproduct\ntechnology\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

The second place Tweet features a selfie from BTS' JungKook with a simple kissing face emoji caption.

{"date": "Thursday, 2 December 2021", "title": " Expanding access beyond information operations ", "topic": "Company", "author": "Yoel Roth", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/-expanding-access-beyond-information-operations-", "post_text": "Company\n Expanding access beyond information operations \n            By\n            \n  \n  \n          \n            and\n            \n  \n  \nThursday, 2 December 2021\nLink copied successfully\nEditorial note: This blog was first published on 2 December 2021 and last updated 24 August 2022 to include updates to our approach.\nIn October 2018, we published the first comprehensive, public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Since then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared 37 datasets of attributed platform manipulation campaigns originating from 17 countries, spanning more than 200 million Tweets and nine terabytes of media. More than 26,000 researchers have accessed these datasets, empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.\nWe strive to provide timely updates, alongside comprehensive data, whenever our teams identify and remove these campaigns, however, this year, due to technical issues and significant risks to the physical safety of our employees posed by certain disclosures, we have only provided one update. During this time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to identify a sustainable path forward, without compromising on our goals of providing meaningful transparency.\nToday, in addition to disclosing eight additional datasets in our archive, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing an update on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned from these efforts and how we intend to advance data-driven transparency in 2022 and beyond.\nWhat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned so far\nMeaningful transparency begins with access to data. The data we publish about information operations allows researchers to understand not just that a platform manipulation campaign took place and that Twitter removed it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but precisely which narratives that campaign aimed to advance, and how widely they spread on Twitter. Access to raw content, rather than limited samples and aggregate information, is important.\nRaw data isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accessible to everyone. Many of the datasets we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released include hundreds of thousands of Tweets and gigabytes of media. Processing this information often requires advanced tooling and capabilities. Academics, independent researchers, NGOs and data journalists play a key part in translating raw data into meaningful insights, as well as providing critical context in understanding how bad actors operate. Partnerships with the Stanford Internet Observatory and Australia Strategic Policy Institute have helped put these datasets in analytic and narrative context, along with a conference dedicated to studying this data we held in conjunction with the Carnegie Institute.\nConfident attribution isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always possible. Our transparency approach has focused on activity we can confidently attribute to a state actor. Emergent behaviors, including the use of disinformation-for-hire vendors and increasing operational security, sometimes make confident attribution impossible based solely on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own data. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the activity in question less important to analyze, but our policies presently prevent dataset disclosure in these cases. Moreover, access to this data, without attribution, may allow experts to piece together operations across multiple platforms and services that is not possible by just one company.\nInformation operations are just one area of public concern. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided an unprecedented level of transparency about state-backed information operations, given their severe impact on public discourse around the world. As Camille Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois and evelyn douek have pointed out, other content moderation domains of equal public concern don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive the same treatment.\nWhere we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re headed in 2022\nWith these lessons in mind, as well as the emergent risks we see to the physical safety of our employees around the world tied to potential disclosures, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re changing our approach in an effort to continue to provide expanded transparency about our content moderation actions. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in the coming months:\nIn early 2022, we will launch the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a global group of experts from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism studying platform governance issues.\nMembership in the consortium will be granted to groups or individuals with:\n- A proven track record of research on content moderation and integrity topics (or affiliation with a group that does such research, such as a university, research lab, or newspaper).\n- Appropriate plans and systems for safeguarding the privacy and security of the data provided by the consortium.\nWe will be fully public about the standards used to determine membership in the consortium, and will bias towards inclusion and access, particularly for emerging researchers and researchers from historically under-represented communities and parts of the world.\nTwitter will not exercise any control or judgment over the findings or focus areas of the research produced using this data by members of the consortium.\nThe more than 200 researchers around the world with existing access to our unhashed information operations datasets will be invited to join the consortium through an expedited process. Other qualifying individuals and institutions are welcome to apply. We will share additional details about this process in early 2022 in advance of any disclosures to the consortium.\nWe will provide comprehensive data about attributed platform manipulation campaigns to members of the consortium, who may independently choose to publish their findings on the basis of the data we share and their own research. Under this model, we will also begin to share data about platform manipulation campaigns for which we have not been able to arrive at confident attribution to a state actor, and campaigns where we are unable to provide broad access due to employee safety concerns.\nLater in 2022, we will for the first time share similarly comprehensive data about other policy areas, including misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs part of this change, we will discontinue our fully public dataset releases, prioritizing release to the consortium. Existing datasets will continue to be available for download indefinitely \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and our public data offerings, including free access to our APIs (including the full archive of Tweets) remain available. \nOur efforts in this space are underpinned by our Privacy Policy which has long informed people how we may use the data they share with us. This includes sharing or disclosing information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services. As we highlighted in our position paper setting out principles for policymakers drafting new regulations, we urge policymakers to build protections for this kind of data sharing into the laws that govern data privacy. \nTransparency is core to our mission. Our goal with these changes is to provide more transparency about more issues, while grappling with the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges in this space. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to learn and iterate on our approach over time and share those findings publicly along the way. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n7 June 2022\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re opening up the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium to a limited group of researchers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use this initial period to gather learnings and make adjustments to program design, where needed, ahead of our forthcoming public launch. Feedback from these researchers will help shape and inform our work.\u00c2\u00a0\nDuring this period, membership will be open to applicants who were granted access to our information operation data sets during prior disclosures. Researchers with prior access may re-apply for the Consortium during this phase, and will be evaluated in line with the below updated criteria:\nHold a primary institutional affiliation with an academic, journalistic, nonprofit, or civil society research organization. If they are students, they must be master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or PhD level students; undergraduate students are ineligible at this time.\nHave prior experience and relevant skills for data-driven analysis. Consortium datasets are primarily shared as JSON files and require technical skills to analyze.\u00c2\u00a0\nDemonstrate a specific public interest research use case for the data provided by the Consortium. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cPublic interest research use case\u00e2\u0080\u009d means non-commercial research for journalistic, academic, or non-profit/civil society purposes.)\nEquipped with industry-standard plans and systems for safeguarding the privacy and security of the data provided by the Consortium. Consortium members are required to sign a data use agreement.\nLater this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open up the application for Consortium membership to the wider public and share key learnings from the beta period.\nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said previously, transparency is core to our work here. Through this updated approach, we aim to share more about what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on the Twitter service, while addressing the safety, security, and integrity challenges that accompany these disclosures. Down the line, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll disclose data about other policy areas, including misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety. More to come.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n24 August 2022\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing an update on our Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) program. In the coming days, our TMRC global partners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and Cazadores de Fake News \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will publish independent research about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest information operation data sets. These 15 data sets include platform manipulation campaigns originating from the Americas, Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (EMEA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).\u00c2\u00a0\nAs we noted last year (above), we will now prioritize sharing information operations data with the Consortium. While we continue to share data with researchers about the networks we remove \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Twitter's assessment of the presumptive country of origin, based on the technical signals that we observe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will no longer provide specific attribution information. Meaning, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t publicly disclose whether an information operation was carried out by a specific state actor, or other actor.\nOur goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter, while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. Information operations are also increasingly hard to attribute to specific actors \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 this change allows us to disclose data from a broader set of coordinated campaigns. Further, this change will allow researchers to piece together operations across multiple platforms and services, beyond what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible with just one platform. \nWe continue to draw learnings from the initial early access period. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on developing a global group of Consortium members, and to date, have accepted applications from researchers around the world. Later this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open the TMRC application process to a broader group of researchers.\u00c2\u00a0 \nDown the line, we intend to share data about a wider range of Safety and Integrity policy areas. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

The account sets include eight distinct operations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve attributed to six countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mexico, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, Tanzania, Uganda, and Venezuela, respectively. Every account and piece of content associated with these operations has been permanently removed from the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition, we have shared relevant data from this disclosure with three leading research partners: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), Cazadores de Fake News, and the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO). In most instances, accounts were suspended for various violations of our platform manipulation and spam policies. See more via our Transparency Center.  Below, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined information about our latest disclosure. In the future, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share key insights with the public, and more comprehensive data will be shared with our global consortium.

Together with Twitter, we hope to move societies from commitment to action by widening access to authoritative information, encouraging dialogue and shaping public discourse towards creating healthy and inclusive societies.\nMahesh Mahalingam\nDirector, Communications and Global Advocacy, UNAIDS\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to protecting the health of the public conversation on Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ensuring individuals can find credible information from authoritative sources is a key part of that mission. We also recognized that it is crucial for the public to have access to a free and #OpenInternet in combating the stigma around HIV. Therefore, we are partnering with public health authorities and local nonprofit organizations across Asia Pacific and the Americas to provide people with access to accurate information about HIV via launching a dedicated #ThereisHelp notification prompt for HIV.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHIV stigma during COVID-19 HIV remains a major issue to public health in 2021, despite significant progress having been made in recent decades. Division and disparity for human rights have long been the contributing factors to the difficulty faced by people living with HIV. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult by exacerbating inequities and disruptions to services related to HIV. In 2020, around 800,000 children aged 0-14 years were living with HIV with no access to HIV treatments.\nThis year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme of World AIDS Day is \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnd inequalities. End AIDS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a special focus on highlighting the growing inequalities in access to essential HIV services.\u00c2\u00a0WHO is calling on global leaders and citizens to rally to confront the inequalities that drive AIDS and to reach people who are currently not receiving essential HIV services.\nData from Twitter shows that conversations about HIV spikes around\u00c2\u00a0#WorldAIDSDay on December 1 every year. In 2020, there were close to 9 million Tweets about HIV globally, out of which over 1 million Tweets were generated in December 2020.\nAt Twitter, we recognize our role and responsibility to help ensure that people can access and receive support on our service when they need it the most. The various communities on Twitter are a source of positive support and are thriving; encouraging each other who may be struggling with stigma or lack of information around HIV, and to reach out for professional help.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nUnited to help provide more access to information  We recognize that access to a free and\u00c2\u00a0#OpenInternet\u00c2\u00a0and collaboration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 public, private and community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the key to combating the stigma around HIV. As local organizations continue to use Twitter as a channel to identify and reach out to vulnerable people who they may otherwise not have contact with, and to raise awareness of their important services; we hope that the #ThereIsHelp notification service will complement these efforts.\nBelow are our trusted NGO and government partners in this initiative that have made the #ThereIsHelp HIV notification prompt possible in 30 markets and in 12 languages.

I recently spoke with her about the evolution of social intelligence within organizations and what the most successful ones are getting right.\nJoe: To start, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your favorite Twitter follow? Jillian: Generally, I love following Scottish Twitter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very funny! My favourite account is Daily Overview (@DOverview) where you view the world looking down from the sky. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful.\nJoe: Tell us about the history of The SILab and where the idea came from? Jillian: All of this started off as a passion project for me. I was in Scotland doing my PhD on social media and looking to connect with others with an interest in the space.\u00c2\u00a0 This was 2018 and I found that people in the research and insights industry didn't understand it properly and treated social insights with a bit of skepticism. But I kept looking and interestingly enough, I found that there was quite a community of practitioners out there, but they weren't connected.\u00c2\u00a0 So, the whole premise of the Social Intelligence Lab was to bring these people together to further our knowledge of this emerging source of insight. Key to this was it being driven by the practitioners themselves and not the vendors who would have their own agenda.\nJoe: We first met in the autumn of 2018 at your conference which was probably the first dedicated to this idea of social intelligence. Has it since matured and spread as much as you had hoped? Jillian: The idea that organizations need to be aware of signals from social media data is quite mainstream these days, however in many cases it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true social intelligence but rather a narrower focus on using social data to better optimize your social media marketing strategy. This is a legitimate use case of course, but it misses out on the value social data brings to making better decisions across the organization. If you are not doing that, and just tracking mentions, then you are just doing social listening.\nJoe: What is your definition of social intelligence by the way? Jillian: Social intelligence is the analysis of digital conversations to answer questions, test hypotheses or find insights that can be used to guide decision making. It has recently morphed into consumer intelligence or digital consumer intelligence, which I would say is an effort by the tech companies to differentiate their products as they begin to explore a wider variety of data sources rather than being a whole new discipline. Most practitioners would typically use these data sources anyway. If you Google \u00e2\u0080\u0098social intelligence\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you'll get a lot of links to do with emotional intelligence, which is quite interesting to me because I think they're very similar. A real strength of social data is the ability to understand people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authentic emotions on a topic.\nJoe: Covid and the ensuing lockdowns were a big shock to the consumer insights industry forcing many to pivot their opinion gathering techniques. Do you think this experience has opened the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes to the value of social insights? Jillian: I think it has, but the bigger issue is the ability to get the work done successfully. I know of several brands that went out and procured new solutions to help them gather social insights but once they had them, realized they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use them because they lacked the expertise to get value from these solutions. This highlights the skills gap that exists and probably also highlights why the specialist social intelligence agencies are doing so well: brands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this analysis work themselves and are having to outsource it. All the specialist agencies we work with have reported dramatic increases in their work and are hiring staff to keep up.\nJoe: Can you talk more about the skills gap you mentioned? Jillian: Social listening solutions are often billed as DIY insight tools with this idea that you can give it to anybody in the organization, train them up and off they go. This democratization of social data certainly sounds great in theory, but we know from the more mature, advanced organizations that this approach of onboarding half the company on a tool doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, and what you need to democratize instead is the insights. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it's time consuming to cleanse and segment data and interpret the findings in a meaningful way. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly not for a novice to do or someone who is only logging-in once a week to take a quick look at a dashboard.\nJoe: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re therefore arguing for a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Centre of Excellence\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that can feed different parts of the organization with social insights tailored to their specific needs? Jillian: Yes, definitely. We are seeing many enterprise organizations building out listening teams or social intelligence teams that often are part of the org\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader insights function. Their job is to embed themselves into specific business units or departments delivering social insights to those teams and educating them on the kinds of problems or questions that social data can answer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one part delivery and another part education.\nJoe: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a best practice for getting this set up? Jillian: Many organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success has started with their senior leadership promoting the importance of not just social intelligence, but data driven decision making, of which social data is one part. Your interview with Adam Mills highlighting British Telecom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey is a great example. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also say that a vast majority of the time, when an organization is investing in social data heavily, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because social insights helped them come through some sort of crisis where it provided a real-time pulse of what was happening that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anywhere else. Utilizing this type of experience to your advantage is important. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen organizations grow internal adoption by sending daily briefings customized to specific departments and personas. This makes it more tangible, and people get interested.\nJoe: You mentioned that more and more organizations are seeing the value in insights from social data. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keeping it from being used more consistently in market research? Jillian: I think a big part of it is in the data access models available to market researchers. Most of the social listening solutions have historically required a year-long contract which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always fit well with the episodic, project-based world of market researchers who may only need access for a few weeks at a time. More flexible consumption models would certainly make it easier for them to access the data they need. Another challenge is that most of the solutions haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been built with market researchers in mind. They [market researchers] tend to want to get the data out of the solution so they can create their own code frames and segmentations and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not particularly easy. I do see it improving however as the listening solutions see a huge growth opportunity in market research.\nJoe: On that point of technology, text and image analytics have come a long way in just the past few years. Are these advances the missing link allowing new personas to unlock more insight across new use cases? Jillian: There has been technological development in the area, but it is not the technology that unlocks the value. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in a place yet where having the technology is going to be the missing link and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that we should never sell social intelligence in this way. Businesses need to invest in skills, the experts with social insight experience. It is these people who are going to unlock more insight and use cases across the organization. We need to identify the use cases and questions where social data can support the business, not be led by new functionality in technology to tell us what we should be doing. If we look at image analysis, there is huge potential for insights here but if you speak to a semiotician they would say the tech does not help them gain insights from the data easily. I think this is the main reason organizations are struggling to make visual listening work for them, as just one example.\nJoe: Final question then...what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superpower? Jillian: In wider society, it's the surfacing of cultural trends, meaning what big trends are becoming important. Your cultural trends report is always a good read. At a brand level, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer experience - instead of looking at cx data at the individual level, go macro and you can learn a lot.\nJoe: Many thanks for your time today, Jillian!\n\u00c2\u00a0\nInterested to learn more about how Twitter and our partners can support your social intelligence journey?

Learn more about reporting on Twitter.\nSharing private media\u00c2\u00a0 When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it. This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.\nHowever, if the purpose of the dissemination of private images of public figures or individuals who are part of public conversations is to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence them, we may remove the content in line with our policy against abusive behavior.. Similarly, private nude images of public individuals will continue to be actioned under our non-consensual nudity policy.\nWe recognize that there are instances where account holders may share images or videos of private individuals in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, such as in the aftermath of a violent event, or as part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value, and this might outweigh the safety risks to a person. \nWe will always try to assess the context in which the content is shared and, in such cases, we may allow the images or videos to remain on the service. For instance, we would take into consideration whether the\u00c2\u00a0 image is publicly available and/or is being covered by mainstream/traditional media (newspapers, TV channels, online news sites), or if a particular image and the accompanying tweet text adds value to the public discourse, is being shared in public interest, or is relevant to the community.\nFeeling safe on Twitter is different for everyone, and our teams are constantly working to understand and address these needs.

{"date": "Thursday, 2 December 2021", "title": " Expanding access beyond information operations ", "topic": "Company", "author": "Yoel Roth", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/-expanding-access-beyond-information-operations-", "post_text": "Company\n Expanding access beyond information operations \n            By\n            \n  \n  \n          \n            and\n            \n  \n  \nThursday, 2 December 2021\nLink copied successfully\nEditorial note: This blog was first published on 2 December 2021 and last updated 24 August 2022 to include updates to our approach.\nIn October 2018, we published the first comprehensive, public archive of data related to state-backed information operations. Since then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shared 37 datasets of attributed platform manipulation campaigns originating from 17 countries, spanning more than 200 million Tweets and nine terabytes of media. More than 26,000 researchers have accessed these datasets, empowering an unprecedented level of empirical research into state-backed attacks on the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.\nWe strive to provide timely updates, alongside comprehensive data, whenever our teams identify and remove these campaigns, however, this year, due to technical issues and significant risks to the physical safety of our employees posed by certain disclosures, we have only provided one update. During this time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to identify a sustainable path forward, without compromising on our goals of providing meaningful transparency.\nToday, in addition to disclosing eight additional datasets in our archive, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing an update on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned from these efforts and how we intend to advance data-driven transparency in 2022 and beyond.\nWhat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned so far\nMeaningful transparency begins with access to data. The data we publish about information operations allows researchers to understand not just that a platform manipulation campaign took place and that Twitter removed it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but precisely which narratives that campaign aimed to advance, and how widely they spread on Twitter. Access to raw content, rather than limited samples and aggregate information, is important.\nRaw data isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accessible to everyone. Many of the datasets we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve released include hundreds of thousands of Tweets and gigabytes of media. Processing this information often requires advanced tooling and capabilities. Academics, independent researchers, NGOs and data journalists play a key part in translating raw data into meaningful insights, as well as providing critical context in understanding how bad actors operate. Partnerships with the Stanford Internet Observatory and Australia Strategic Policy Institute have helped put these datasets in analytic and narrative context, along with a conference dedicated to studying this data we held in conjunction with the Carnegie Institute.\nConfident attribution isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always possible. Our transparency approach has focused on activity we can confidently attribute to a state actor. Emergent behaviors, including the use of disinformation-for-hire vendors and increasing operational security, sometimes make confident attribution impossible based solely on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own data. This doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the activity in question less important to analyze, but our policies presently prevent dataset disclosure in these cases. Moreover, access to this data, without attribution, may allow experts to piece together operations across multiple platforms and services that is not possible by just one company.\nInformation operations are just one area of public concern. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided an unprecedented level of transparency about state-backed information operations, given their severe impact on public discourse around the world. As Camille Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois and evelyn douek have pointed out, other content moderation domains of equal public concern don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t receive the same treatment.\nWhere we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re headed in 2022\nWith these lessons in mind, as well as the emergent risks we see to the physical safety of our employees around the world tied to potential disclosures, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re changing our approach in an effort to continue to provide expanded transparency about our content moderation actions. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in the coming months:\nIn early 2022, we will launch the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a global group of experts from across academia, civil society, NGOs, and journalism studying platform governance issues.\nMembership in the consortium will be granted to groups or individuals with:\n- A proven track record of research on content moderation and integrity topics (or affiliation with a group that does such research, such as a university, research lab, or newspaper).\n- Appropriate plans and systems for safeguarding the privacy and security of the data provided by the consortium.\nWe will be fully public about the standards used to determine membership in the consortium, and will bias towards inclusion and access, particularly for emerging researchers and researchers from historically under-represented communities and parts of the world.\nTwitter will not exercise any control or judgment over the findings or focus areas of the research produced using this data by members of the consortium.\nThe more than 200 researchers around the world with existing access to our unhashed information operations datasets will be invited to join the consortium through an expedited process. Other qualifying individuals and institutions are welcome to apply. We will share additional details about this process in early 2022 in advance of any disclosures to the consortium.\nWe will provide comprehensive data about attributed platform manipulation campaigns to members of the consortium, who may independently choose to publish their findings on the basis of the data we share and their own research. Under this model, we will also begin to share data about platform manipulation campaigns for which we have not been able to arrive at confident attribution to a state actor, and campaigns where we are unable to provide broad access due to employee safety concerns.\nLater in 2022, we will for the first time share similarly comprehensive data about other policy areas, including misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs part of this change, we will discontinue our fully public dataset releases, prioritizing release to the consortium. Existing datasets will continue to be available for download indefinitely \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and our public data offerings, including free access to our APIs (including the full archive of Tweets) remain available. \nOur efforts in this space are underpinned by our Privacy Policy which has long informed people how we may use the data they share with us. This includes sharing or disclosing information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to protect the safety or integrity of our platform, including to help prevent spam, abuse, or malicious actors, or to explain why we have removed content or accounts from our services. As we highlighted in our position paper setting out principles for policymakers drafting new regulations, we urge policymakers to build protections for this kind of data sharing into the laws that govern data privacy. \nTransparency is core to our mission. Our goal with these changes is to provide more transparency about more issues, while grappling with the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges in this space. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to learn and iterate on our approach over time and share those findings publicly along the way. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n7 June 2022\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re opening up the Twitter Moderation Research Consortium to a limited group of researchers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use this initial period to gather learnings and make adjustments to program design, where needed, ahead of our forthcoming public launch. Feedback from these researchers will help shape and inform our work.\u00c2\u00a0\nDuring this period, membership will be open to applicants who were granted access to our information operation data sets during prior disclosures. Researchers with prior access may re-apply for the Consortium during this phase, and will be evaluated in line with the below updated criteria:\nHold a primary institutional affiliation with an academic, journalistic, nonprofit, or civil society research organization. If they are students, they must be master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s or PhD level students; undergraduate students are ineligible at this time.\nHave prior experience and relevant skills for data-driven analysis. Consortium datasets are primarily shared as JSON files and require technical skills to analyze.\u00c2\u00a0\nDemonstrate a specific public interest research use case for the data provided by the Consortium. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cPublic interest research use case\u00e2\u0080\u009d means non-commercial research for journalistic, academic, or non-profit/civil society purposes.)\nEquipped with industry-standard plans and systems for safeguarding the privacy and security of the data provided by the Consortium. Consortium members are required to sign a data use agreement.\nLater this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open up the application for Consortium membership to the wider public and share key learnings from the beta period.\nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said previously, transparency is core to our work here. Through this updated approach, we aim to share more about what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on the Twitter service, while addressing the safety, security, and integrity challenges that accompany these disclosures. Down the line, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll disclose data about other policy areas, including misinformation, coordinated harmful activity, and safety. More to come.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n24 August 2022\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing an update on our Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) program. In the coming days, our TMRC global partners \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the Stanford Internet Observatory, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, and Cazadores de Fake News \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will publish independent research about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest information operation data sets. These 15 data sets include platform manipulation campaigns originating from the Americas, Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (EMEA), and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).\u00c2\u00a0\nAs we noted last year (above), we will now prioritize sharing information operations data with the Consortium. While we continue to share data with researchers about the networks we remove \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Twitter's assessment of the presumptive country of origin, based on the technical signals that we observe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will no longer provide specific attribution information. Meaning, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t publicly disclose whether an information operation was carried out by a specific state actor, or other actor.\nOur goal is to remain transparent about the activity we identify on Twitter, while addressing the considerable safety, security, and integrity challenges that come with disclosures of this kind. Information operations are also increasingly hard to attribute to specific actors \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 this change allows us to disclose data from a broader set of coordinated campaigns. Further, this change will allow researchers to piece together operations across multiple platforms and services, beyond what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible with just one platform. \nWe continue to draw learnings from the initial early access period. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on developing a global group of Consortium members, and to date, have accepted applications from researchers around the world. Later this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll open the TMRC application process to a broader group of researchers.\u00c2\u00a0 \nDown the line, we intend to share data about a wider range of Safety and Integrity policy areas. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

The account sets include eight distinct operations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve attributed to six countries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Mexico, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, Tanzania, Uganda, and Venezuela, respectively. Every account and piece of content associated with these operations has been permanently removed from the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition, we have shared relevant data from this disclosure with three leading research partners: the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), Cazadores de Fake News, and the Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO). In most instances, accounts were suspended for various violations of our platform manipulation and spam policies. See more via our Transparency Center.  Below, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve outlined information about our latest disclosure.

But ending AIDS requires ending inequalities, which necessitates transformative change. The course corrections we need to end AIDS will also protect the world against future pandemics. Therefore, we are very pleased to partner with Twitter in our journey ahead. This World AIDS Day, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d encourage everyone to use #ThereIsHelp to access critical information around HIV, and remind ourselves that global inequalities affect us all, no matter who we are or where we are from.

We also recognized that it is crucial for the public to have access to a free and #OpenInternet in combating the stigma around HIV. Therefore, we are partnering with public health authorities and local nonprofit organizations across Asia Pacific and the Americas to provide people with access to accurate information about HIV via launching a dedicated #ThereisHelp notification prompt for HIV.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHIV stigma during COVID-19 HIV remains a major issue to public health in 2021, despite significant progress having been made in recent decades. Division and disparity for human rights have long been the contributing factors to the difficulty faced by people living with HIV. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult by exacerbating inequities and disruptions to services related to HIV. In 2020, around 800,000 children aged 0-14 years were living with HIV with no access to HIV treatments.\nThis year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theme of World AIDS Day is \u00e2\u0080\u009cEnd inequalities. End AIDS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a special focus on highlighting the growing inequalities in access to essential HIV services.\u00c2\u00a0WHO is calling on global leaders and citizens to rally to confront the inequalities that drive AIDS and to reach people who are currently not receiving essential HIV services.\nData from Twitter shows that conversations about HIV spikes around\u00c2\u00a0#WorldAIDSDay on December 1 every year. In 2020, there were close to 9 million Tweets about HIV globally, out of which over 1 million Tweets were generated in December 2020.\nAt Twitter, we recognize our role and responsibility to help ensure that people can access and receive support on our service when they need it the most. The various communities on Twitter are a source of positive support and are thriving; encouraging each other who may be struggling with stigma or lack of information around HIV, and to reach out for professional help.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nUnited to help provide more access to information  We recognize that access to a free and\u00c2\u00a0#OpenInternet\u00c2\u00a0and collaboration \u00e2\u0080\u0094 public, private and community \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the key to combating the stigma around HIV. As local organizations continue to use Twitter as a channel to identify and reach out to vulnerable people who they may otherwise not have contact with, and to raise awareness of their important services; we hope that the #ThereIsHelp notification service will complement these efforts.\nBelow are our trusted NGO and government partners in this initiative that have made the #ThereIsHelp HIV notification prompt possible in 30 markets and in 12 languages.

I recently spoke with her about the evolution of social intelligence within organizations and what the most successful ones are getting right.\nJoe: To start, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your favorite Twitter follow? Jillian: Generally, I love following Scottish Twitter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very funny! My favourite account is Daily Overview (@DOverview) where you view the world looking down from the sky. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beautiful.\nJoe: Tell us about the history of The SILab and where the idea came from? Jillian: All of this started off as a passion project for me. I was in Scotland doing my PhD on social media and looking to connect with others with an interest in the space.\u00c2\u00a0 This was 2018 and I found that people in the research and insights industry didn't understand it properly and treated social insights with a bit of skepticism. But I kept looking and interestingly enough, I found that there was quite a community of practitioners out there, but they weren't connected.\u00c2\u00a0 So, the whole premise of the Social Intelligence Lab was to bring these people together to further our knowledge of this emerging source of insight. Key to this was it being driven by the practitioners themselves and not the vendors who would have their own agenda.\nJoe: We first met in the autumn of 2018 at your conference which was probably the first dedicated to this idea of social intelligence. Has it since matured and spread as much as you had hoped? Jillian: The idea that organizations need to be aware of signals from social media data is quite mainstream these days, however in many cases it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not true social intelligence but rather a narrower focus on using social data to better optimize your social media marketing strategy. This is a legitimate use case of course, but it misses out on the value social data brings to making better decisions across the organization. If you are not doing that, and just tracking mentions, then you are just doing social listening.\nJoe: What is your definition of social intelligence by the way? Jillian: Social intelligence is the analysis of digital conversations to answer questions, test hypotheses or find insights that can be used to guide decision making. It has recently morphed into consumer intelligence or digital consumer intelligence, which I would say is an effort by the tech companies to differentiate their products as they begin to explore a wider variety of data sources rather than being a whole new discipline. Most practitioners would typically use these data sources anyway. If you Google \u00e2\u0080\u0098social intelligence\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you'll get a lot of links to do with emotional intelligence, which is quite interesting to me because I think they're very similar. A real strength of social data is the ability to understand people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authentic emotions on a topic.\nJoe: Covid and the ensuing lockdowns were a big shock to the consumer insights industry forcing many to pivot their opinion gathering techniques. Do you think this experience has opened the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes to the value of social insights? Jillian: I think it has, but the bigger issue is the ability to get the work done successfully. I know of several brands that went out and procured new solutions to help them gather social insights but once they had them, realized they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use them because they lacked the expertise to get value from these solutions. This highlights the skills gap that exists and probably also highlights why the specialist social intelligence agencies are doing so well: brands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do this analysis work themselves and are having to outsource it. All the specialist agencies we work with have reported dramatic increases in their work and are hiring staff to keep up.\nJoe: Can you talk more about the skills gap you mentioned? Jillian: Social listening solutions are often billed as DIY insight tools with this idea that you can give it to anybody in the organization, train them up and off they go. This democratization of social data certainly sounds great in theory, but we know from the more mature, advanced organizations that this approach of onboarding half the company on a tool doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, and what you need to democratize instead is the insights. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it's time consuming to cleanse and segment data and interpret the findings in a meaningful way. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly not for a novice to do or someone who is only logging-in once a week to take a quick look at a dashboard.\nJoe: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re therefore arguing for a \u00e2\u0080\u0098Centre of Excellence\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that can feed different parts of the organization with social insights tailored to their specific needs? Jillian: Yes, definitely. We are seeing many enterprise organizations building out listening teams or social intelligence teams that often are part of the org\u00e2\u0080\u0099s broader insights function. Their job is to embed themselves into specific business units or departments delivering social insights to those teams and educating them on the kinds of problems or questions that social data can answer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one part delivery and another part education.\nJoe: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a best practice for getting this set up? Jillian: Many organizations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success has started with their senior leadership promoting the importance of not just social intelligence, but data driven decision making, of which social data is one part. Your interview with Adam Mills highlighting British Telecom\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey is a great example. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also say that a vast majority of the time, when an organization is investing in social data heavily, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because social insights helped them come through some sort of crisis where it provided a real-time pulse of what was happening that they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get anywhere else. Utilizing this type of experience to your advantage is important. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen organizations grow internal adoption by sending daily briefings customized to specific departments and personas. This makes it more tangible, and people get interested.\nJoe: You mentioned that more and more organizations are seeing the value in insights from social data. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keeping it from being used more consistently in market research? Jillian: I think a big part of it is in the data access models available to market researchers. Most of the social listening solutions have historically required a year-long contract which doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always fit well with the episodic, project-based world of market researchers who may only need access for a few weeks at a time. More flexible consumption models would certainly make it easier for them to access the data they need. Another challenge is that most of the solutions haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been built with market researchers in mind. They [market researchers] tend to want to get the data out of the solution so they can create their own code frames and segmentations and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not particularly easy. I do see it improving however as the listening solutions see a huge growth opportunity in market research.\nJoe: On that point of technology, text and image analytics have come a long way in just the past few years. Are these advances the missing link allowing new personas to unlock more insight across new use cases? Jillian: There has been technological development in the area, but it is not the technology that unlocks the value. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not in a place yet where having the technology is going to be the missing link and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d argue that we should never sell social intelligence in this way. Businesses need to invest in skills, the experts with social insight experience. It is these people who are going to unlock more insight and use cases across the organization. We need to identify the use cases and questions where social data can support the business, not be led by new functionality in technology to tell us what we should be doing. If we look at image analysis, there is huge potential for insights here but if you speak to a semiotician they would say the tech does not help them gain insights from the data easily. I think this is the main reason organizations are struggling to make visual listening work for them, as just one example.\nJoe: Final question then...what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superpower? Jillian: In wider society, it's the surfacing of cultural trends, meaning what big trends are becoming important. Your cultural trends report is always a good read. At a brand level, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer experience - instead of looking at cx data at the individual level, go macro and you can learn a lot.\nJoe: Many thanks for your time today, Jillian!\n\u00c2\u00a0\nInterested to learn more about how Twitter and our partners can support your social intelligence journey?

Under our private information policy, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t share the following types of private information or media, without the permission of the person who it belongs to:\nhome address or physical location information, including street addresses, GPS coordinates or other identifying information related to locations that are considered private;\nidentity documents, including government-issued IDs and social security or other national identity numbers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 note: we may make limited exceptions in regions where this information is not considered to be private;\ncontact information, including non-public personal phone numbers or email addresses;\u00c2\u00a0\nfinancial account information, including bank account and credit card details; and\nother private information, including biometric data or medical records.\nNEW: media of private individuals without the permission of the person(s) depicted.  \u00c2\u00a0\nThe following behaviors are also not permitted:\u00c2\u00a0\nthreatening to publicly expose someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private information;\nsharing information that would enable individuals to hack or gain access to someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private information without their consent,e.g., sharing sign-in credentials for online banking services;\nasking for or offering a bounty or financial reward in exchange for posting someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private information;\nasking for a bounty or financial reward in exchange for not posting someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private information, sometimes referred to as blackmail.\nWhen private information or media has been shared on Twitter, we need a first-person report or a report from an authorized representative in order to make the determination that the image or video has been shared without their permission. Learn more about reporting on Twitter.\nSharing private media\u00c2\u00a0 When we are notified by individuals depicted, or by an authorized representative, that they did not consent to having their private image or video shared, we will remove it. This policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or individuals when media and accompanying Tweet text are shared in the public interest or add value to public discourse.\nHowever, if the purpose of the dissemination of private images of public figures or individuals who are part of public conversations is to harass, intimidate, or use fear to silence them, we may remove the content in line with our policy against abusive behavior.. Similarly, private nude images of public individuals will continue to be actioned under our non-consensual nudity policy.\nWe recognize that there are instances where account holders may share images or videos of private individuals in an effort to help someone involved in a crisis situation, such as in the aftermath of a violent event, or as part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value, and this might outweigh the safety risks to a person. \nWe will always try to assess the context in which the content is shared and, in such cases, we may allow the images or videos to remain on the service. For instance, we would take into consideration whether the\u00c2\u00a0 image is publicly available and/or is being covered by mainstream/traditional media (newspapers, TV channels, online news sites), or if a particular image and the accompanying tweet text adds value to the public discourse, is being shared in public interest, or is relevant to the community.\nFeeling safe on Twitter is different for everyone, and our teams are constantly working to understand and address these needs. We know our work will never be done, and we will continue to invest in making our product and policies more robust and transparent to continue to earn the trust of the people using our service.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

This is an exceptionally volatile time, where certain types of content online can have a very real impact offline. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to share more on our response to date.  In times of crisis, there are a number of tools we deploy to ensure harmful content is not amplified and to limit the visibility of such content across Twitter.

We also learned they want even more customization, exclusive first-looks, and the ability to make their Twitter experience more functional.

This ambitious reduction goal, in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement, is a key component of our net-zero journey.\u00c2\u00a0 We continue to collaborate with environmental leaders, the scientific community, and industry partners, such as through work with the global We Mean Business coalition and the United Nations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Race to Zero campaign.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to do.

As of June 2022, Shop Spotlight is now available to all merchants in the US.\u00c2\u00a0Last updated: July 25, 2022.\nRemember 2015? The timeline was divided about the true color of this dress. We got our first up close look at Pluto. Culottes were cool. And at Twitter, we were in the early stages of exploring shopping on Twitter with features like the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuy Now\u00e2\u0080\u009d button, product pages and product collections.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe eventually stepped back from our shopping pursuits to focus on other areas. Now, as you heard from us earlier this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re back and putting more energy into testing out the potential for shopping on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs one of our first steps forward, today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching a pilot of the Shop Spotlight -- a feature that allows us to explore how shoppable profiles can create a pathway from talking about and discovering products on Twitter to actually purchasing them.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe Shop Spotlight is a dedicated space at the top of a profile where businesses can showcase their products. When people visit a profile with the Shop Spotlight enabled, they can scroll through the carousel of products and tap through on a single product to learn more and purchase -- seamlessly in an in-app browser, without having to leave Twitter.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting small with a handful of brands in the United States. People in the U.S. who use Twitter in English on iOS and Android devices will be able to see the Shop Spotlight.\nWe believe in the power of the conversations that Twitter facilitates around products. With this pilot, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get to explore how our engaged, responsive and chatty audience reacts to products that are emotionally charged -- like a new jersey from your favorite sports team -- or that provide lasting impact -- like a new skincare regimen. And, fundamentally, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give us the chance to keep learning about which shopping experiences people prefer on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs we learn, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re creating deeper partnerships with businesses that reflect whom we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building for with a new Merchant Advisory Board. The board will consist of brands that have established themselves as best-in-class examples of merchants on Twitter. With their partnership, we hope to more easily address the needs of businesses of any size or vertical in our product innovation.\nWhile the Shop Spotlight is a step in better-supporting shopping on Twitter, it also builds upon our efforts around Professional Profiles, which we started introducing earlier this year. With modular components for Professional Profiles, businesses across the globe \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from small businesses and legacy brands to creator-founded businesses \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will have access to customized profiles with features intended to help drive engagement and business outcomes.\u00c2\u00a0\nStay tuned. Though we are in very early explorations, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited about the potential of shopping on Twitter and eager to learn more as we go.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ncommerce\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMeasure your launch and connect campaigns using Twitter Brand Surveys\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 3 December 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nIntroducing Topics\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 11 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          "}

In that announcement, we shared that we would begin this process with the Brand Safety audit.\nOur team has spent the first half of 2021 working with the MRC to align on the scope, sequencing, and timing of the audits. We are pleased to announce that we have signed an agreement with the MRC for a Brand Safety pre-assessment and we are excited to begin reaching additional milestones as we move into the second half of this year.\nTwitter and the MRC have agreed that the Brand Safety audit will assess our compliance with certain Brand Safety standards when serving ads in environments including Home timeline, User profiles, Search results, and our Amplify pre-roll product. In the coming months, we will undergo a pre-assessment process which is designed to help both Twitter and the MRC assess the audit-readiness of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations, methodology, processing, reporting, and disclosures in the Brand Safety space. We will use the findings of this pre-assessment to identify any areas of improvement and agree on high-level recommendations for remediating any gaps.\u00c2\u00a0\nGiven the established scope of the MRC Brand Safety audit, Twitter is also committed to continuing to work with the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) to align on industry standards and to help shape how the advertising industry as a whole thinks about brand safety, brand suitability, and other safety and integrity issues.\nSimultaneously, we are continuing to work towards the next big milestones which include agreements with the MRC about the scope of and timelines for the Audience Measurement, Viewability, and Sophisticated Invalid Traffic Filtration audits. We expect to tackle the Audience Measurement audit next, with the remaining two to follow in sequence.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe look forward to the future of our engagement with the MRC and are excited to continue our progress towards achieving accreditation in all four of the aforementioned areas.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nFleets: a new way to join the conversation\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 November 2020\n          \nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nTransparency around image cropping and changes to come \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 1 October 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          "}

Despite progress with vaccines in some countries, the pandemic still rages in others, exacerbating inequality. We have seen a surge in antisemitism, Arab hate and Islamophobia following violence in Israel and Palestine. We were rocked by revelations of unmarked grave sites of indigenous communities in Canada, and we continue to grapple with racial justice and abuse, most recently spotlighted in the aftermath of the Euros, and protecting the right to vote in the US.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese challenges remind us of the importance and urgency of our work.

What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point of investing deeply in hiring great talent from underrepresented backgrounds if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t create an environment that constantly empowers them to share and leverage their unique perspectives and insights at your company?\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs) - central to driving inclusion across the company\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe receive a lot of questions about the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done with our BRGs over the past few years, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sharing an overview here. \nWe kicked off a company-wide listening tour with the leaders of our BRGs in 2018 and learned a lot from them. The most common theme was around resourcing and support: Tweeps were struggling to balance their full time role with their vast BRG responsibilities, their managers didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have visibility into their BRG work or the tools to empower them, and there was confusion about where to go in the business for resources or support. We also heard a lot about the desire to be more globally inclusive and intersectional in the work\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 but they already had too much on their plate. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we responded:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nExpanding BRG leadership: In 2019, we expanded the leadership team of each BRG from two co-chairs to a global team of five co-chairs, adding an events chair, a marketing/comms chair, and a recruitment chair. The new guidelines initially required that at least half of the team be based outside of San Francisco and at least a quarter outside of the U.S. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve since replaced the recruitment chair with a social chair, and are moving towards a goal of at least half of each BRG leadership team being based outside of the U.S.\nDefining roles and responsibilities: Next we introduced job descriptions for each of the global chairs\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093and for their executive sponsors. For the BRG leaders, we provided guidelines for approximately how much time they should spend on BRG activities throughout the year, and tips for how to represent the work to their managers during 1:1s and in performance evaluations. For BRG executive sponsors, we provided recommendations for the cadence of regular meetings with the leadership teams, how best to engage in BRG events throughout the year, and ways to amplify BRGs in their roles as executive sponsors.\nDedicated resources: We also introduced a strategic planning process for the BRGs to align on OKRs and prioritize intersectional programming, a centralized dedicated budget within I&D, a full-time BRG program manager, and dedicated support across the business to assist with company-wide BRG activations within or beyond our walls.\nSupporting managers: In 2020, we interviewed the 60+ Tweeps who manage our BRG leaders 1:1 to understand the challenges they face. Based on what we heard, we designed and launched a Manager Toolkit to provide more visibility into the work of the BRG leaders they manage, guidance for how they can engage and support their Tweeps throughout the year, and how to acknowledge their leadership as part of annual performance reviews. Later, we launched the #GoodForTwitter initiative so that all Tweeps had the opportunity to list their involvement with BRGs as one of their annual performance goals and have it be part of annual performance reviews.\nDocumenting our process: We often get the question: \u00e2\u0080\u009ccan I start a BRG for ______ ?\u00e2\u0080\u009d We launched an internal New BRG Checklist with our criteria which involves the following questions: 1) What identity-based community would this BRG serve and is it currently represented by one of our already existing BRGs? 2) Is this community underrepresented at Twitter and/or in the world? 3) Is this a global community (e.g. is it relevant to Tweeps around the globe and not limited to a specific region)? 4) Has this community faced marginalization, oppression, discrimination or other barriers historically or presently that require dedicated support and resources from the Inclusion & Diversity team? 5) Will having a BRG for this community benefit Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I&D efforts?\nFormal compensation: Also in 2020, we introduced a formal compensation program for our BRG global leadership team. The work they are responsible for driving is central to our journey to becoming the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most diverse, inclusive, and accessible tech company. It is not a \u00e2\u0080\u009cside-hustle\u00e2\u0080\u009d or volunteer activity. To ensure fairness, we introduced term limits, a transparent election process, and FAQs for BRG members to ensure everyone knows what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involved.\nLaunching new BRGs: Earlier this year we launched @TwitterArabs and #TwitterIndigenous with the goal of connecting and uplifting more under-represented communities around the world. Moving forward, we have work to do to ensure our BRGs are just as impactful in countries outside of the US by investing more in leadership infrastructure and resources for regional programming.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe also know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work to do beyond BRGs. As we continue to build momentum in our diversity hiring, we are redoubling efforts across the business on inclusion.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCultivating an inclusive culture\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCore to belonging is ensuring that Tweeps who are most impacted by traumatizing world events get the support they need from us, while also ensuring allies can learn about the complex issues at hand and how to help. As the ground beneath us shifts, we continue to refine our approach. With each step we learn and grow, and appreciate the support of our Tweeps along the journey. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve expanded #FlockTalks around the world\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 Tweep-only sessions to hold space for those who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to come together in community to share how they're feeling during difficult times.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built on our #TakeCare programming to deliver even more culturally-competent and trauma-informed mental health resources to Tweeps. Recently, we brought in an Asian licensed therapist to help Asian Tweeps process the rise in anti-Asian hate and racism, and a Black licensed therapist (@drmarielbuque) to help Blackbirds process the murder of Daunte Wright and the Derek Chauvin trial.\nOur #AllyshipRightNow series has expanded to provide more tools for practicing allyship and reducing the emotional burden of asking marginalized tweeps for resources, for example, #StandForAsians\nOur #TwitterTogetherTalks are company-wide conversations fostering open dialogue about racial equity, anti-racism, and social justice here at Twitter. We recently hosted Professor Erika Lee (@prof_erikalee) for a conversation about the history of Anti-Asian hate and discrimination in the US.\nWe launched Mentoring@, a mentorship pilot program that intentionally centers underrepresented and underserved communities. The program also takes the traditionally hierarchical nature of mentorship into consideration, and ensures that mentees feel empowered and supported throughout. So far, we have over 250 mentors and mentees participating.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe recognize the challenges distributed teams have in building an inclusive and collaborative culture. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recently updated our onboarding resources to provide managers and teams with more support and guide best practices for fostering team unity and inclusion. We also launched a new initiative for all people managers to drive participation in existing company-wide I&D programs that help build an inclusive mindset. Starting this year, all Tweeps who manage people are required to get their #InclusiveManagerBadge\u00f0\u009f\u008f\u0085 by:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCompleting all I&D skills-building courses: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAllyship 101,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy Conversations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWords Matter\u00e2\u0080\u009d (on microaggressions) and the soon to launch \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnti-Racism 101\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMaintaining a \u00e2\u0080\u009cInclusive Manager\u00e2\u0080\u009d minimum score of 67 in our two annual employee engagement surveys\nAttending at least four BRG events throughout the year.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFor 2021, we are also developing Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principles of Inclusive Leadership, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll integrate into our manager onboarding, and launch as a stand-alone e-learning module so anyone, anywhere can take the training, regardless of role, tenure or location. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe've also deepened our collaboration with the Employee Relations (ER) team as they are on the front lines of fielding concerns when underrepresented Tweeps feel excluded. For example, our I&D Health Check Up program\u00c2\u00a0(a monthly customized report for each member of our leadership team) now includes information about the prevalence of gender and race-related complaints raised to ER. This helps our executive leadership better understand the types of issues that adversely impact Tweeps' experiences, including the extent to which underrepresented Tweeps feel fairly and respectfully treated, as well as the best way to address root causes.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe were honored to receive a top score on the Disability Equality Index\u00c2\u00ae (DEI) for 2021 and be recognized as one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cBest Places to Work for Disability Inclusion\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We also recently joined The Valuable 500, a coalition of companies and leaders committed to putting accessibility front and center.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recently expanded our International I&D team including @Olivia_McEvoy, our new I&D International Lead who is based in Dublin. We are excited for what the future holds, including in tailoring regionally relevant solutions as well as programs for the hiring, retention and promotion of Tweeps around the world.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe also know we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all the answers.

We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter. But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped. Because of this, on August 3, Fleets will no longer be available on Twitter.\nUsing our learnings from Fleets, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll focus on creating other ways for people to join the conversation and talk about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in their world. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some of what we learned and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next:\nAlthough we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own Tweets and talk directly with others. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explore more ways to address what holds people back from participating on Twitter. And for the people who already are Tweeting, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on making this better for you.\nMost Fleets include media \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0people enjoy quickly sharing photos and videos to add to the discussion on Twitter. Soon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll test updates to the Tweet composer and camera to incorporate features from the Fleets composer \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0like the full-screen camera, text formatting options, and GIF stickers.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe top of the timeline continues to be a good spot to highlight what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening right now so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still see Spaces there when someone you follow is hosting or speaking in a live audio conversation.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur Fleet ads test, which concluded as planned last month, was one of our first explorations of full-screen, vertical format ads. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking a close look at learnings to assess how these ads perform on Twitter.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re evolving what Twitter is, and trying bigger, bolder things to serve the public conversation. A number of these updates, like Fleets, are speculative and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work out. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be rigorous, evaluate what works, and know when to move on and focus elsewhere. If we're not evolving our approach and winding down features every once in a while \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 we're not taking big enough chances. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to build new ways to participate in conversations, listening to feedback and changing direction when there may be a better way to serve people using Twitter.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          \nMeasure your launch and connect campaigns using Twitter Brand Surveys\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 3 December 2019\n          \nIntroducing Topics\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 11 November 2019\n          "}

Over the past year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve experienced and continue to navigate severe global challenges, including the coronavirus pandemic. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen concerted attempts by governments to limit access to the Internet generally and to Twitter specifically. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSince 2012, the Twitter Transparency Report has offered a window into our work to enforce the Twitter Rules, protect privacy, navigate increased requests from governments around the world, disrupt state-backed information operations, and more. Now, amid an increasingly complex global landscape, continued transparency around our own efforts to protect the public conversation is paramount.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur latest Twitter Transparency Center update includes data from July 1 to December 31, 2020. While we continue to share data across consistent, recurring categories, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing new data that can provide meaningful insights into the impact of our actions. Our new impressions metric captures the number of views violative Tweets received prior to removal. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also including more information about the adoption of two-factor authentication, part of our work to keep accounts safe and secure. \nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noted previously, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations were severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the latter half of 2020, as was the case with the prior reporting period. Varying country-specific COVID-19 restrictions and adjustments within our teams affected the efficiency of our content moderation work and the speed with which we enforced our policies. We increased our use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially misleading and manipulative content. Like many organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 both public and private around the world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the disruptions caused by COVID-19 made an impact on our company and are reflected in some of the data shared today.\u00c2\u00a0 \nImpressions\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to enabling safe and healthy conversations on the service, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always looking for ways to share more context about our enforcement of the Twitter Rules. Our impressions metric captures the number of views a violative Tweet received prior to removal.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn total, impressions on violative Tweets accounted for less than 0.1% of all impressions for all Tweets globally, from July 1 through December 31. During this time period, Twitter removed 3.8 million Tweets that violated the Twitter Rules; 77% of which received fewer than 100 impressions prior to removal, with an additional 17% receiving between 100 and 1,000 impressions. Only 6% of removed Tweets had more than 1,000 impressions.\u00c2\u00a0\nMore broadly, as we work to remove harmful, violative content quickly and at scale, whether amid a global health crisis or during a high stakes election, these numbers represent both our present efficiency and where improvement is needed. Our goal is to improve these numbers over time, taking enforcement action on violative content before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even viewed.\nCOVID-19\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolves around the world, we continue to take enforcement action on misleading information about COVID-19, particularly that which puts people at risk and could lead to harm.\u00c2\u00a0\nFrom July to December 2020, we challenged 10,320,924 accounts. The account challenge number represents a large volume of proactive anti-spam challenges we issued, targeting platform manipulation focused on COVID-19 discussions. We rolled out a set of proactive challenges specifically focused on COVID-19. We suspended 597 accounts, and removed 3,846 pieces of content. Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance last year, to the time of this publication, we have challenged 11.7 million accounts, suspended 1,496 accounts, and removed over 43,010 pieces of content worldwide.\nYou can learn more about our COVID-19 misinformation policy here.\nGlobal legal requests\nInformation Requests\nProtecting the privacy of people who use Twitter is important to us.\u00c2\u00a0 We produced some or all of the requested information in response to 30% of these information requests; 4,367 total.\nIndia is the single largest source of government information requests, accounting for 25% of the global volume and 15% of the global accounts specified.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe second highest volume of information requests originated from the United States, comprising 22% of global information requests.\nThe United States submitted the highest volume of global emergency requests (34%), followed by Japan (17%), and South Korea (16%).\nRemoval Requests \u00c2\u00a0(legal demands for content removal)\nDuring this reporting period, Twitter received 38,524 legal demands to remove content specifying 131,933 accounts. We withheld or otherwise removed some or all of the reported content in response to 29% of these global legal demands; 11,091 total.\nAlthough there was a 9% decrease in the number of legal demands Twitter received, compared to the previous reporting period, these requests sought removal of content from the largest number of accounts ever in a single reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nAccounts of 199 verified journalists and news outlets from around the world were subject to 361 legal demands, a 26% increase in these requests since the previous reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nAnd, 94% of the total global volume of legal demands originated from only five countries (in decreasing order): Japan, India, Russia, Turkey, and South Korea.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur reporting processes are designed to be transparent and to enable real accountability. Where possible, we provide user notice when we receive these requests. Importantly, unless we are prohibited from doing so, when we remove or withhold content in a certain country, Twitter will provide a copy of the request to the publicly available Lumen Database. When content is withheld, it is only withheld in the country making the removal demand and remains visible in all other jurisdictions.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Rules enforcement\nWe continue to step up the level of proactive enforcement across the service and invest in technological solutions to respond to ever-evolving malicious online activity. Today, by using technology, 65% of the abusive content we action is surfaced proactively for human review, instead of relying on reports from people using Twitter.\nAbuse and harassment\nWe launched a number of initiatives, like more precise machine learning, to better detect and take action on content that violated this policy. As a result, there was a 142% increase in accounts actioned*, compared to the previous reporting period; 964,459 in total.\u00c2\u00a0\nChild sexual exploitation\nWe do not tolerate child sexual exploitation (CSE) on Twitter. In the majority of cases, the consequence for violating our CSE policy is immediate and permanent suspension, and violators are prohibited from creating any new accounts in the future. Violative content is removed and reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC).\nThere was a 6% increase in the number of accounts suspended for violations of our child sexual exploitation policy during this reporting period. In total, 464,804 unique accounts were suspended, 90% of which were proactively identified by employing internal proprietary tools and industry hash sharing initiatives.\nNon-consensual nudity\nWe took enforcement action on 27,087 accounts containing non-consensual nudity, an increase of 194% from the prior reporting period. From July to December 2020, we\u00c2\u00a0 saw the largest increase in the number of accounts actioned under this policy.\n*\"Accounts actioned\" reflects the number of unique accounts that were suspended or required content removal for violating the Twitter Rules.\nTerrorism and violent extremism\nThere was a 35% decrease in the number of accounts permanently suspended for violations of our terrorism and violent extremism policies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 96% of those accounts were proactively identified using a combination of machine learning and human review. Action was taken on 58,750 unique accounts under this policy during this reporting period.\nWe continue to utilize and contribute to the shared industry hash database supported by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).\nCivic integrity\nCivic integrity policy enforcements increased significantly, by 175%, compared to the previous reporting period, largely driven by Tweets related to the United States 2020 election.\nDuring the United States 2020 election, we enacted a set of policy, enforcement and product changes to add context, encourage thoughtful consideration, and reduce the potential for misleading information to spread on Twitter. From October 27 to November 11, for example, we labeled approximately 300,000 Tweets that contained claims that were disputed and potentially misleading.\u00c2\u00a0\nHateful conduct\nThere was a 77% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our hateful conduct policy during this reporting period \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from 635,415 accounts, to 1,126,990 accounts.\nIn September 2020, we began enforcing our hateful conduct policy against content that incites fear and/or fearful stereotypes about protected categories, as we were seeing increased harassment of some protected categories during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, we further expanded our hateful conduct policy to include content that dehumanizes on the basis of race, ethnicity, or national origin.\u00c2\u00a0\nPromoting suicide & self-harm\nFrom July to December 2020, we actioned 188,561 accounts compared to 64,610 during the previous reporting period, accounting for a 192% increase in enforcement.\nSuicide and self-harm are significant social and public health challenges, and we recognize that we have a responsibility to help people access support when they need it. We continue to offer resources to support those experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, like our #ThereIsHelp search prompt. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve introduced new initiatives to better detect and take action on content that violates our policy on suicide and self-harm.\nPlatform manipulation\nAnti-spam challenges increased by approximately 6% compared to the previous reporting period. In addition, we observed an approximate 14% decrease in the number of spam reports from the previous reporting period.\nCopyright\nSubmissions of Digital Millennium Copyright Act takedown notices decreased by 2%, and we saw a 44% decrease in accounts affected. Tweets withheld and media withheld also dropped by 25% and 43% respectively, as Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations were affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a security incident in July 2020.\nAccount security\u00c2\u00a0\nWe continue to encourage two-factor authentication (2FA) for all accounts, and a number of other best practices to help keep accounts safe and secure. Over time, we hope to see more people on Twitter adopt enhanced security measures for their accounts.\nApproximately 2.3% of accounts have enabled at least one 2FA method during the reporting period.\nConclusion\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to increasing our transparency and improving our accountability to you, the public, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to publish updates to the Twitter Transparency Center on a biannual basis.\nFollow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for updates on our policies and our work on transparency throughout the year.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

Starting today, people on Twitter have the option to use security keys as their only form of two-factor authentication (2FA), which is the most effective way to keep your Twitter account secure.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile any form of 2FA is better than no 2FA, physical security keys are the most effective. Security keys are small devices that act like keys to your house. Just as you need a physical key to unlock the door to your home, you need a security key to unlock access to your account. Security keys offer the strongest protection for your Twitter account because they have built-in protections to ensure that even if a key is used on a phishing site, the information shared can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be used to access your account. They use the FIDO and WebAuthn security standards to transfer the burden of protecting against phishing attempts from a human to a hardware device. Security keys can differentiate legitimate sites from malicious ones and block phishing attempts that SMS or verification codes would not. \nTwitter has long encouraged the use of some form of 2FA. In 2018, we added the option to use security keys as one of several 2FA options. However, this initial support only worked for Twitter.com, not the mobile app, and required accounts to have another form of 2FA enabled as well. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn 2019, we upgraded our security key support to use the latest WebAuthn standard, which provides an up-to-date and secure authentication method recognized across the web. We also enabled the ability to use 2FA on a Twitter account without requiring a phone number, allowing people to protect their accounts from SIM-swapping attacks and opening up 2FA to more people. In 2020, we made additional improvements by enabling support for security keys on iOS and Android, in addition to the web. And earlier this year, we added the ability to register multiple security keys on your Twitter account, allowing you to have backup security keys and making it easier for accounts managed by multiple people to enable 2FA with multiple security keys.\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding the option to use security keys as your sole 2FA method \u00e2\u0080\u0094 meaning you can enroll one or more security keys as the only form of 2FA on your Twitter account without a backup 2FA method. We know this is important to people because not everyone is able to have a backup 2FA method or wants to share their phone number with us. With this update, we want everyone to feel empowered to enable security keys to better secure their Twitter account. \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to make updates and improvements to the ways you can keep your Twitter account secure. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsecurity\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMeasure your launch and connect campaigns using Twitter Brand Surveys\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 3 December 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nIntroducing Topics\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 11 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          "}

Dating from around 1750 BC in Mesopotamia, the small clay tablet describes how a man named Nanni was delivered the wrong grade of copper ore from a merchant named Ea-nasir. And Nanni wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happy, writing in a now extinct East Semitic language, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you take me for, that you treat somebody like me with such contempt?\u00e2\u0080\u009d1\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Complaint tablet to Ea-nasir, The British Museum\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nWe unfortunately don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how or if Nanni\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complaint was ever addressed, but this ancient artifact does highlight that as a species we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been complaining for a very long time. \nToday we call feedback like Nanni\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer experience, a term that has taken on many meanings recently. At its most basic, customer experience (CX) is the combination of all the interactions or touchpoints an organisation has with its customers. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a relatively new phenomenon, for it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t until the mid-20th century, with the rise of consumerism, that businesses started to take customer experience seriously as a way to differentiate themselves from the competition. And as these newly empowered consumers now had many choices, businesses realized they needed to do a better job of understanding their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 preferences and needs. This led to the birth of the market research industry and of various data collection techniques to capture consumer opinion and feedback. \nToday, we have an abundance of research methodologies, data analysis techniques and measures such as NPS and CSAT, but, by and large, customer experience programs are built on feedback collection methods that are 50+ years old. Forrester recently found that an astonishing 70% of organizations rely solely on surveys for customer feedback and a large percentage of these are email surveys.2 Ask yourself, when was the last time you actually completed one?\nPeople are inundated with survey requests these days resulting in low participation rates which ultimately leads to poor data and a lack of customer insight. To try and remedy this survey fatigue, organizations are increasingly incentivizing participation. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly nothing wrong with this, peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time is valuable and should be compensated, however the introduction of incentives has led to fraud driven by \u00e2\u0080\u0098professional\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responders as well as the plague of distributed survey farms and bots. As a result, data quality is suffering. \nSo, is there another way? The good news is, people haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stopped sharing their experiences and opinions, in fact, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing so now more than ever, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just doing it in different places. And this is increasingly in the apps and social networks where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already spending considerable time. The customer care component of CX has seen massive growth on Twitter throughout the pandemic as stores shuttered and phone lines were clogged. However, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the customer feedback element of Twitter that remains untapped and presents a huge opportunity for organizations to understand the real voices of their customers. \nBut these voices are different from the ones you commonly hear via surveys, which encourage filtered, rationally processed and controlled retrospective responses. Voices on Twitter are raw and emotive because they are expressed while people are actually having that experience. And because they are not directed by specific questions, they often surface feedback you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think to ask about. \nTwitter has always been a great place for organizations to engage with consumers, not only to resolve their issues and enquiries, but also to learn from the wealth of opinions they freely share. So instead of chasing people around the web or bombarding their inbox for feedback, what if you listened to what they were already saying?\nInterested to learn more about how Twitter can support your customer feedback initiatives?

We believe in a fair and forward-looking approach to regulation that protects what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best about our online environment and promotes the values of innovation, strong competition, and consumer choice that underpin the global, Open Internet.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBefore addressing the DSA directly, we note our concern regarding the ongoing fragmentation of Internet rule-making across the EU. Instead of recognising that a borderless utility like the Internet benefits from regional and global agreement of standards, countries are moving ahead with national models of regulation. This has the fundamental effect of undermining the foundational principle of the Digital Single Market (DSM), namely that its purpose is to create one set of rules for one market. Each national legislative initiative that overlaps or directly conflicts with the DSA picks at the threads of the DSM, fraying it further and further, making Europe a more challenging business environment for companies of all sizes. This challenge becomes greater for smaller companies that are already facing the formidable task of competing with the very largest players in our industry. We urge the Commission and the EU institutions to state clearly that the DSM must be preserved by coherent and regional rule-making, and that national measures should be discouraged. This issue goes to the heart of whether Europe is committed to creating a digital economy that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s built on the Open Internet.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFurther, we see a worrying trend whereby the EU or a member state will enact legislation with onerous and highly local requirements, or prescribe severe sanctions. The fairness of enforcement is dependent on due process protections embedded in the legal system around the law. Another country may then copy that law, often outside the EU, but its legal and political system places less emphasis on due process. In this way, more repressive regimes can exert pressure on platforms to comply with requests that would restrict certain businesses, freedom of expression, political dissent, journalism, and activism.\nThe EU and its member states must be careful to build due process protections into legislation that may be exported across borders. As Access Now has said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe DSA will set a precedent for content governance beyond the European Union. If not done right, the negative impact of this legislation could be far-reaching for human rights protection in the online ecosystem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s example here is critical and must be considered in an international context.\nWe urge policymakers across Europe to be mindful of their unique role at this time. The DSA is breaking new ground, largely for the positive, and this process of regional standard-setting should be allowed to play out before further action is taken at member state level. Done right, the introduction of harmonised standards across the EU will avoid stifling competition and innovation, leading to a more diverse online ecosystem, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll set a global benchmark for others to follow.\nPut simply, the DSA must defend the ideal of the Digital Single Market as Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to the Open Internet.\u00c2\u00a0\nLEGISLATING FOR THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET\nWe welcome the maintenance of a prohibition on general monitoring and the legislative focus on illegal content. We encourage policymakers to further clarify what content is considered illegal across the EU.\nHowever, we believe that focusing excessively on increasingly outmoded models of content moderation stifles competition and undermines freedom of expression. The DSA should encourage judicious and deliberate decision-making on content, rather than impose overreaching notice and takedown requirements that would incentivise risk-averse removal of content. European Digital Rights (EDRi) has noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a world in which people upload millions of hours of video and billions of photos and texts every day, it has become impossible to determine the legality of every single piece with certainty\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Most of those instances require an informed legality assessment by a trained professional in order to avoid a large number of wrongful removals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWe ask the EU to adopt the principle that actual knowledge of illegality is only obtained by intermediaries if it comes through a legally defined judicial process.\nWe further believe that a more nuanced approach would be in the best interests of the regulator, companies of all sizes, and the user. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said before, content policy can shape the competitive marketplace, and as such, overly rigid and intensive proposals (such as those set out in Articles 14 to 21) risk setting regulatory barriers that only a handful of companies have the resources to meet. Stanford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Daphne Keller says these provisions, as a whole, require that platforms of all sizes and varieties be \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeeply regulated, and regulable, or stop existing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It seems intuitive that the outcome of the system currently proposed will be to the benefit of the largest companies in our industry. Indeed, Keller goes on to say that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe DSA effectively forfeits competition and consumer choice as a way of shaping platform behavior, in favor of having a few heavily regulated entities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\nTherefore, we encourage regulators to include additional flexibility for deliberation, while placing more focus on business structure and incentives. The DSA should enshrine the principle that content moderation should be proportionate to the perceived harm. This will move us towards a more balanced approach to moderation, moving past the leave-up-take-down models of the past. In the long term, the question of how users encounter content may be more important than whether content exists, particularly as swathes of the Internet shift to a more decentralised existence.\nFurther, an assessment of how platforms offer users meaningful choice and control in their online experience will go to the heart of societal concerns regarding the Internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effect on democracies and the health of our information environment. By placing emphasis on these areas, regulators will have taken more holistic measures to counter potential online harms. Such policies will also stand the test of time, enduring beyond technological cycles.\u00c2\u00a0\nREAL CHOICE AND FAIR COMPETITION\nThe Open Internet thrives because of its architecture, with consumer choice and open standards between platforms. Open architectures, done properly, do not lock-in dominant business or service models. As several members of the European Parliament recently pointed out, interoperability protects users and competition. We welcome the European Commission\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposals in this area but also encourage decision-makers to include more robust provisions fostering interoperability in Chapter 3 of the DSA.\nThe Internet is more than a handful of companies. We call on policymakers to recognise this by including more precision in the criteria for very large online platforms (VLOPS) in Chapter 3, Section 4. Although a certain degree of latitude is needed to guarantee the flexibility of legislation, this should not be done at the expense of the online ecosystem by requiring smaller actors to meet requirements that only the largest, wealthiest, and market-dominant companies can shoulder. There is the perception of Internet companies and there is the reality \u00e2\u0080\u0093 sometimes the latter starkly differs from the former and the criteria for VLOPs should be grounded in practical reality.\u00c2\u00a0\nTRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\nThere is a need to strike the right balance between technical transparency and things that actually empower consumers with more choice and control. We support simple yet meaningful ways for users to exercise privacy and data choices, for example through greater control of ad targeting, while also requiring companies to set out their Terms of Service in simple, understandable terms.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe commit to continue increasing transparency around policy enforcement and data access to empower research and more disclosures around coordinated efforts to manipulate platforms. It is crucial that transparency requirements outlined in Articles 13 and 23 of the DSA should not undermine these efforts to protect users, or inadvertently expose services to potential harm, for example, exposing enforcement methods or techniques that could be leveraged to undermine those efforts.\nOur services are part of a larger information ecosystem that includes companies of all sizes, nonprofit organisations, publishers, academic institutions, and more. To ensure meaningful transparency, it is necessary that we have flexible and differentiated requirements across all sectors. These requirements should recognise how each entity approaches transparency in ways that reflect their operations.

These Tweets will appear right in your home timeline when you follow the Topic.\nAddressing the climate emergency requires collaboration, community, and widespread mobilization. Through #AdsForGood grants, events, on-service support, and trainings, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re partnering with organizations promoting and amplifying environmental conservation and sustainability. These include Earth Day Network, United Nations (UN) Environment Programme, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UN Development Programme, Greenpeace, Voice for the Planet, Let Me Breathe, WWF, 350.org, FridaysForFuture, We Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Have Time, Climate Reality Project, and others.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also made new environmental commitments and expanded Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustainability efforts. In partnership with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve committed to significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, paving the way for our net-zero journey.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe recognize that transparency and accountability should be central to our approach to sustainability. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited about the SBTi pledge because it advances Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environmental efforts in a clear and measurable way.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to protecting the environment, reducing our carbon footprint, and using our service to make a positive difference in the world. We continue to work toward our goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve partnered with Cool Effect, a nonprofit organization that helps offset emissions from our data centers and employee travel, to fund green projects around the world. So far, 92% of our global offices have achieved the \"Green Building Certified\" standard, with more to come.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mobilizing our workforce around the globe to participate and to make change at Twitter, but we know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more to do. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ramping up our sustainability goals company-wide.\nHow can you participate?\nWe all have a part we can play in tackling this global crisis. From volunteering with an environmental organization in your community, to learning more about protecting our planet, there are lots of ways to get involved. Promote sustainable causes and ideas, advocate to your elected representatives, and join the conversation. Every little bit matters. We encourage you to Tweet along with the #WorldEnvironmentDay conversation happening on Twitter and follow the Climate Change\u00c2\u00a0Topic\u00c2\u00a0for more.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npartnerships\npolicy\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nCommemorating the 50th Earth Day\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 22 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

We also started enforcing that policy by automatically removing the verified badge from accounts that no longer meet the updated criteria for verification, such as those that are inactive or incomplete. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re grateful for all who participated in our public feedback period and shared ideas for how we can improve verification on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application rollout marks the next milestone in our plans to give more transparency, credibility and clarity to verification on Twitter. Below, we share more about this application process and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next in our work to help people understand who they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interacting with on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat it means to be verified on Twitter\nThe blue badge is one of the ways we help people distinguish the authenticity of accounts that are of high public interest. It gives people on Twitter more context about who they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having conversations with so they can determine if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trustworthy, which our research has shown leads to healthier, more informed conversations.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application launch, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also introducing new guidelines for verified accounts on Twitter. These verification guidelines are intended to encourage healthy conversations for the betterment of the Twitter community overall. They follow the philosophy to lead by example, Tweet others how they want to be Tweeted, and serve the public conversation authentically, respectfully, and with consideration. As always, all accounts, including verified accounts, must follow the Twitter Rules. And as we previously shared, verified accounts that repeatedly violate the Twitter Rules are subject to have the blue badge removed.\nWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eligible?\nTo qualify for verification, you must fit the criteria of one of the six categories listed below:\u00c2\u00a0\nGovernment\nCompanies, brands and organizations\nNews organizations and journalists\nEntertainment\nSports and gaming\nActivists, organizers, and other influential individuals\nIn addition to the category-specific eligibility criteria outlined in our verification policy, your account must be complete, meaning you have a profile name, a profile image and either a confirmed email address or phone number. Your account must also be active within the last six months and have a record of adherence to the Twitter Rules. You can read more about ineligible accounts in the policy\u00c2\u00a0as well.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow can you apply to get verified?\u00c2\u00a0\nOver the next few weeks, everyone on Twitter will start to see the new verification application directly in the Account Settings tab. If you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see this update immediately today, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry! We're gradually rolling it out to everyone to ensure that we can review applications in a timely manner.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the application flow will look like:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnce you submit your application, you can expect an emailed response from us within a few days, but this could take up to a few weeks depending on how many open applications are in our queue. If your application is approved, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the blue badge automatically on your profile. If you think we made a mistake, reapply 30 days after receiving our decision on your application.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\nWe know that the current verification policy may not represent all of the people who should be eligible to be verified on Twitter, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning to introduce more categories later this year, such as those for scientists, academics, and religious leaders. To stay up-to-date with verification, be sure to follow @Verified.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also excited to continue expanding the ways people can express themselves on Twitter through their profile and launching new account types. Since our last update, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing ongoing research on automated accounts and plan to introduce a way to denote this account type in the next few months, with memorialized accounts to follow. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also exploring improvements to the Twitter profile to allow people to better express themselves, such as through an About page. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share more on all of this soon!\nWe look forward to continuing our work to give people more ways to identify and express themselves on Twitter to lead to more informed, healthier conversations.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

British Telecom (BT) has been on a five year journey to better utilize these social insights and so I spoke with Adam Mills, Brand Strategy & Planning Insight Manager, to learn more about their experience and how they are leveraging social intelligence to make better decisions across their business.\n JR: To start, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your favourite Twitter follow? AM: I love @Nigella_Lawson, in particular how she talks and interacts with other people. But my absolute favourite is @rebuildingmcr \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something so incredible about looking back at our city through the years and to see how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s changed and developed. JR: Ah, so not me? AM: Well, um...\nJR: So let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kick things off then. Give us some context on your role Adam. AM: I joined BT in 2017 as a brand analyst in the Group Digital Brand team, which supported business units across the organisation. My job was to gather the data needed to support our big digital transformation programmes, whether that was supporting app infrastructure and app consolidation or the group SEO strategy. At about that time our marketing and comms leadership team realized we needed to have a better understanding of what people were saying about us on social and therefore I also took on social listening.\nOver the next 18 months, social became an increasingly important part of my role, which evolved beyond just social listening to focus on our social capabilities and the infrastructure that supported them. I helped us analyze all the social accounts we maintained across multiple brands and to rethink their purpose. We sought to understand what was strategic and what wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, where to spend and where to pull back. This allowed me to take social listening beyond just listening and to start feeding it into new areas such as NPS and customer experience measurement. \nI then moved to a new team two years ago but took my role with me as we realized that social insights deserved a formal place within our larger insights function. This was great recognition of our work and the importance of social intelligence to the business. \nJR: How is BT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer insights team structured and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the main focus? AM: About three years ago a new insights director arrived and took a look around and realised that there were pockets of insight scattered across the business with lots of duplication as a result. She decided to bring everyone together under a Centre of Excellence which became a group function allowing it to serve the entire business. We are now a team of 80, broken up into a few teams covering topics such as commercial insights, market and competitive intelligence, brand insight and CX and group performance.\nOur purpose within the business is to put the customer at the heart of everything that we do, championing the customer at the very heart of decision making. We find ourselves forever overcapacity, which is a blessing and a curse as it shows the organization is getting value from our work, but clearly we need to find ways to scale as we can only do so much. Last year, for example, mid-pandemic we relaunched our internal insights hub and have since had thousands of employees take advantage of it. Next up we want to think more about the new sources of digital insight available to us and how that complements the traditional research methodologies we use. For example, we want to build Brandwatch dashboards connected via our APIs that can deliver real-time social data within our platform providing the right data at the right time to the right people. \nJR: DIY and agile seem to be the latest buzz words in market research.\u00c2\u00a0Has your Centre of Excellence structure allowed you to bring work in-house? AM: Yes and no. Some things we can do in-house and are doing more of. Our NPS program for example is pretty much run entirely in house, which is amazing given the size and the scale of the surveys that we run and the amount of data we collect. But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also say no in that there are some projects where we really value our research agency partners' perspectives and want them to challenge our thinking. BT has always been open to accepting that challenge. So while we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily run everything in house, in some ways it feels like we do because our research partners are an extension of our team and have supported us for a long time and therefore know us very well.\nJR: You mentioned NPS. Can you tell us about the program? AM: Sure, we run NPS monthly for our B2C and B2B customers. We relaunched the program a couple of years ago with the messaging that everyone in the business can own and impact this metric, regardless of role or level. We really wanted to emphasize that every customer touchpoint has a direct impact on this metric and therefore we all need to go the extra mile. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a core metric for us.\nJR: What type of research methodologies do you use? AM: It's a mix of qualitative and quantitative. From a qual perspective, we used to do a lot of face to face and focus groups before the lockdowns began and since then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve pivoted to virtual focus groups which have been eye-opening, to say the least and have allowed us to expand the types and locations of people we speak with. For example, last week I had a group that had someone from all four nations of the UK, which is the first time I can remember that. So I suspect even when things open up again, the virtual focus groups will be here to stay given their benefits in terms of panel diversity and flexibility. With respect to our quantitative studies, these can take a myriad of different forms from a very standard five minute online survey to a 20-minute in-person survey. We've got experts and specialists across these approaches.\nJR: And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your approach to collecting feedback across the customer journey? AM: We've invested a significant amount into automating feedback collection into our analysis process and therefore our market research engines. Building in customer trigger points is crucial for this, especially in our business where our customers have contracts with us. We think a lot about relationship stages and the right time to trigger various types of requests for feedback as we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to overburden our customers.\nJR: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read that survey participation rates are in decline. Is BT seeing this? AM: I can only speak about it from the surveys I run which are mainly in the realm of brand tracking, but yes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a significant decline in participation this past year, certainly in B2B more than B2C. It seems pretty understandable to me, given the circumstances of the past 12 months, that people don't want to be glued to their computer screens for any longer than they absolutely have to and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to think about completing surveys.\nSo it is a problem and we are thinking about the things we can do to change that, but certainly, the trend that we are seeing over the past five years is that attention spans are falling through the floor. And I think it's a really interesting dynamic now because you've got a generation of people that are going to be coming through, whether making decisions for themselves or for their companies, who have different approaches to engaging with brands. \nSo, how do you deal with that? How do you build a business that is going to allow you to gain information from your customers in a world like that? And that's when it gets really interesting in my space. How do you build a brand tracking questionnaire that was historically 25 minutes and now needs to be no longer than three and yet still provides the same level of value and insight to the business? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big challenge for sure. \nJR: Do you believe social can provide unique insight and pick up some of the slack? AM: It certainly adds another dimension to our understanding of customer needs and concerns. The verbatims we capture via surveys provide a lot of context and social for me is so important because it adds colour and context to these verbatims. So for example, if you see a sudden spike in negative NPS responses or brand tracking you can dive into those social comments and understand that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a network outage or perhaps a competitor has launched something new.\nI can remember a situation a few years back when we had a sudden spike in people complaining about mobile coverage at 10 am in the morning. Upon further analysis, we realized that a local morning television program had invited a money-saving expert as a guest and he told the viewers that if you complain about coverage and prices on a public forum such as Twitter, you might get a better deal. We actually found this out via our competitor monitoring program, as they were also seeing increased traffic. A powerful aspect of social data is the ability to analyze competitors, which we wouldn't have necessarily been able to do within brand tracking or other methods.\nJR: Can social augment or even replace brand tracking metrics? AM: The engagement our customers have with us on social media tends to be service driven and reactive rather than proactive, and so while it provides really helpful insight into the voice of the customer, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been difficult for us to correlate accurately with NPS. That said, we have managed to correlate social conversations with several of our other brand tracking metrics and will continue to look into this more.\nJR: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been BT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey with social intelligence to date? AM: It has definitely been a journey. Just before I joined the business in 2017, the group digital brand team was created and was asked to do a complete review of social including output, social care, everything. At that point we had nearly 400 branded social accounts across the group but no coordination in terms of their use of brand guidelines. In addition, some of these accounts had ad spend associated with them while others did not and some used third-party social tools while some published content natively. So in reality there was no consistent, coherent social strategy across the business and no visibility as to what was really going on. We were just sending social posts out into the ether which had the potential to be quite damaging reputationally.\nSo we had to educate our staff on what social could be, the importance of speaking with a unified voice, of measuring in a consistent way and of using the data to help us make better decisions across the business. And thankfully the business bought into the idea that social was so much more than funny cat memes. This allowed us to define a new social strategy with multiple stakeholders which we then launched as part of our B2C brand refresh in October 2019. We came out the back of this work with 12 strategic social accounts, all of which now had proper funding, performance management and KPIs. \nThe reason I tell you all of this is that a lot of the work we've done over the last four years has allowed us to build an understanding of 1) what social insight and social data can do and 2) how that links with digital insight and 3) how it provides a real time voice of the customer. It will never replace qualitative focus groups, if you want robust and reliable data you have to go with focus groups, but it can provide directional accuracy. People really started understanding the value of this when we stopped describing it as social listening and instead as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group. This change of language helped people make the connection to the world of research, making it more reputable. \nJR: Your team has many research methodologies at their disposal to get at consumer opinion. Where does social data fit into this and how is it being used today? AM: Even after the strides we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made the past few years, we are still at the very beginning of our work with social data. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone from just six users of social listening to over 400 staff who now have access to several social solutions depending on their role. So as we get more familiar with social data we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to do much more. But as for today, we lean on social data to help us do a great many things. Reputational insight for example is proving hugely valuable for us. We are also working with our customer care team on proactive care where there is a big opportunity to prevent churn and improve overall brand sentiment. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using social data to help with network outage detection and communication. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using it for audience analysis and to better understand how distinct groups think about our products. And finally, we are starting to use logo and image analysis as one input to identify sponsorship opportunities. So as you can see, a variety of use cases that add value across the business.\nJR: Final question then...what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superpower? AM:\u00c2\u00a0Its spontaneity, its real-time nature. The fact that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not forced, but unsolicited. People speak differently on social than they do to researchers so it provides a different way to understand consumers and their needs.\nJR: Many thanks for your time today Adam!\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nmarket research\nsocial intelligence\nsocial insights\nsocial listening\nvoice of the customer\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          \nWhy business IQ is not enough in the era of the relationship economy\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 14 February 2020\n          \nIs 2020 the year of prediction?\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 8 January 2020\n          "}

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why in 2020, we tested prompts that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply before they hit send.\nBased on feedback and learnings from those tests, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made improvements to the systems that decide when and how these reminders are sent. Starting today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling these improved prompts out across iOS and Android, starting with accounts that have enabled English-language settings.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow we got here\nWe began testing prompts last year that encouraged people to pause and reconsider a potentially harmful or offensive reply \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as insults, strong language, or hateful remarks \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before Tweeting it. Once prompted, people had an opportunity to take a moment and make edits, delete, or send the reply as is.\nIn early tests, people were sometimes prompted unnecessarily because the algorithms powering the prompts struggled to capture the nuance in many conversations and often didn't differentiate between potentially offensive language, sarcasm, and friendly banter. Throughout the experiment process, we analyzed results, collected feedback from the public, and worked to address our errors, including detection inconsistencies.\nThese tests ultimately resulted in people sending less potentially offensive replies across the service, and improved behavior on Twitter. We learned that:\u00c2\u00a0\nIf prompted, 34% of people revised their initial reply or decided to not send their reply at all.\nAfter being prompted once, people composed, on average, 11% fewer offensive replies in the future.\nIf prompted, people were less likely to receive offensive and harmful replies back.\nSince the early tests, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve incorporated into the systems that decide when and how to send these reminders:\nConsideration of the nature of the relationship between the author and replier, including how often they interact. For example, if two accounts follow and reply to each other often, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a higher likelihood that they have a better understanding of preferred tone of communication.\nAdjustments to our technology to better account for situations in which language may be reclaimed by underrepresented communities and used in non-harmful ways.\nImprovement to our technology to more accurately detect strong language, including profanity.\nCreated an easier way for people to let us know if they found the prompt helpful or relevant.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to explore how prompts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as reply prompts and article prompts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and other forms of intervention can encourage healthier conversations on Twitter. Our teams will also collect feedback from people on Twitter who have received reply prompts as we expand this feature to other languages.

For example, you told us you wanted more audience management controls, so we built them. You told us you wanted a way to show you are laughing during a Space, so we added an \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082 emoji.

Hosts put time and effort into creating space for conversation, connection and fun. Now, we're working on a way for hosts to be rewarded for the experiences they create by getting monetary support, while providing listeners with exclusive access to the conversations they care about most. Hosts can set ticket prices and how many are available to sell. A limited group will be able to host Ticketed Spaces in the coming months. Hosts earn the majority of the revenue from ticket sales and Twitter will keep a small amount as well. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSchedule and set reminders.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraging everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 prominent national reporters, journalism advocacy organizations, and everyday passionate news consumers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to share impactful examples of local journalism and elevate the reporters who contributed to it. The goal is to spotlight these reporters\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work and increase their audience.\nLocal Newspaper Ad Campaign\nTwitter is running an ad campaign in 28 local newspapers across the United States, including The Detroit Free Press, The Des Moines Register, The Miami Herald, and The Kansas City Star to support these outlets and amplify the #FollowLocalJournalists initiative. The ads, which will run in print and online, will direct readers to Twitter Lists of journalists created by each newspaper and by Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTune in on Spaces\nTwitter has organized Twitter Spaces around the world where people will be able to hear directly from journalists about the issues facing their industry, including:\nIn the Philippines, journalists from Rappler will host a Space focused on the idea that \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen journalists can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn Myanmar, the @ViceWorldNews team based across Southeast Asia will bring a group of Burmese journalists together to talk about #whatshappeninginmyanmar in the aftermath of the bloody coup there, and how so many journalists are risking their lives and freedom to tell this story.\nIn India, with journalists reporting from the frontlines of the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, newsrooms are facing incredible challenges. To discuss the impact of this crisis on the media, Twitter is hosting a Space for senior editors from across the country (Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Guwahati) in conversation with the Twitter India news team.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn Japan, @TwitterNewsJP is hosting two Spaces with journalists to discuss ways to support the needs of local news outlets, and the state of journalism nationally.\nIn Thailand, Sutichai Yoon is hosting a Space with local journalists to discuss what inspires and challenges them and how social media has impacted their work.\nIn Brazil, @Abraji and @RSF_pt is hosting a Space with five local journalism organizations focused on the state of journalism in Brazil.\nPartnership with UNESCO and NGOs working on protecting journalists\nTwitter has also continued our partnership with UNESCO this year to help drive conversation around World Press Freedom Day. We were proud to attend Asia Pacific Regional Consultation for World Press Freedom Day 2021 to discuss our commitment to a free press, and join UNESCO and global experts to discuss the role of technology in promoting media and information literacy. Together, we also launched Twitter emojis for the hashtags #FollowLocalJournalists, #WorldPressFreedomDay, #PressFreedom and #WPFD2021 in 20 languages.\nAdditionally, as a part of our commitment to freedom of expression and an open internet, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided trainings and Ads for good grants to non-profit organizations such as Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters sans fronti\u00c3\u00a8re, Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, Engage Media, and PEN America.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThroughout the year, #FollowLocalJournalists will be the theme of @TwitterNews\u00e2\u0080\u0099 events, trainings and advocacy work.

Today, we want to share more about the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing to improve our ML algorithms within Twitter, and our path forward through a company-wide initiative called Responsible ML. \nResponsible ML consists of the following pillars:\nTaking responsibility for our algorithmic decisions\nEquity and fairness of outcomes\nTransparency about our decisions and how we arrived at them\nEnabling agency and algorithmic choice\nResponsible technological use includes studying the effects it can have over time. When Twitter uses ML, it can impact hundreds of millions of Tweets per day and sometimes, the way a system was designed to help could start to behave differently than was intended. These subtle shifts can then start to impact the people using Twitter and we want to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re studying those changes and using them to build a better product.\u00c2\u00a0\nWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s involved and the actions we're taking\nTechnical solutions alone do not resolve the potential harmful effects of algorithmic decisions. Our Responsible ML working group is interdisciplinary and is made up of people from across the company, including technical, research, trust and safety, and product teams.\u00c2\u00a0\nLeading this work is our ML Ethics, Transparency and Accountability (META) team: a dedicated group of engineers, researchers, and data scientists collaborating across the company to assess downstream or current unintentional harms in the algorithms we use and to help Twitter prioritize which issues to tackle first.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re approaching this initiative:\nResearching and understanding the impact of ML decisions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re conducting in-depth analysis and studies to assess the existence of potential harms in the algorithms we use. Here are some analyses you will have access to in the upcoming months:\nA gender and racial bias analysis of our image cropping (saliency) algorithm\nA fairness assessment of our Home timeline recommendations across racial subgroups\nAn analysis of content recommendations for different political ideologies across seven countries\u00c2\u00a0\nApplying our learnings to improve Twitter. The most impactful applications of responsible ML will come from how we apply our learnings to build a better Twitter. The META team works to study how our systems work and uses those findings to improve the experience people have on Twitter. This may result in changing our product, such as removing an algorithm and giving people more control over the images they Tweet, or in new standards into how we design and build policies when they have an outsized impact on one particular community. The results of this work may not always translate into visible product changes, but it will lead to heightened awareness and important discussions around the way we build and apply ML.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also building explainable ML solutions so you can better understand our algorithms, what informs them, and how they impact what you see on Twitter. Similarly, algorithmic choice will allow people to have more input and control in shaping what they want Twitter to be for them. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently in the early stages of exploring this and will share more soon.\nSharing our learnings and asking for feedback. Both inside and outside of Twitter, we will share our learnings and best practices to improve the industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collective understanding of this topic, help us improve our approach, and hold us accountable. This may come in the form of peer-reviewed research, data-insights, high-level descriptions of our findings or approaches, and even some of our unsuccessful attempts to address these emerging challenges. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to work closely with third party academic researchers to identify ways we can improve our work and encourage their feedback.\nThe public plays a critical role in shaping Twitter and ResponsibleML is no different. Public feedback is particularly important as we assess the fairness and equity of the automated systems we use. Better, more informed decisions are made when the people who use Twitter are part of the process, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to create more opportunities for people to share their thoughts on how ML is used on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next?\u00c2\u00a0\nResponsible ML is a long journey in its early days. We want to explore it with a spirit of openness with the goal of contributing positively to the field of technology ethics. If you have any questions about Responsible ML, or the work META\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doing, feel free to ask us using #AskTwitterMETA.

To truly serve the public conversation, we must be more immersed in the rich and vibrant communities that drive the conversations taking place every day across the African continent.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are looking for specialists to join several teams including product, design, engineering, marketing and communications. Full details on current job openings can be found on the Twitter Careers site. Aligned with our existing WFH policies, we look forward to welcoming and onboarding our new team members remotely so that we can make an immediate impact while we explore the opportunity to open an office in Ghana in the future.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhy Ghana?\nAs a champion for democracy, Ghana is a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate. Furthermore, Ghana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent appointment to host The Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area aligns with our overarching goal to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhenever we enter new markets, we work hard to ensure that we are not just investing in the talent that we hire, but also investing in local communities and the social fabric that supports them. We have already laid foundations through partnerships with Amref Health Africa in Kenya,\u00c2\u00a0Afrochella in Ghana, Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) in Nigeria, and The HackLab Foundation in Ghana. As part of our long-term commitment to the region, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to explore compelling ways we can use the positive power of Twitter to strengthen our communities through employee engagement, platform activation, and corporate giving.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe still have much to learn but we are excited to listen, learn, and engage.

And Twitter is the place where people go to talk about their passions and interests, especially when it comes to good eats.\nWe teamed up with Brandwatch, a pioneering digital consumer intelligence company, to uncover top consumer trends around food alternatives by looking at share of voice. To do this, Brandwatch observed a random smaller sample (33%) of the overall conversation on Twitter from 2019 to 2020.\u00c2\u00a0 Read on for the top consumer trends they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re picking up around food alternatives.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n01 #TrendyDiets\nAs veganism and vegetarianism continue to dominate online conversations, two trends within these categories have surfaced: eating for awareness and eating for a higher purpose. These purpose-driven trends are priming consumers to look for ways they can take responsibility for the impact of their food choices.\nEating for awareness is seen in popular trends like Veganuary, which encouraged people to commit to veganism for the month of January. And considering everyone loves a good challenge, Veganuary commanded attention.\nEating for a higher purpose cropped up throughout popular discussions on Twitter, as users challenged each other to think beyond the individual by choosing a vegan diet to help reduce our carbon footprint.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n02 #MindfulMilk\nAlternative options for milk are extremely popular and include a wide range of choices for consumers. But what about them is driving interest?\nTo a large extent, the discussions around dairy alternatives have a lot to do with sustainability \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but not in the way you might expect. In fact, conversations have surfaced environmental concerns within the alternatives themselves, revealing both interest and debate.\nIn that context, one milk alternative has pulled away from the pack. Oat milk saw the largest growth in online discussions (an increase of 66% YoY). Meanwhile, other milk alternatives have maintained some relevance, gaining traction in commentary around hugely popular recipes like overnight oats.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n03 #MeatlessMeat\nWhen it comes to choices around meat substitutions, trends like #MeatlessMondays are leaving plenty on the bone.\u00c2\u00a0 Consumers can now enjoy a variety of meat alternatives while enjoying favorite snacks like jerky, crisps, and more. In fact, popular meat-free ingredients like tofu, jackfruit, seitan, tempeh, and pea protein have even made their way into beloved desserts like brownies. Pea protein in particular has seen a 42% increase YoY in its share of voice.\nAnd as meatless meal options are proliferating, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also speeding up\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is to say that fast food outlets are talking up their own branded meat alternatives, offering new vegan and vegetarian options to mainstream markets.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n04 #SuperFoods\u00c2\u00a0\nSuperfoods are healthy ingredients packed with vitamins, minerals, and plenty to talk about on Twitter. Everyone already loves avocados, a superfood powerhouse, which is now almost an essential ingredient to premium salads, tacos, and (of course) toast.\u00c2\u00a0 Blueberries were often included in conversations surrounding cakes, oatmeals, and pancakes. Meanwhile,\u00c2\u00a0 ginger, kale, chia, matcha, and acai berries were mentioned around juicing.\nIn short, superfoods have shown supergrowth. Take flax, for example, whose share of voice has seen an increase of 991% year over year! Other options like matcha have grown by 74% compared to last year.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n05 #CrunchyCravings\nNo food discussion would be complete without a bag of chips, and chips are seeing a rise in popularity too.\nVegetable and legume-based crisps like lentils, kale, and sweet potato have some major buzz. Air fryers are currently in the spotlight, which are becoming known for their ability to make delicious kale chips. Their overall share of voice went up 24% year over year.\nThe benefits of rice crackers have become a popular topic too, with a share of voice that went up 19% year over year.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFood brings people together and so does Twitter.

Over the years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been open about our work and where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making an impact - from our quarterly I&D Reports that highlight our commitments to inclusion and diversity, to our Transparency Reports which reflect our work to protect the integrity of the conversation on Twitter.\nThis report aims to bring these and other initiatives together in one place, showcasing Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work across corporate responsibility, sustainability, and philanthropy. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big step in our commitment to sharing more about the work we know is important to the people we serve - from our employees, or Tweeps, to partners, investors and the people around the world who use Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor our 2020 report, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve organized our work into five key areas:\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nOur service: Earning trust is one of our core operating principles, and it begins with how we act. We want people to have safe, inclusive and authentic conversations on Twitter, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to promote healthy conversations on our service while continuing to grow our audience and our business in socially responsible ways.\nGovernance: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to sound corporate governance, strong ethics and compliance practices, which promote the long-term interests of the diverse communities we serve and help build public trust in Twitter.\nPeople and culture: We often say that\u00e2\u0080\u008b Tweeps come for the purpose and stay for the people, along with the unique experience and knowledge gained from working at Twitter. This includes building a company and culture that reflects the incredibly vibrant and diverse conversations happening on our service every day.\nTwitter for Good: Strengthening our communities is core to our social impact philosophy. Our goal is to bring our company and community together as a positive societal force around the world.\nPlanet: Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to protecting the environment, reducing our carbon footprint, and fostering long-term sustainability projects to play our part.\nOur hope is that by presenting and organizing our work in this way, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to clearly showcase what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done and provide a roadmap of where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re headed.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPDF\n2020 Global Impact Report\nView our full report\nDownload\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made an impact - both as a company and as a service supporting the public conversation.

Overwhelmed by the increasing number of requests for feedback, consumers are avoiding surveys all together which is impacting response rates. The telephone survey, for example, has seen a steep decline in response rates since the mid-90s, dropping from 36% in 1997 to just 6% in 2018, according to Pew Research1. Of course, many variables are at play when it comes to response rates across different types of surveys, but the reality is that survey fatigue is real and it impacts both the volume and quality of feedback received. The insight they provide is also limited to the questions asked. So, is there another way?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nI recently ran an experiment to understand if insights from Tweets could answer many of the same questions that customer surveys commonly ask. To do this I chose a consumer-focused industry\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094airline travel\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094and focused on a specific carrier (who shall remain anonymous). Given the disruption to the industry brought on by COVID-19, I chose to analyse the month of January 2020, as this was one of the last few months of unaffected travel. \nIn January 2020 alone, the airline was mentioned 70,000 times on Twitter which provided a large amount of content to sift through. In particular, I was looking for Tweets from travellers sharing their preflight, inflight and postflight experiences and was guided by the topics that bubbled to the surface organically. Here are some examples of what I found:\nPreflight Experience\nCheck-in: 567 mentions including app check-in, visa checks and bag drop\nLounge: 443 mentions including food quality, shower cleanliness and staffing\nBoarding: 223 mentions including express boarding and shuttle buses\nInflight Experience\nWiFi: 34 mentions of connectivity issues or lack of service\nEntertainment system: 27 mentions of small or dirty video screens\nFood quality: 372 mentions including lack of vegan options, pricing and selection\nPostflight Experience\nBaggage collection: 374 mentions including delayed, lost and damaged baggage\nLoyalty program: 438 mentions of air mile collection and usage policies\nCompensation claims: 131 mentions of confusing rules\nThese comments alone constituted nearly 2,600 pieces of customer feedback covering the entire customer journey\u00e2\u0081\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094insights that the airline could potentially use to improve the experience for all passengers. Crucially, they uncovered specific pieces of feedback that might not normally be surfaced by surveys due to the limitations of the questions asked. For example:\nDepartures check-in: One person lamented that her elderly parent struggled to follow the prompts on the check-in kiosks.\nOnboard WiFi purchase: One traveller asked why there was no pay-as-you-go option.\nOnboard electrical plugs: Several travellers mentioned the placement and number of electrical plugs and some even provided suggestions on where they should be placed.\nMeal choices: Several passengers expressed their annoyance that gluten-free meal options had to be pre-ordered.\nThis analysis did not attempt to create a representative sample of customer views nor to draw any type of causal relationship between these comments and overall satisfaction with the airline. I simply set out to prove that the breadth and depth of conversations happening on Twitter can provide a real-time voice of the customer at every touchpoint in the customer journey.\nThe findings suggest that insights from Twitter can indeed shed light on many facets of the customer experience, providing a unique window into real observed human behaviours with several advantages over traditional insight gathering techniques.\nFirst, the unsolicited nature of Twitter feedback circumvents one of the biggest challenges of research\u00e2\u0080\u0094the introduction of bias by the questions being asked. Secondly, as Tweets are sent at the moment people are actually having the experience, they tend to be more emotive as a result and represent a more authentic view of a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true feelings. This is much different than being asked to recount your experience with the onboard WiFi a few days later via an email prompted survey. At that point, the moment is gone and you might not even bother to respond. This strength of social data should not be underestimated, for very little market research delivered today is conducted with the context in mind.\nAnd finally, the open, continuous nature of Twitter allows you to see trends emerge over time and benchmark yourself against your competitors. It also has the advantage of allowing you to go back and analyze a topic retrospectively, uncovering feedback preserved in time, forever.\nCustomer experience measurement has come a long way over the past few years as new technologies and techniques have emerged to ascertain consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 true feelings. The reality is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just one approach that will provide the insight organizations need but rather a combination of many, used at the right time and leveraging their respective data gathering strengths. Insights from Twitter won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully replace surveys, but they can complement them, providing context to common metrics such as NPS while helping to focus the questions you do want to ask of your customers. Perhaps Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest strength then is in providing answers to the questions you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even think to ask.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nInterested to learn more about how Twitter can support your customer feedback initiatives?

And, should a world leader violate a rule, what type of enforcement action is appropriate.\nStarting on March 19, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be calling for responses to a public survey that will help inform the development of our policy framework. The questionnaire will be available in the coming days in 14 languages:\nArabic\nChinese (Simplified, Traditional)\nEnglish\nFarsi\nFilipino\nFrench\nHindi\nIndonesian\nJapanese\nKorean\nPortuguese\nRussian\nSpanish\nUrdu\nThis is to ensure a global perspective is reflected in the feedback and mirrors the approach we've taken with previous public surveys. The survey will close on Monday, April 12 at 5 p.m. PT. \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also in the process of consulting with a range of human rights experts, civil society organizations, and academics worldwide whose feedback will be reflected in forthcoming revisions to the policy framework.\nWe want to serve the public conversation and allow the public to hear from and engage with leaders around the world. Ultimately, our aim is to have a policy that appropriately balances fundamental human rights and considers the global context in which we operate.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe welcome your feedback and will keep you updated.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npolicy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

In parallel, we have also been focused on attaining another global brand safety accreditation, and on providing advertisers with more control over the conversations they start on Twitter. We are excited to share two updates on this front:\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter receives global Brand Safety certification through TAG\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share that Twitter has successfully earned the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) Brand Safety Certified Seal, which covers Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global operations*.\nTAG is a leading global certification program fighting criminal activity and increasing trust in the digital advertising industry. TAG advances its mission of eliminating fraudulent traffic, facilitating the sharing of threat intelligence and promoting brand safety by connecting industry leaders, analyzing threats and sharing best practices worldwide.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe TAG Brand Safety Certified program sets global brand safety standards that apply to digital advertising agreements, monetized content takedown practices, the use of inclusion/exclusion lists, and the documentation of specific policies and procedures used to minimize the risk of ad misplacement. These standards impact direct buyers, direct sellers and intermediaries. This certification affords advertisers and agencies the assurance that Twitter has been independently audited to ensure compliance with TAG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidelines. Our partnership with TAG supplements our ongoing work with the MRC, and further reinforces our commitment to independent brand safety accreditation. Learn more about program requirements here.\nTwitter earned its first brand safety accreditation in 2019, when Twitter UK became certified through JICWEBS\u00e2\u0080\u0099 DTSG Good Practice Principles. Last September, JICWEBS merged with TAG in order to create a global certification for brand safety, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been actively working with TAG over the past several months to extend Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s TAG Brand Safety Certification to cover our global operations. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to have been among the first companies to attain TAG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Brand Safety Certification, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to expand that certification globally today.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn our global ad supply chain, threats to brand safety can extend across oceans and borders. By achieving the TAG Brand Safety Certified Seal for its global operations. Twitter is helping lead the industry in tackling those complicated global challenges. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Twitter to raise the bar on brand safety across our industry.\nMike Zaneis\nCEO of TAG\nIntroducing Conversation Settings for advertisers\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best place to have conversations with the people that matter most to brands, but we know that sometimes advertisers may need more control over the conversations they have with their customers. That is why we have made it easier for brands to curate their conversations with the introduction of conversation settings for ads.\nIn August 2020, we made new conversation settings available to everyone on Twitter, allowing people to have more control over the conversations they start. Now, we are making these capabilities available to all advertisers when they compose Tweets directly through Tweet Composer or through our Ads API. This update will extend the ability to apply conversation settings to Promoted-only Tweets and to those that use our most popular ad formats, in addition to organic Tweets. You can learn more about how this works here.\nWe are committed to continuing the work on our ongoing brand safety efforts, and will continue to lead with policy, protect with product, and drive industry-wide change through partnerships. We look forward to sharing more updates as we move along.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n*Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s policies and procedures for minimizing ad misplacement were independently audited and deemed compliant with the TAG Certified for Brand Safety Guidelines Version 1.0.

Starting today, we will begin applying labels to Tweets that may contain misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines, in addition to our continued efforts to remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information from the service. Since introducing our COVID-19 guidance, we have removed more than 8,400 Tweets and challenged 11.5 million accounts worldwide.\nWe are also introducing a strike system that determines when further enforcement action is necessary. We believe the strike system will help to educate the public on our policies and further reduce the spread of potentially harmful and misleading information on Twitter, particularly for repeated moderate and high-severity violations of our rules.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Example of COVID-19 misinformation label\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nEnforcement details:\u00c2\u00a0\nLabels will first be applied by our team members when they determine content violates our policy. Those assessments will be used to further inform our automated tools and to advance our proactive capacity to identify and label similar content across the service. Our goal is to eventually use both automated and human review to address content that violates our COVID-19 vaccine misinformation rules. Machine-learning and automated language processing takes time to be effective. As such, we will begin with English-language content first and use this same process as we work to expand to other languages and cultural contexts over time.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nLabels will appear in your set display language and may link to curated content and official public health information or the Twitter Rules. Our goal with these product interventions is to provide people with additional context and authoritative information about COVID-19.\nThrough the use of the strike system, we hope to educate people on why certain content breaks our rules so they have the opportunity to further consider their behavior and their impact on the public conversation. This strike system is similar to our recent update to the Civic Integrity Policy. Individuals will be notified directly when a label or required Tweet removal results in additional account-level enforcement. Repeated violations of the COVID-19 policy are enforced against on the basis of the number of strikes an account has accrued for violations of the policy.\nOne strike: no account-level action\nTwo strikes: 12-hour account lock\nThree strikes: 12-hour account lock \nFour strikes: 7-day account lock \nFive or more strikes: permanent suspension\nAs always, if you believe that your account was locked or suspended in error, you can submit an appeal.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Example of COVID-19 misinformation label with engagements limited\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nPartnerships:\nWe are not only focused on enforcing the Twitter Rules, but also helping people find credible health information and partnering with the experts.

This means when someone searches for COVID-19, they are met with credible, authoritative content at the very top of their search experience. This has been expanded to over 80 countries worldwide and is currently available in 29 languages. In some countries the prompts now also include an additional button which links to COVID-19 vaccine specific information.\nPro bono advertising.\u00c2\u00a0Through our Ads for Good grants, we continue to partner with nonprofits and NGOs around the world to elevate authoritative information on COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve supported these efforts across more than 35 countries on a pro bono basis. In addition, we have donated premium advertising products, including Promoted Trend and\u00c2\u00a0First View\u00c2\u00a0products, to elevate critical public health information such as @FEMA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message about the agency's vaccination efforts and emergency relief locations during winter storms.\nGlobal cooperation.\u00c2\u00a0In February 2021, we participated in a global WHO policy consultation to present Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views on finding and implementing \u00e2\u0080\u009cinnovative ways and best practices to address health misinformation in the social media sector.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We continue to host a weekly live Q&A\u00c2\u00a0event page\u00c2\u00a0for the WHO at #AskWHO. \nAddressing public questions on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0This month, we facilitated a\u00c2\u00a0Twitter Q&A\u00c2\u00a0from\u00c2\u00a0@WHCOVIDResponse.

In India, we worked with the Ministry of Health to organize Vaccine Vartha, a weekly expert talk hosted on Twitter that enables vaccine experts to answer citizen questions.\u00c2\u00a0\nEncouraging healthy conversation.\u00c2\u00a0In January, in partnership with\u00c2\u00a0Team Halo,\u00c2\u00a0UNICEF,\u00c2\u00a0NHS, and\u00c2\u00a0the Vaccine Confidence Project, we activated an emoji hashtag #vaccinated to show support for vaccination.

Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding these accounts to the archive to empower independent research and analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 \nArmenia\u00c2\u00a0\nUnder our platform manipulation policy, we investigated and removed 35 accounts that had ties to the Government of Armenia. These accounts were created in order to advance narratives that were targeting Azerbaijan and were geostrategically favorable to the Armenian government. In some cases, the fake accounts purported to represent government and political figures in Azerbaijan, as well as news entities claiming to operate in Azerbaijan. The accounts engaged in spammy activity to gain followers and further amplify this narrative.\nRussia \nToday we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing two separate networks that have Russian ties.\n1.\u00c2\u00a0Our first investigation found and removed a network of 69 fake accounts that can be reliably tied to Russian state actors. A number of these accounts amplified narratives that were aligned with the Russian government, while another subset of the network focused on undermining faith in the NATO alliance and its stability.\n2.\u00c2\u00a0As part of our second investigation in this region, we removed 31 accounts from two networks that show signs of being affiliated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and Russian government-linked actors. These accounts amplified narratives that had been previously associated with the IRA and other Russian influence efforts targeting the United States and European Union.\nOur work in this area\u00c2\u00a0\nWith every disclosure we make, we want to continue to educate people on the tactics used by state actors in order to manipulate or undermine the open democratic conversation that happens on Twitter.

We believe that safety and free expression go hand-in-hand, especially when interacting with these leaders and associated institutions, and adding context to what people see on Twitter helps them have a more informed experience on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn August 2020, we expanded account labels to two additional categories: 1) the accounts of key government officials and 2) accounts belonging to state-affiliated media entities. Included in this initial action were accounts from countries represented in the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.\u00c2\u00a0\nAfter receiving feedback on this initial action from a range of stakeholders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including civil society, academia, and those who use our service \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on Wednesday, February 17, we will expand these labels to accounts from Group of Seven (G7) countries, and to a majority of countries that Twitter has attributed state-linked information operations to. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also apply labels to the personal accounts of heads of state for these countries.\nHere is the full phased plan:\nPhase 1 Countries (August 2020) China, France, Russian Federation, United Kingdom, and United States\nPhase 2 Countries (February 17, 2021) Canada, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Honduras, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates\nWe will add labels to the following categories of Twitter accounts:\nVerified accounts of key government officials, including foreign ministers, institutional entities, ambassadors, official spokespeople, and key diplomatic leaders. At this time, our focus is on senior officials and entities who are the official voice of the state abroad;\nPersonal accounts of heads of state, from phase 1 and phase 2 countries.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also updating the label text to add more specificity to the government account labels by differentiating between individuals and institutions, and expanding labels to the personal accounts of heads of state to give people on Twitter additional context.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs the next phase of this project, we will work to apply additional labels on state-affiliated media accounts over the next several months, taking an iterative approach to ensure we capture all relevant accounts.\nOur principled approach\nOur mission is to serve the public conversation and an important part of that work is providing people with context so they can make informed decisions about what they see and how they engage on Twitter. Twitter provides an unmatched way to connect with and directly speak to public officials and representatives.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow do we define government accounts for these new labels?\nOur focus is on senior officials, heads of state, and institutions that are the voice of the nation state abroad, specifically the account categories listed above. We believe this is an important step so that when people see an account discussing geopolitical issues from another country, they have context on its national affiliation, and are better informed about who they represent. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also focused on those within the respective administrations underneath the head of state that offer its policy perspective abroad.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo offer even more context to the public, clicking on a label directs people to this article explaining the policy and referring them to the Twitter Transparency Report for additional information.\nNotification and appeals process\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter notifies accounts when they receive a label, and account owners can communicate with Twitter directly if they have feedback.\nNext steps\nThe immediate next phase will be to apply these labels to state-affiliated media entities of these phase two countries. Beyond this, we will continue expanding labels to additional countries over time and look forward to providing additional updates as those plans take shape.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Today we\u00c2\u00a0 join safety partners from over 140 countries to mark #SaferInternetDay2021 and play our part in creating a safer internet for all.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo celebrate the global conversation around Internet safety, we launched a special emoji that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activated by using the hashtags #SaferInternetDay\u00c2\u00a0and #SID2021. The emoji helps to unify and strengthen the conversation on Twitter, around Safer Internet Day.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe theme for Safer Internet Day 2021 (@safeinternetday), \u00e2\u0080\u0098Together for a better Internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 speaks to a set of beliefs we share as an online service: that the Internet can always be better, that it remains a force for good, and that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all of our jobs to make it safe and healthy. We all contribute, we all have our part to play.\nThe safety of Twitter and the health of the public conversation is one of our highest priorities. In the last year, we have made strides in tackling abusive content on our service globally and have seen a 105% increase in accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules).\u00c2\u00a0\nThere will always be more to do, but we have made meaningful progress.\u00c2\u00a0\nCOVID-19: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\nAs the world faced the COVID-19 pandemic, people turned to Twitter to discuss what was happening and find the latest authoritative public health information.\nIn March 2020, we launched a COVID-19 misleading information policy to protect the health of the public conversation.Since then, our teams have removed 8,493 Tweets and our automated systems have challenged 11.5 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors.\nIn order to bring awareness to gender-based violence as cases surged during the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cshadow pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u009d, Twitter has supported nonprofit partners globally by providing Ads for Good grants.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn September 2020, around World Suicide Prevention Day, we worked with the International Association for Suicide Prevention to amplify #SuicidePrevention resources with over 20 NGOs globally.\nIn December 2020, we expanded the COVID-19 misleading information policy to address Tweets that contain potentially harmful misleading information about COVID-19 vaccines.\n#ThereIsHelp\nTwitter partners with authorities and nonprofit organizations around the world on our #ThereIsHelp notification service. This service provides resources to vulnerable people and encourages them to reach out and get support when people search certain terms on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis year we expanded the prompts to several new markets in consultation with global and local partners to ensure that we are sharing the latest and most helpful resources in our #ThereisHelp prompts across the globe. We expanded this service to provide information on gender-based violence in 24 markets and on suicide or self harm in 30 markets.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nExpaning our policies\u00c2\u00a0\nThroughout 2020, we updated our rules against Hateful Conduct, to prohibit language that dehumanizes people on the basis of age, disability, disease, race, ethnicity, national origin as well as to include abusive language promoting \u00e2\u0080\u009cconversion therapy\u00e2\u0080\u009d targeting individuals or the entire LGBTQ+ community.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe expanded our policies to further protect the civic conversation: Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is to further protect against content that could suppress the vote and help stop the spread of harmful misinformation that could compromise the integrity of an election or other civic process.\nThe work we do in order to make Twitter safer, must be done in collaboration with our safety partners around the world -\u00c2\u00a0 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why taking part in #SaferInternetDay2021 is key for us. Across the world today and throughout February, we will work with and support our network of safety partners to amplify their guidance, provide Ads for Good grants to elevate their voices and support their campaigns, and collaborate together on helping shape a better Internet. Across 4 continents, we will run safety training, deliver presentations and participate in events to commemorate the day.\nIn Europe, we will be participating in the Safer Internet Day event organised by the European Commission with Better Internet for Kids Youth Ambassadors, and on February 24th we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be running a Youth Summit event to promote a safer internet for all citizens, especially young people, as well as to to empower young people to talk about topics that matter to them.\nAlso in Europe, we have partnered with Maldita.es, an independent and non-profit organization focused on fact-checking techniques, on a week-long course on Twitter, specifically designed to educate young people on becoming critical thinkers and identifying misinformation. The course will be available in English through @maldita_es and will be localized in Spain through their @MalditaEduca. It will also be localized in Germany through @correctiv_org within the next weeks. We provided Ads for good for all partners.\nIn the UK, Safer Internet Day 2021 will be celebrated with the theme, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAn Internet we trust: exploring reliability in the online world\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The Internet has an amazing range of information and opportunities online. This year, in the UK, Safer Internet Day aims to explore how we can separate fact from fiction when online. We have provided Ads for Good to the UK Safer Internet Centre, which is made up of organisations including Childnet International, Internet Watch Foundation and South West Grid for Learning, in order to help support their work toward a better internet for all.\nIn Spain, we have partnered with and provided Ads For Good to PantallasAmigas on the joint campaign with Fundaci\u00c3\u00b3n Mapfre to educate young people on Internet Safety. We will also be participating in the Safer Internet Day event organized by INCIBE, specifically in the session \u00e2\u0080\u009cFavoring safe and positive digital experiences\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn MENA, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be running an online safety workshop with the UAE TRA Virtual Academy. This partnership is an opportunity to educate the audience on multiple elements of online and Internet safety, ranging from digital footprint controls to media information literacy and security best practices. We also aim to create an open dialogue to discuss the Twitter Rules and provide feedback on our global efforts to create a safer Internet for everyone.\nIn the United States, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve issued #AdsForGood grants to partners across the country to help people thrive in a digital world. Through these investments, we will amplify conversations to educate families, schools, and young people to support their online safety, privacy, and security.\nIn Spanish Speaking LatAm, @TwitterLatam will hold a virtual Twitter for Nonprofits workshop focused on Safety and Security. In this training we will discuss the Twitter Rules and enforcement, reporting channels, tools that people have to control their experience on Twitter, and account security best practices.\nIn Thailand, we will host a virtual panel discussion on Twitter to raise awareness on internet safety and promote media literacy with our NGO partners @HugProjectTH, @EcpatFoundation, and @saidek1387 (Childline Thailand). We provided #AdsForGood for all partners. The session will be moderated by Hug Project.

Lockdowns imposed around the world have brought significant pain to the sector and most have struggled to make up revenue shortfalls online. And as we look to vaccinations as the path back to normality, it's unclear how many small businesses will survive that long. A recent McKinsey study found that more than half of the 2,200 small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) they surveyed across Europe felt their businesses may not survive longer than 12 months. Meanwhile, in the US, 59% of small businesses surveyed in a Goldman Sachs study reported a negative revenue impact from the pandemic. Considering that SMBs employ just under half of the US workforce1 and two-thirds of Europe's2, you quickly see the importance of this sector to the wider economy.\nEven before the pandemic, small businesses in numerous industries were struggling to compete against the industry goliaths, who used their scale, technology and access to capital to muscle into new markets and keep upstarts out of theirs. Incumbency has therefore proven a powerful thing: it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no wonder the rate of new business creation has been in decline for decades and is at its lowest level since the late \u00e2\u0080\u009870s.3 And due to successive waves of mergers, some industries have never been more concentrated. The pandemic could accelerate this consolidation, making it even tougher for small businesses to succeed. \nDavid vs. Goliath \nFaced with these two existential threats, what can small businesses do to compete in what feels like a David vs. Goliath world? From my perspective, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really all about the customer. In a world where it's increasingly difficult to differentiate on product or service features, price or quality, customer experience is one of the main ways you can stand out in the crowd.\nBy focusing on listening to and understanding your customers you can build loyalty while identifying new opportunities to serve them. How? By listening. Your customers, prospective customers, and competitors are sharing their experiences, feedback and ideas openly on social media every day. And due to its open nature, Twitter is a great place to both connect with your customers and learn more about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to them.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nJust about anything and everything is shared on Twitter, from the trendy to the mundane, often answering questions you didn't think to ask. This hints at an important characteristic of Twitter data: unsolicited opinions and feedback shared by consumers in the moment they are actually having that experience. These perspectives are unfiltered, raw and emotional, shedding light on underlying motivations, emerging behaviors and new norms. Surveys can be helpful, but they are guided by the questions asked and it can be a struggle to get people to complete them. Social listening on the other hand allows you to instantly tap into millions of conversations on topics important to your business. We like to think of it as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group. \nHow to get started? \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been easier to tap into the public conversation on Twitter to support your business\u00e2\u0080\u0099s growth. Social media management tools such as Sprout Social, a Twitter Official Partner, make it easy to deliver social customer service and listen to customers for ideas on how to improve your products or services while gathering inspiration for new ones. From the florist to the pharmacist and the retailer to the restaurateur, small businesses of all shapes and sizes can gather insights that help move themselves forward. And as we enter 2021 with the hope of recovery on the horizon, investing in market awareness is a truly wise investment, which just might help some of the Davids out there take on their Goliaths.\nLooking to get inspired?

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where writers, experts and curators \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from individual creators to journalists to publishers themselves \u00e2\u0080\u0093 go to share their written work, spark meaningful conversations and build a loyal following. These writers and long-form content curators are a valuable part of the conversation and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical we offer new ways for them to create and share their content, and importantly, help them grow and better connect with their audience.\nTo jumpstart our efforts, Twitter has acquired Revue, a service that makes it free and easy for anyone to start and publish editorial newsletters. Revue will accelerate our work to help people stay informed about their interests while giving all types of writers a way to monetize their audience \u00e2\u0080\u0093 whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s through the one they built at a publication, their website, on Twitter, or elsewhere.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Compose a newsletter quickly and easily in Revue. Drag links, videos, and Tweets into the issue.\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nSupporting writers across our service\nWith a robust community of writers and readers, Twitter is uniquely positioned to help organizations and writers grow their readership faster and at a much larger scale than anywhere else. Many established writers and publishers have built their brand on Twitter, amassing an audience that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hungry for the next article or perspective they Tweet. Our goal is to make it easy for them to connect with their subscribers, while also helping readers better discover writers and their content. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re imagining a lot of ways to do this, from allowing people to sign up for newsletters from their favorite follows on Twitter, to new settings for writers to host conversations with their subscribers. It will all work seamlessly within Twitter.\nAnd for those looking to generate revenue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re creating a durable incentive model through paid newsletters. Bringing Revue to Twitter will supercharge this offering, helping writers grow their paid subscribers while also incentivizing them to produce engaging and relevant content that drives conversations on Twitter. You can expect audience-based monetization to be an area that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to develop new ways to support, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helping broaden revenue streams or serving as a cornerstone of someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Audience insights by Revue.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also expanding their team and hiring for key roles across engineering, design, research and data science. Over time, this team will build more discovery, reading, and conversational experiences centered around long-form content on Twitter.\nThis is just the first step for us as we continue to enhance the public conversation on Twitter, and we welcome all creators \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from experts and curators to journalists and publishers \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to join us on our journey.

We apply labels and add context to Tweets, but we don't want to limit efforts to circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention. We also want to broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem, and we believe a community-driven approach can help. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why today we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing Birdwatch, a pilot in the US of a new community-driven approach to help address misleading information on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works\nBirdwatch allows people to identify information in Tweets they believe is misleading and write notes that provide informative context. We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable. Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.\nIn this first phase of the pilot, notes will only be visible on a separate Birdwatch site. On this site, pilot participants can also rate the helpfulness of notes added by other contributors. These notes are being intentionally kept separate from Twitter for now, while we build Birdwatch and gain confidence that it produces context people find helpful and appropriate. Additionally, notes will not have an effect on the way people see Tweets or our system recommendations.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nBuilding together\u00c2\u00a0\nTo date, we have conducted more than 100 qualitative interviews with individuals across the political spectrum who use Twitter, and we received broad general support for Birdwatch. In particular, people valued notes being in the community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice (rather than that of Twitter or a central authority) and appreciated that notes provided useful context to help them better understand and evaluate a Tweet (rather than focusing on labeling content as\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrue\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalse\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Our goal is to build Birdwatch in the open, and have it shaped by the Twitter community.\nTo that end, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent:\u00c2\u00a0\nAll data contributed to Birdwatch will be publicly available and downloadable in TSV files\u00c2\u00a0\nAs we develop algorithms that power Birdwatch \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as reputation and consensus systems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we aim to publish that code publicly in the Birdwatch Guide. The initial ranking system for Birdwatch is already available here.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe hope this will enable experts, researchers, and the public to analyze or audit Birdwatch, identifying opportunities or flaws that can help us more quickly build an effective community-driven solution.\nWe want to invite anyone to sign up and participate in this program, and know that the broader and more diverse the group, the better Birdwatch will be at effectively addressing misinformation. More details on how to apply here.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\nWe know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot.\nFrom embedding a member of the University of Chicago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Center for RISC on our team to hosting feedback sessions with experts in a variety of disciplines, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also reaching beyond our virtual walls and integrating social science and academic perspectives into the development of Birdwatch.\nWe know this might be messy and have problems at times, but we believe this is a model worth trying. We invite you to learn alongside as we continue to explore different ways of addressing a common problem.

As Twitter will serve as both a venue for people to watch and talk about this political event, and play a key role in facilitating the transfer of official government communication channels, we want to be transparent and clear about what people should expect to see on the platform.\nProtecting the public conversation \nIn our January 12 update following the riots in Washington, DC, we outlined the steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to protect the public conversation on Twitter from attempts to incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome. These efforts, including our open lines of communication with law enforcement, will continue through the inauguration and will adapt as needed if circumstances change in real-time.\nWatching Inauguration 2021 live\nPeople on Twitter will be able to watch the inauguration ceremony and the coverage surrounding it via live streams from multiple news outlets and official inauguration feeds, including @JCCIC and @BidenInaugural, through Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s US Elections Hub.\nAlongside the livestream of inauguration events, the hub will also include curated Moments, Lists and accounts-to-follow recommendations from trusted and official sources.\nTransferring Institutional White House Twitter accounts\nAs we did in 2017, Twitter is actively working with the US government to support the archival and transition of Twitter accounts across administrations.\nAs President-elect Biden is sworn in on January 20, 2021, Twitter will facilitate the transfer of institutional White House Twitter accounts, including: @WhiteHouse, @POTUS, @VP, @FLOTUS, and @PressSec.\nFirst, Twitter will transfer current institutional accounts to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) where the Tweets and account history will remain publicly available and the account usernames will be updated to reflect their archived status. For example, the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @POTUS account will be publicly archived as @POTUS45, just as the Obama administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account was archived as @POTUS44.\nOnce this archival process is completed, Twitter will transfer the institutional accounts to the Biden administration to assume ownership, along with a new account: @SecondGentleman.\nPeople on Twitter will be able to watch the transition of power take place in real-time as accounts for the White House, President, Vice President, First Lady and White House Press Secretary inherit their new institutional usernames: @Transition46 will become @WhiteHouse, @PresElectBiden will become @POTUS, @SenKamalaHarris will become @VP, @FLOTUSBiden will become @FLOTUS, and @PressSecPsaki will become @PressSec. The Tweets, account history, and followers will transition between these accounts.\nThese institutional accounts will not automatically retain the followers from the prior administration. People on Twitter who previously followed institutional White House Twitter accounts, or who currently follow relevant Biden or Harris Twitter accounts, will receive in-app alerts and other prompts that will notify them about the archival process, as well as give them the option to follow the new administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter accounts. The new institutional accounts will also be listed in Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s US Elections Hub during the presidential inauguration.\nYou can follow along with @TwitterGov, @Policy and @TwitterMoments, where we will continue to share updates and information on #Inauguration2021.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nelections\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

We will continue to remove demonstrably false or potentially misleading content that has the highest risk of causing harm. However, we are providing additional details about our framework for evaluating a potentially misleading claim, including when we would or would not require Tweets to include an explicit call to action (e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009ceveryone should stop wearing masks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d) in order to take action.\nWhen evaluating whether or not to remove the most harmful misinformation on our platform, we consider three criteria:\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is the content advancing a claim of fact regarding COVID-19?\nFor a Tweet to qualify as a misleading claim, it must be an assertion of fact (not an opinion), expressed definitively, and intended to influence others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavior. Some examples include information about:\nthe origin, nature, and characteristics of the virus;\npreventative measures, treatments/cures, and other precautions;\nthe prevalence of viral spread, or the current state of the crisis;\nofficial health advisories, restrictions, regulations, and public-service announcements;\nhow vulnerable communities are affected by/responding to the pandemic.\n2. Is the claim demonstrably false or misleading?\u00c2\u00a0 \nUnder this policy, we consider claims to be false or misleading if (1) they have been confirmed to be false by subject-matter experts, such as public health authorities; or (2) they include information which is shared in a way that could confuse or deceive people. Some of the factors we consider include:\nWhether the content of the Tweet, including media, has been significantly altered, manipulated, doctored, or fabricated;\nWhether claims are presented improperly or out of context;\nWhether claims shared in a Tweet are widely accepted by experts to be inaccurate or false.\n3. Would belief in this information, as presented, lead to harm?\nWe will not be able to take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. Our focus in the COVID-19 policy is narrowed to address those claims that could adversely impact an individual, group, or community. We are most concerned with misleading information that:\nMay increase the likelihood of exposure to the virus;\nMay have adverse effects on the public health system\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity to cope with the crisis;\nCould lead to discrimination and avoidance of communities and/or places of business based on their perceived affiliation with protected groups.\nCOVID-19 related content that meet all three of the criteria defined above\u00e2\u0080\u0094i.e. that are claims of fact, demonstrably false or misleading, and likely to cause harm\u00e2\u0080\u0094may not be shared on Twitter and are subject to removal. Accounts that break this rule repeatedly may be permanently suspended. Further details about some of the most common types of misleading claims which we will remove under this policy are provided below.\nWe may label or place a warning on tweets to provide additional context in situations where the risks of harm associated with a Tweet are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled. This will make it easier to find facts and make informed decisions about what people see on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0In line with our existing enforcement approach, Tweets that are labeled under this expanded guidance will have reduced visibility across the service. Reducing the visibility of Tweets means that we will not amplify the Tweets on a number of surfaces across Twitter. However, anyone following the account will still be able to see the Tweet and Retweet.\nThe world has changed since this pandemic was first declared and public health experts, medical professionals, scientists and researchers now know more about how we can best stay safe and healthy. As the situation evolves and as global health advisories shift to cope with the pandemic, we are committed to ensuring our rules and enforcement actions reflect that evolution.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMay 11, 2020\u00c2\u00a0\nUpdating our approach to misleading information\u00c2\u00a0\nIn serving the public conversation, our goal is to make it easy to find credible information on Twitter and to limit the spread of potentially harmful and misleading content. Starting today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing new labels and warning messages that will provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19.

Examples include, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for two months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 run to the grocery store ASAP and buy everything\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009c5G causes coronavirus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 go destroy the cell towers in your neighborhood!\".\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nApril 2, 2020\nOur ads policy for COVID-19\nIn response to the shifting advertising landscape, and in order to support helpful causes during this time, we're now allowing managed clients and partners to advertise content containing implicit or explicit reference to COVID-19 in the following use cases, with restrictions:\nAdjustments to business practices and/or models in response to COVID-19\nSupport for customers and employees related to COVID-19\nThe following restrictions apply to these use cases:\nDistasteful references to COVID-19 (or variations) are prohibited\nContent may not be sensational or likely to incite panic\nPrices of products related to COVID-19 may not be inflated\nThe promotion of certain products related to COVID-19 may be prohibited. We currently prohibit the advertising of medical facemasks and alcohol hand sanitizers. Please note that other products may be added to this list and enforcement can be retroactive.\nThe mention of vaccines, treatments and test kits is permitted, only in the form of information, from news publishers which have been exempted under the Political Ads Content policy.\nRead more about the policy.

Rather than reports, we are enforcing this in close coordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult with information from those sources when reviewing content.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to prioritize removing content when it has a clear call to action that could directly pose a risk to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health or well-being, but we want to make it clear that we will not be able to take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. This is not meant to limit good faith discussion or expressing hope about ongoing studies related to potential medical interventions that show promise.\nSince introducing these policies on March 18, we have removed more than 1,100 Tweets containing misleading and potentially harmful content from Twitter. Additionally, our automated systems have challenged more than 1.5 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors. We will continue to use both technology and our teams to help us identify and stop spammy behavior and accounts.\nWe may also apply the public interest notice in cases where world leaders violate the COVID-19 guidelines.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAutomated technology and what to expect if you file a report\nHow are we using automated technology during this time?\nTo help us review reports more efficiently by surfacing content that's most likely to cause harm and should be reviewed first.\nTo help us proactively identify rule-breaking content before it's reported. Our systems learn from past decisions by our review teams, so over time, the technology is able to help us rank content or challenge accounts automatically.\nFor content that requires additional context, such as misleading information around COVID-19, our teams will continue to review those reports manually.\nWhat you can expect if you file a report during this time:\nIf you've reported an account or Tweet to us, it will take longer than normal for us to get back to you. We appreciate your patience as we continue to make adjustments.\nBecause these automated systems don't have all of the context and insight our team has, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make mistakes. If you think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a mistake, you can let us know and appeal here.\nWe appreciate your patience as we work to keep our teams safe, while also making sure we're protecting everyone on Twitter. You can always continue to use hide replies, mute, block, reply filters, and the other tools we offer you to control conversations on the service.\nRead the original post.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 27, 2020  An update on our content moderation work\nWe have broadened our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Rather than reports, we are enforcing this in close coordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult with information from those sources when reviewing content.\nUnder this guidance, we will require people to remove Tweets that include:\nStatements which are intended to influence others to violate recommended COVID-19 related guidance from global or local health authorities to decrease someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likelihood of exposure to COVID-19, such as: \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial distancing is not effective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s summertime, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need a mask anymore, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wear your mask!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNote: We will not require the removal of Tweets that include information about or encouragement to participate in demonstrations or protests.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nMisleading claims that unharmful but ineffective methods are cures or absolute treatments for COVID-19, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCoronavirus is vulnerable to UV radiation - walking outside in bright sunlight will prevent COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDescription of harmful treatments or preventative measures which are known to be ineffective or are being shared out of context to mislead people, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrinking bleach and ingesting colloidal silver will cure COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDenial of established scientific facts about transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance from global and local health authorities, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID-19 does not infect children because we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen any cases of children being sick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFalse or misleading information that would allow the reader to diagnose themselves as either having or not having COVID-19, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have coronavirus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nUnverified claims that have the potential to incite people to action, could lead to the destruction or damage of critical infrastructure, or could lead to widespread panic/social unrest may be considered a violation of our policies.

We want to be clear: while we work to ensure our systems are consistent, they can sometimes lack the context that our teams bring, and this may result in us making mistakes. As a result, we will not permanently suspend any accounts based solely on our automated enforcement systems. Instead, we will continue to look for opportunities to build in human review checks where they will be most impactful.

We have been consistently monitoring the conversation on the service to make sure keywords \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including common misspellings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also generate the search prompt.\nIn each country where we have launched the initiative, we have partnered with the national public health agency or the World Health Organization (@WHO) directly. The proactive search prompt is in place with official local partnerships in more than 70 countries around the world.\nThey include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Yemen.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n#AdsForGood support and additional protections\nBased on our Inappropriate Content Policy, we will halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the COVID-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads. Government entities that want to disseminate public health information will be permitted to promote ads on COVID-19. In the case of COVID-19, we have put additional safeguards into place in order to facilitate the sharing of trusted public health information and to reduce potential harm to users. We are currently prohibiting the promotion of all medical masks and alcohol hand sanitizers due to strong correlation to COVID-19 and instances of inflated prices globally.\nIn addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committing Ads for Good credits to nonprofit organizations to ensure they can build campaigns to fact-check and get reputable health information to the widest possible audiences. For example, as part of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN/@factchecknet), we have supported the Spanish organization @maldita_es and @malditobulo, which focuses on mitigating the impact of disinformation on public discourse through fact-checking and data journalism techniques. In Asia, we have partnered with the Taiwan Fact Checking Center (@taiwantfc), which has been using Twitter to connect with IFCN fact checkers around the world via #CoronavirusFacts. They are working in real time to find credible information and debunk rumors in Chinese.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFurthering our partnerships\nOur Global Public Policy team has open lines of communication with relevant multinational stakeholders, including the World Health Organization, numerous global government and public health organizations, and officials around the world, to ensure they can troubleshoot account issues, get their experts verified, and seek strategic counsel as they use the power of Twitter to mitigate harm.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also in close contact with our industry peers and will attend all relevant cross-functional meetings. As a uniquely open service, our data is being used in research every day and our researchers hub is publicly available. We welcome applications for the use of Twitter data to support research on COVID-19. We will also explore further #DataForGood partnerships to assess how our data products can enhance academic and NGO understanding of public health emergencies now and into the future.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nDonation matching\nWe've set up a dedicated internal COVID-19 campaign page through our employee donation matching program to support humanitarian response and relief efforts around the world. Any Twitter employee can donate to relevant nonprofit organizations, and Twitter will match donations up to $2,000 per employee.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat can you do?\nLooking for advice on how best to use Twitter in a time like this? Follow @WHO and your local health ministry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seek out the authoritative health information and ignore the noise. See something suspicious or abusive, report it to us immediately. Most importantly, think before you Tweet. Through Twitter Moments, we have curated longer-form content that helps tell the full story of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening around COVID-19 globally. For educators and parents, consult our media literacy guide, which was built in partnership with @UNESCO, here.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re absolutely committed to playing our part and will continue to provide substantive updates as this situation evolves.

This is a unique dataset that covers many tens of millions of Tweets daily and offers insight into the evolving global public conversation surrounding an unprecedented crisis. Making this access available for free is one of the most unique and valuable things Twitter can do as the world comes together to protect our communities and seek answers to pressing challenges.\u00c2\u00a0 \nYou can read more about this endpoint and the application process on our developer blog.\nBack to top\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n5. Ensuring site reliability\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 27, 2020 \nHow we're keeping the service running and the Tweets flowing\nKeeping the service running and the Tweets flowing is one of our top priorities in these difficult times. Our work has never been more critical and our service has never been in higher demand. In the past few weeks, we have seen more and more people turn to Twitter to participate in the public conversation and follow what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in real time.\nThe global conversation about COVID-19 and ongoing product improvements are driving up total monetizable DAU (mDAU), with quarter-to-date average total mDAU reaching approximately 164 million, up 23% from 134 million in Q1 2019 and up 8% from 152 million in Q4 2019.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen a 45% increase in our curated events page usage and a 30% increase in Direct Message (DM) usage since March 6.\nWhile many of our teams are transitioning to working from home, some of our infrastructure teams have physical responsibilities that are critical to keeping our data centers, and Twitter, up and running. These teams are operating under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cessential services\u00e2\u0080\u009d provisions dedicated in City, County, and State orders to ensure business continuity. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the Tweets flowing without their daily dedication and hard work.\nThe combination of the new work environment and the increased load on our platform has placed unique stresses on our operations, requiring our engineering teams to work more closely together than ever to respond to new demands, and to plan for the future. From our IT, Network, and Product Engineering teams to our Infrastructure and Data Center teams, we have collectively mobilized to ensure we are able to stay safe and productive under the stress of the new levels of traffic we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on our service.\nThe effects of COVID-19 on Twitter have already surpassed any event we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that as the pandemic continues, we will see additional stress on our service. Beyond Twitter, COVID-19 has also had a far-sweeping impact on our supply chain partners. Whereas normally we'd have months of lead time to add hardware capacity for expected growth, in this case, manufacturing delays in China have compromised the supply chain, resulting in delays in deliveries to our data centers. Our Data Center, SiteOps, Supply Chain, Hardware Engineering, and Mission Critical teams continue to manage the physical infrastructure that underlies the service \u00e2\u0080\u0094 expertly innovating to unlock additional capacity in existing supply.\nOur teams are actively addressing areas where we need to add capacity to critical services, looking at how we can optimize existing technology to perform better, and planning for how we might adjust to the way people are using Twitter during this time.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical for Twitter to stay up and running through this global crisis. Our teams are focused, and as we make changes to our systems to meet these new demands, we will communicate openly. We will share what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned, and if we see incidents, what we will do to recover as quickly as possible.

Keeping our employees and partners safe\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMay 12, 2020 \n#LoveWhereverYouWork\nTwitter was one of the first companies to go to a work from home model in the face of COVID-19, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anticipate being one of the first to return to offices.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to return.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about the next few months:\nOpening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith very few exceptions, offices won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open before September. When we do decide to open offices, it also won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere will also be no business travel before September, with very few exceptions, and no in-person company events for the rest of 2020. We will assess 2021 events later this year.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of the early action we took to protect the health of our employees and our communities. That will remain our top priority as we work through the unknowns of the coming months.\n#LoveWhereverYouWork\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 11, 2020 \nMandatory work from home and supporting our employees\nOur top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic. To continue this push, we are moving beyond our earlier guidance of \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrongly encouraging work from home\u00e2\u0080\u009d provided on March 2 and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home.\nWe understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times. And we will continue to do all that we can to support our Tweeps, including:\nPaying our contractors, vendors and hourly workers\nFor contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their responsibilities from home, Twitter will continue to pay their labor costs to cover standard working hours while Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work-from-home guidance and/or travel restrictions related to their assigned office are in effect.\nAdditional resources to support parents\nAs part of our ongoing global benefits support, Twitter is stepping in to ease additional expenses parents may be experiencing when their normal daycare closes due to COVID-19 by providing reimbursement for the additional daycare expenses incurred.\nHelping Tweeps set up their at-home offices\nAll employees, including hourly workers, will receive reimbursement toward their home office set up expenses, and we are working with our vendors to ensure our contractors' work-from-home needs are met as well. We listened to employee feedback and expanded our policy to include home office equipment, such as desks, desk chairs, and ergonomic chair cushions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also allowing Tweeps to expense online fees while working from home.\n#FlockTalk\nLast year, we introduced #FlockTalk, a program activated when Tweeps want to come together during difficult times to share what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders. News around COVID-19 is impacting people in a number of different ways \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from schools and offices being closed, to serious health concerns, to racism toward communities, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all dealing with a lot. The Twitter Inclusion & Diversity team (@TwitterTogether), in partnership with @TwitterAsians, will host a virtual #FlockTalk that acknowledges there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a direct correlation between conversations between us, the health of our workplace, and the health of our service.\nResource guides to make the work-from-home transition easier\nWorking from home can be a challenging transition, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided a variety of resource guides to help our employees continue to get the job done. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listing them here as well because at times like this, sharing insights and learning is so important. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all in this together and we want to help others outside of Twitter make their transitions to working outside of their offices easier.\nWorking-from-home best practices: We have shared the factors to consider to make sure Tweeps are ready to be productive and healthy. Some factors include workspace, communication, self-care, and logging hours. Overall, working from home doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change your day-to-day work, it just means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be doing it from a different environment.\nManaging a distributed team: Being a people manager means providing a consistent and positive employee experience for everyone on your team, regardless of location. This manager resource guide highlights the three key pillars of management: strategy, growth and care. So what changes when your team is fully distributed? The good news \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not much! These pillars still apply whether you manage a distributed or co-located team.\nVirtual interview guide: All interviews at Twitter will be done via video conferencing. A completely virtual interview has its benefits. It is ideal for introducing candidates to remote work cultures, and it is a great opportunity for candidates who will work remotely to get a sense for the experience of interacting with other team members remotely. While this virtual interview guide is not a holistic interview guide, it instead focuses on the aspects of interviewing candidates remotely that differ from interviewing candidates in-person.\nWe have also shared guides for working across time zones, using collaboration tools to stay connected, and ergonomic tips for working from home and on-the-go.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue sharing information as we navigate these changes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in dedication to keeping our Tweeps and everyone around us healthy. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all in this together!\nRead the original post.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 2, 2020 Encouraging employees to work from home\nIn addition to the travel, event, and visitor restrictions that we previously shared, today we provided additional guidance as we look to protect the health and safety of our workforce. Beginning today, we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able. Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 for us \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the world around us. We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation. We recognize that working from home is not ideal for some job functions. For those employees who prefer or need to come into the offices, they will remain open for business. Our Real Estate & Workplace team is increasing deep-cleaning and sanitizing in all spaces, as well as more visual reminders for personal hygiene best practices and prepackaged, precomposed, and preplated food options.\nWorking from home will be mandatory for employees based in our Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea offices due in part to government restrictions. Our criteria will evolve over time as we get more information, and we will communicate to affected Tweeps as appropriate.\nWhile this is a big change for us, we have already been moving toward a more distributed workforce that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly remote. We're a global service and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to enabling anyone, anywhere, to work at Twitter.\nRead the original post.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 1, 2020 Suspending noncritical business travel and events\nWe recently shared information about the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to surface the right information to promote constructive engagement and to highlight credible information around the spread of #coronavirus COVID-19. We will continue to update the public on these efforts this week.\nWe also have the responsibility of ensuring that the health and safety of our employees and partners is not compromised. We have continued to monitor the situation closely and are adjusting our internal policies to respond to this rapidly evolving situation. On February 29, we informed our people and started notifying partners that we are suspending all noncritical business travel and events.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis policy is effective immediately and will continue until the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control deem it appropriate to step back from pandemic precautionary measures or when a vaccine becomes available.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur goal is to reduce the risk that anyone at Twitter might contract or inadvertently spread the virus. It is important that we take these proactive steps to protect ourselves and others and minimize the spread of COVID-19.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere are enormous transnational efforts underway to tackle this virus. As a global company with a global workforce, we want to do what we can to help the success of these multistakeholder containment efforts. Temporarily suspending travel is an immediate and important step.\nWe want to thank our people, partners, and customers for their patience and understanding.\nRead the original post.\nBack to top\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n7.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be transparent about all of this work as the US Presidential Inauguration on January 20, 2021, approaches.\nUpdated our coordinated harmful activity policy\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm. Given the violent events in Washington, DC, and increased risk of harm, we began permanently suspending thousands of accounts that were primarily dedicated to sharing QAnon content on Friday afternoon.\nMany of the individuals impacted by this updated enforcement action held multiple accounts, driving up the total number of accounts impacted. Since Friday, more than 70,000 accounts have been suspended as a result of our efforts, with many instances of a single individual operating numerous accounts. These accounts were engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur updated enforcement on QAnon content on Twitter, along with routine spam challenges, has resulted in changes in follower count for some people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter accounts. In some cases, these actions may have resulted in follower count changes in the thousands.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs stipulated in this policy that we announced ahead of the 2020 US election, accounts that have Tweeted or Retweeted associated content will continue to be subject to limited visibility across search, replies, and on timelines and are prohibited from being recommended to others by Twitter. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that these types of accounts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that are not predominantly engaged in sharing this material \u00e2\u0080\u0094 can see different perspectives in the open public conversation that Twitter uniquely provides.\nOur teams are discussing ways we can empower research into QAnon and coordinated harmful activity on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nEscalated enforcement measures for our Civic Integrity Policy\nDuring the past several weeks, misleading and false information surrounding the 2020 US presidential election has been the basis for incitement to violence around the country. We took action on these claims in line with our Civic Integrity Policy.\nNow that the results of the election have been officially certified by Congress, we updated our Civic Integrity policy on Friday to aggressively increase our enforcement action on these claims. The updated policy provides details about how we enforce against violations of this policy, including repeated sharing of Tweets that receive warning labels. Ultimately, repeated violations of this policy can result in permanent suspension.\nDeployed tech to surface potentially harmful Tweets for urgent human review\nOur teams are continuing to aggressively deploy technology to surface potentially harmful Tweets for human review in an effort to take action as quickly as possible on violative content. Using this combination of technology and human review helps our teams work at scale during this critical time. We continue to update these tools as terminology and behaviors evolve on Twitter.\nLimited engagement on labeled Tweets\nOn Tuesday, we limited engagement by no longer allowing any Tweets labeled for violations of our civic integrity policy to be replied to, Liked or Retweeted. People on Twitter are still able to Quote Tweet to share this content with additional context or their own perspective.\nBlocked violative keywords from Search and Trends\nWe want Trends to promote healthy conversations on Twitter. This means, at times, we may prevent certain content from trending. There are rules for Trends, and if we identify Trends that violate these rules, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take enforcement action.\nSince last week, we've prohibited certain terms from surfacing in Trends and Search based on the following Twitter Rules:\nCoordinated harmful activity\nCivic integrity\nHateful conduct\nGlorification of violence\nViolent threats\nSensitive media\u00c2\u00a0\nWe will also continue to prioritize reviewing and adding context to Trends. Our goal is to help people see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening while ensuring that potentially confusing trends are presented with context.\nFought spam and challenged potentially inauthentic accounts\nIt is against the Twitter Rules to engage in spamming behavior, including bulk, aggressive, or deceptive activity. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we routinely deploy anti-spam challenges to accounts to fight this behavior and protect the public conversation. During these challenges, account owners must verify their authenticity through a variety of measures, such as reCAPTCHA or providing a functional email address.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs always, while accounts are undergoing these challenges, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re temporarily removed from follower counts. This, along with our updated enforcement around coordinated harmful activity, means some people may notice drops or fluctuations in their follower count.\u00c2\u00a0\nAhead of the inauguration, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to monitor the situation, keep open lines of communication with law enforcement, and keep the public informed of additional enforcement actions.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

In line with this philosophy, in August we launched our new Twitter Transparency Center to make our data easier to understand and analyze for those who access our biannual Twitter Transparency Report.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur latest Twitter Transparency Report includes data from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2020.\u00c2\u00a0\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted business operations for all of us around the world. Given the changes in workflows, coupled with country specific COVID-19 restrictions, there was some significant and unpredictable disruption to our content moderation work and the way in which teams assess content and enforce our policies - a disruption that is reflected in some of the data presented today. We increased our use of machine learning and automation to take a wide range of actions on potentially abusive and misleading content, whilst continually focusing human review in areas where the likelihood of harm was the greatest.\nIn March, we launched a COVID-19 misleading information policy to further protect the health of the public conversation. During this reporting period, our teams took enforcement action against 4,658 accounts for violations of this policy. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve further invested in technology, our automated systems challenged 4.5 million accounts that were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur work on information operations\nTwitter discloses state-backed actors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 attempts to disrupt the conversation on the service. During this reporting period, we took action on more than 52,000 accounts that we reliably attributed to information operations originating within China, Russia, Turkey, Serbia, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Ghana and Nigeria as well as a KSA-affiliated actor.\u00c2\u00a0\nPlatform manipulation\nWe continued our zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to undermine the integrity of our service. During this latest reporting period, our teams saw a 54% increase in anti-spam challenges \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an increase that is due in part to the proactive measures we put in place to protect the conversation around COVID-19. We also saw a 16% increase in the number of spam reports, compared to the last reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nTerrorism & violent extremism\nThere was a 5% increase in the number of accounts removed for violations of our terrorism and violent extremism policies during this reporting period \u00e2\u0080\u0094 94% of those accounts were proactively identified. Our current methods of surfacing potentially violating content for human review include leveraging the shared industry hash database supported by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT).\nChild sexual exploitation\nWe do not tolerate child sexual exploitation (CSE) on Twitter. CSE material is removed from the service without further notice and reported to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). As we have expanded our teams and increased operational capacity in this area, we saw a 68% increase in our enforcement under our Child Sexual Exploitation Policy.\nCopyright and trademark\nUnder our Copyright Policy, we received 15% more Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notices affecting 87% more accounts during this reporting period. Under our Trademark Policy, our trademark notice compliance decreased by 30% during this time.\nTwitter Rules enforcement\nAbuse/harassment\nTargeted harassment of someone, or inciting other people to do so, is against the Twitter Rules. There was a 34% decrease in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our abuse policy.\nCivic integrity\nWe saw a steady increase in the number of accounts actioned under our Civic Integrity Policy, as elections happened around the world during this reporting period. There was a 37% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of this policy during this reporting period.\nHateful conduct\nOver the six month reporting period and amidst the COVID-19 disruptions to workflow, we saw a 35% decrease in the number of accounts actioned under our Hateful Conduct Policy. In March 2020, our Hateful Conduct Policy expanded to cover new facets of our dehumanization guidance, specifically prohibiting language that dehumanizes people on the basis of age, disability, and disease.\nPromoting suicide & self-harm\nWe do not permit people to promote, advocate, and persuade another individual to engage in self-harm or suicide. There was a 49% decrease in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our suicide or self-harm policy.\u00c2\u00a0\nPrivate information\nWe have clear rules around the sharing of private information on our service. During this reporting period, we continued to see an upward trend in our enforcement under this policy \u00e2\u0080\u0094 up by 68%. This increase was due to our proactive efforts in this area.\u00c2\u00a0\nNon-consensual nudity\nEnforcement numbers for non-consensual nudity (NCN) on the service experienced a 58% decrease. We'll continue working to improve processes and models to be as proactive as possible in maintaining a healthy environment for the people on Twitter.\nInformation requests (legal requests for account information):\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter received 12,657 legal requests for account information specifying 25,560 accounts during this period, from 68 different countries.\nRemoval requests (legal requests for content removal)*:\nTwitter received 42,220 legal demands to remove content specifying 85,375 accounts during this period, from 53 different countries.\u00c2\u00a0\n96% of the total global volume of requests originated from five countries: Japan, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and India.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese requests impacted approximately 13% fewer accounts compared to the previous reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe received 19% more reports based on local law(s) from trusted reporters and non-governmental organizations, impacting approximately 7% more accounts, compared to the previous reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\u00c2\u00a0\nAs noted throughout the report, the COVID-19 pandemic did significantly disrupt our content moderation work during this time - a disruption that is reflected in much of the data presented today. Our enforcement teams have adjusted their approach in the context of a pandemic and are continuing to increase their capacity to get back to the strong pre-COVID levels of enforcement that is expected.\nThere will always be more work to do in this space, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to provide biannual Twitter Transparency Reports that offer more clarity into our operations and work to protect the public conversation.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe also recognize the importance of measuring prevalence of certain content on Twitter, and we have begun a multi-year initiative to enable us to provide more consistent transparency on these issues. We look forward to sharing more details in due course.\u00c2\u00a0\nFollow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for updates on our policies and our work on transparency throughout the year.\u00c2\u00a0\n*Unless prohibited from doing so, we continue to publish these legal requests when we take action directly to the Lumen Database, a partnership with Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules entirely and cannot use Twitter to incite violence, among other things. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe below is a comprehensive analysis of our policy enforcement approach in this case.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOverview\nOn January 8, 2021, President Donald J. Trump Tweeted:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShortly thereafter, the President Tweeted:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDue to the ongoing tensions in the United States, and an uptick in the global conversation in regards to the people who violently stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, these two Tweets must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence, as well as in the context of the pattern of behavior from this account in recent weeks. After assessing the language in these Tweets against our Glorification of Violence policy, we have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service.\nAssessment\nWe\u00c2\u00a0assessed the two Tweets referenced above under our Glorification of Violence policy, which aims to prevent the glorification of violence that could inspire others to replicate violent acts and determined that they were highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\nThis determination is based on a number of factors, including:\nPresident Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an \u00e2\u0080\u009corderly transition\u00e2\u0080\u009d on January 20th.\nThe second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a \u00e2\u0080\u009csafe\u00e2\u0080\u009d target, as he will not be attending.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe use of the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerican Patriots\u00e2\u0080\u009d to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.\nThe mention of his supporters having a \u00e2\u0080\u009cGIANT VOICE long into the future\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an \u00e2\u0080\u009corderly transition\u00e2\u0080\u009d and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.\u00c2\u00a0\nPlans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs such, our determination is that the two Tweets above are likely to inspire others to replicate the violent acts that took place on January 6, 2021, and that there are multiple indicators that they are being received and understood as encouragement to do so.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

This new policy will lay the foundation for future improvements by defining what verification means, who is eligible for verification and why some accounts might lose verification to ensure the program is more equitable.\nPublic feedback has become a critical part of our policy development process by making sure our policies reflect the global nature of our service and the people who use it. In the two weeks during our public feedback period, we received more than 22,000 survey responses and learned so much about how we can improve our policy. Thank you for all you shared!\u00c2\u00a0\nHow your feedback shaped our policy\nHere are some of the areas we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve updated in our new verification policy based on your feedback: \nWe heard feedback that some of the criteria for a profile to be considered \u00e2\u0080\u009ccomplete\u00e2\u0080\u009d feels too restrictive, so we updated our definition to no longer require a profile bio or header image.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe updated our references to Wikipedia to better align with the encyclopedias' published standards for notability and article quality.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve clarified the titles of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNews\u00e2\u0080\u009d category to include \u00e2\u0080\u009cNews and Journalists\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSports\u00e2\u0080\u009d category to include \u00e2\u0080\u009cSports and esports'' to be more inclusive. We also added a reference in our \u00e2\u0080\u009cEntertainment\u00e2\u0080\u009d category to more clearly include digital content creators.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe heard feedback that measuring the minimum follower count requirement on a per-country basis wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always the right approach, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve updated this to be on a per-region basis to make our follower count requirements less susceptible to spam and more equitable across geographies.\nMany of you suggested we add categories for verification including academics, scientists and religious leaders, and we plan to explore adding dedicated categories for these to the policy some time next year. Until then, any of these individuals may qualify under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cActivists, organizers, and other influential individuals\u00e2\u0080\u009d category. For example, since March 2020, we have been working with global public health authorities to identify experts Tweeting about COVID-19 and have already verified hundreds of accounts as a part of this collaboration. These verifications will not be impacted by the new policy given the ongoing commitment to elevating credible information as it relates to the current public health crisis.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou can read our new verification policy here, or you can tap on the blue verified badge in-app or on the web to learn more.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin enforcing this policy on January 22, 2021*, which is also when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin automatically removing the verified badge from inactive and incomplete accounts. Our new policy defines a complete account as one that has all of the following:\u00c2\u00a0\neither a verified email address or phone number\na profile image\na display name\nIf your account is at risk of losing its verified badge, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll receive an automated email and an in-app notification informing you of what changes need to be made to avoid automatic removal of your blue verified badge. As long as you make those changes before January 22, 2021, your account will not lose its badge. We are not planning to automatically remove the verified badge from inactive accounts of people who are no longer living, and are working on building a way to memorialize these accounts in 2021. \nUnder our policy, we may also remove verification from accounts that are found to be in severe or repeated violation of the Twitter Rules. We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification. As always, everyone on Twitter is subject to the Twitter Rules, and you can read more about our range of enforcement actions here.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow to apply for verification in 2021\nWe are excited to relaunch public applications for verification in 2021 through a new, self-serve application process that will be available on the Account Settings page on the web and in-app. The process will include asking applicants to select a category for their verified status and confirming their identity via links and other supporting materials.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe plan to use both automated and human review processes to ensure that we are reviewing applications thoughtfully and in a timely manner. We also plan to give people the option to share demographic information after completing the new verification application so that we can better measure and improve the equity of our verification process. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share more details about the application process soon.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nVerification is just one part of our work to help people understand who they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interacting with on Twitter. We know that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not always easy to evaluate the authenticity of accounts on the internet, and that understanding who you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interacting with is core to the public conversation.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhen it comes to helping people trust who they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interacting with on Twitter, bios, Tweet content, mutual follows and profile information provide helpful context. This is why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started rolling out profile labels for political candidates, government accounts, and state-affiliated media. In addition to the changes we're making as we re-introduce verification, we're also working on new ways to designate different account types, starting with:\nAutomated Accounts: Accounts that post to Twitter automatically, also called bots, can bring a lot of value to the service when they share things like\u00c2\u00a0earthquake reports\u00c2\u00a0or\u00c2\u00a0self care reminders. But it can be confusing to people if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not clear that these accounts are automated. In 2021, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning to build a new account type to distinguish automated accounts from human-run accounts to make it easier for people to know what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bot and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not.\nMemorial Accounts: We know how important it is to preserve a Twitter account in memory of someone who has passed and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about building Memorial Accounts\u00c2\u00a0before. In 2021, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning to build a new account type specifically designed for memorialized accounts. This will also come with an updated policy for memorialization and a new application flow to request the memorialization of an account.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur work here is far from finished, but we want to give you a look ahead at what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing in this space so you can understand our approach. We are excited to relaunch verification and start rolling out these new account types, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share more soon.

We are excited to make this announcement, knowing that there has never been a third-party brand safety solution built to measure for adjacency to brand unsafe content in an environment like Twitter, which is both real-time and dynamic.\u00c2\u00a0We look forward to partnering with both DV and IAS to create custom solutions for our unique platform and we intend to start testing solutions in early 2021.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMeasuring brand safety and suitability across in-feed environments is critically important for brands. DV is ready to tackle this challenge by leveraging our technology and expertise to evaluate the context of real-time, user-generated content. We are pleased to partner with Twitter to ensure a brand safe and suitable advertising environment on their platform.\nMark Zagorski\nCEO at DoubleVerify\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@markzags\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nIAS is excited to partner with Twitter to pioneer in-feed brand safety and suitability solutions that will help advertisers navigate this dynamic social environment. Measurement is more critical than ever as marketers seek even greater transparency for their social media spend, and together with Twitter we can offer advertisers the trusted solutions they need.\nLisa Utzschneider\nCEO at Integral Ad Science\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@Lisa_Utz\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nOur commitment to MRC accreditation.\u00c2\u00a0\nLast week, we also shared our commitment to undergo the accreditation process across all four of the Media Ratings Council\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offered Accreditation Services: Viewability, Sophisticated Invalid Traffic Filtration, Audience Measurement, and Brand Safety. We will be prioritizing the Brand Safety audit first, and have already started the proposal process for this accreditation.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe believe that all four accreditations are critical in demonstrating our enduring commitment to transparency and are pleased to be in a position to expand on and sustain this collaborative process. We look forward to working with the MRC and further aligning on scope, sequencing, and timing.\nContinued partnership with industry leaders.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter is an active and founding member of the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM). In conjunction with our ongoing efforts to better align our brand safety solutions with GARM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s principles, we support\u00c2\u00a0DV and IAS in their efforts to adapt their current categorization frameworks to better map to the harmful monetized content categories identified by the GARM, the 4A\u00e2\u0080\u0099s APB, and the ANA. We will continue to partner with industry leaders to define and refine the work that is needed to keep platforms safe for advertisers.\u00c2\u00a0\nUnlocking research to learn more.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personalized feed-based environment makes content adjacency inherently unique when considering brand safety questions. It is critical to understand where associations occur, where they don't, and how those associations affect brands as we continue to invest in this area. Early research done by Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data science teams indicates that on our platform, adjacency between ads and divisive content has not yet been found to affect brand favorability. Currently, we are working on additional research to gain more knowledge and insight around the impact of adjacency on Twitter ads. We look forward to incorporating these findings into our ongoing work with DV and IAS and using it to inform how we build and iterate on our advertising products.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Source: Twitter Brand Surveys last exposure respondent level data from April - July 2020, Studies n = 82, Observations n = 150,434,  US\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nMarching towards 2021.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are excited to build on the existing momentum with our brand safety partners and to develop innovative solutions for our customers that help push our industry forward.

For the purposes of this study, we used a broad definition of divisive content, inclusive of 11 content categories including Politics, Social Movements, Ongoing News and Protests. For the purposes of this study, adjacency was defined broadly as any of the two Tweets above and the two Tweets below each of the Promoted Tweets and we analyzed results based on content both 1 and 2 spots away from ads. Analysis was performed both in aggregate and specific to each of the 11 categories of divisive content to determine if adjacency to certain types of divisiveness alter people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion of adjacent brands. Results showed no evidence of any effect on brand favorability when ads were adjacent to any of the studied categories of divisive content, regardless of the distance of the adjacency.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nads\nbrands\nhealth\npartnerships\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nFleets: a new way to join the conversation\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 November 2020\n          \nTransparency around image cropping and changes to come \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 1 October 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          "}

At Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of how we have continuously pivoted, first to protect and support employees during a global pandemic, and next by doubling down on our commitment to understanding and combating systemic racism and anti-Blackness in the United States and around the world.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBut it would be a disservice to all of the hard work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occurred across our business to solely focus on the curveballs the year has thrown us. At the beginning of the year we unveiled a bold new vision for 2025 and our initial plan for the hard work required to drive progress across the company. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud to say that despite the unpredictable nature of 2020, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve still made meaningful progress against these goals, and I want to tell you about it.\nFirst, a quick refresher on the vision we set forth early this year: by 2025, at least half of our global workforce will be women, and at least a quarter of our US workforce will be underrepresented minorities. Check out our Q4 diversity numbers to see the steady progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in 2020.\nAlong with that bold vision, as a company we doubled down on deeper commitments across leadership, transparency, and accountability \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all to drive progress along our journey to be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most diverse and inclusive tech company.\u00c2\u00a0 Here are a few highlights from our work across the company:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAccountability\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAccountability starts at the top. So in addition to the company-wide goals set for workforce representation, we worked with our executive team to clearly define their proportional share of responsibility for driving progress, taking into account the size of the businesses they lead, their open headcount, projected pace of hiring, and average attrition rates.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn order for our approach to work, every employee at Twitter needs to be aligned on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to achieve \u00e2\u0080\u0094 not just the executive team. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why in 2019 we created an internal diversity dashboard so any Tweep can track in real time how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing against our workforce representation goals by gender (global) and race/ethnicity (US), with filters for leadership and technical/nontechnical roles \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and hold us accountable.\nWe recently launched version 3.0 of our diversity dashboard which dramatically expands transparency across these metrics, providing visibility across the board to give Tweeps the opportunity to critically examine how their team is doing and be part of the solution. In version 3.0, the only instances where we restrict visibility on the diversity dashboard is when the size of the team is too small to maintain the privacy of our Tweeps.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Note: For illustration purposes only\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nResponsibility for I&D progress belongs to all of us. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the new dashboard also includes an action roadmap that outlines five simple steps every Tweep can take to drive progress in their part of the business.\nRemind their teams about voluntary Self ID in Workday. By choosing to participate, each Tweep can help ensure the numbers above reflect the true makeup of their team.\nJoin a Global Business Resource Group (BRG) and participate as a team in BRG events. BRGs are Tweep-led, and advocate for underrepresented communities while fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace.\nCheck to ensure everyone on their team has completed our I&D trainings: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy Conversations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWords Matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAllyship 101.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDevelop an action plan to improve their team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inclusion Scores on the next employee engagement. \nSchedule an hour for their team to watch a #TwitterTogetherTalk (e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow to be an Anti-Racist\u00e2\u0080\u009d or Criminal Justice Reform) and host a debrief using our discussion guides.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTransparency\nWe also spent 2020 exploring ways to build on our industry-leading transparency on workforce representation to include impact or outcome-based metrics. One of the things we are looking at is representation in leadership roles and pay equity. Our first step in this new area examines differences by gender, which we will share in our annual report early next year. Work is also underway to increase pay transparency and starting in 2021, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share with Tweeps the pay bands for their individual position.\u00c2\u00a0\nAnother important body of work this year was around promotions. Like most companies, we often get questions from Tweeps who want to better understand how promo decisions are made. So in addition to sharing with Tweeps the results of a review of the audit of promo data that we conducted, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched a Consistency & Fairness Taskforce to review our promotions process across Twitter from end to end. This work will explore new measures to disrupt potential bias: a data-informed promotion readiness pipeline; increased transparency and consistency in the frequency, makeup and process of promotion committees; and increased communications and training about the process.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFinally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to have made even more strides this year in inclusive hiring (check out our\u00c2\u00a0career site\u00c2\u00a0for open roles!). Building on learnings from a pilot program in 2019, we have expanded our Diverse Slates Initiative (DSI) from Senior Director roles to all Manager and above roles across the company. Moving forward, for a hiring decision to be made on any open role, at least one woman (global) and one Black or Latinx candidate (US) must have been considered by the interview panel.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe expanded DSI is complemented by an Inclusive Hiring e-learning module centered on five principles we want every Tweep to understand and follow:\nAlways hire the most qualified candidate.\nStart with a candidate pool that reflects our communities.\nEnsure a fair and equitable hiring process.\nMap candidates to core competencies and our values \u00e2\u0080\u0094 hire for culture add not culture fit.\nLead with diversity and inclusion throughout the interview experience.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTaking stock of what actually went right in 2020 is quite the flex. But in retrospect, the strides we made across our inclusion and diversity efforts in leadership, transparency and accountability are significant. They represent the extraordinary efforts of Tweeps across every part of our business. Thanks to them, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to take bold steps.

Indeed, as concern grows in Europe regarding the impact of digital technology and repressive regimes around the world use draconian legal frameworks to stifle online freedoms, the norms that inform new EU legislation has never been more important.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Digital Services Act and the Democracy Action Plan will either renew the promise of the Open Internet or compound a problematic status quo \u00e2\u0080\u0093 by limiting our online environment to a few dominant gatekeepers, while failing to meaningfully address the challenges preventing the Internet from realising its potential.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re writing to you today as a group of companies to advocate for a regulatory conversation around illegal and harmful content that firmly roots Open Internet principles at the heart of the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digital future.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere are many other companies and organisations that share the views set out here \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we welcome their collaboration in the coming discussions.\nCONTENT AND SPEECH\nUnfortunately, the present conversation is too often framed through the prism of content removal alone, where success is judged solely in terms of ever-more content removal in ever-shorter periods of time. Without question, illegal content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including terrorist content and child sexual abuse material \u00e2\u0080\u0093 must be removed expeditiously. Indeed, many creative self-regulatory initiatives proposed by the European Commission have demonstrated the effectiveness of an EU-wide approach.\u00c2\u00a0\nYet by limiting policy options to a solely stay up-come down binary, we forgo promising alternatives that could better address the spread and impact of problematic content while safeguarding rights and the potential for smaller companies to compete. Indeed, removing content cannot be the sole paradigm of Internet policy, particularly when concerned with the phenomenon of \u00e2\u0080\u0098legal-but-harmful\u00e2\u0080\u0099 content. Such an approach would benefit only the very largest companies in our industry.\nWe therefore encourage a content moderation discussion that emphasises the difference between illegal and harmful content and highlights the potential of interventions that address how content is surfaced and discovered. Included in this is how consumers are offered real choice in the curation of their online environment.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe believe that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both more sustainable and more holistically effective to focus on limiting the number of people who encounter harmful content. This can be achieved by placing a technological emphasis on visibility over prevalence, supporting measures towards algorithmic transparency and control, setting limits to the discoverability of harmful content, further exploring community moderation, and providing meaningful user choice. The tactics will vary from service to service but the underlying approach will be familiar.\u00c2\u00a0\nBy focusing on these kinds of metrics and developing corresponding transparency standards, EU policy interventions can better tackle the harms associated with problematic content online, while mitigating the negative impact on freedom of expression that blunt content removal obligations entail.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe further support a harmonised notice-and-action mechanism for illegal content as proposed by the D9+ group, which would clarify obligations and provide legal certainty in situations where content removal is the most appropriate solution, without overburdening SMEs or limiting users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights to redress. Notice-and-action mechanisms should also include measures proportionate to the nature and impact of the illegal content in question.\u00c2\u00a0\nREGULATION FOR A NEW GENERATION\nIn the digital world, content policy can influence the shape of markets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne-size-fits-all\u00e2\u0080\u009d approaches that fail to consider the vast array of differentiated services that make up our online environment risk having a disproportionate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and potentially crippling \u00e2\u0080\u0093 impact on smaller players, thereby inadvertently helping to entrench large companies that have greater compliance resources.\u00c2\u00a0\nTherefore, as regulatory mechanisms are considered, we recommend a tech-neutral and human rights-based approach to ensure legislation transcends individual companies and technological cycles. Interventions like the recent EU Copyright directive remind us that there are major drawbacks in prescribing generalised compliance solutions. These solutions have a regressive impact on smaller players and perversely incentivise the deployment of flawed technology. Moreover, we simply cannot anticipate how burgeoning technology will shape the services and platforms we use today. Consequently, our rules must be sufficiently flexible to accommodate and allow for the harnessing of sectoral shifts, such as the rise of decentralised hosting of content and data.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis far-sighted approach can be ensured by developing regulatory proposals that optimise for effective collaboration and meaningful transparency between three core groups: companies, regulators and civil society. While companies must take primary responsibility for designing and operating their services with diligence and care, co-regulatory oversight grounded in regional and global norms can ensure these efforts are effective, durable, and protective of individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rights.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe believe these positions and principles offer a path to an online society that renews the original promise of the Internet while deftly meeting our shared challenges. We ask the Commission, Parliament, Member States, and all stakeholders to consider our collective views while developing these historic laws which will likely govern our online lives for a generation, while setting another groundbreaking precedent for the world to follow.\u00c2\u00a0 \nIn sum, we ask the EU to defend the Open Internet.\u00c2\u00a0\nSigned,\n@Policy, @Mozilla, @Automattic, @Vimeo\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npartnerships\npolicy\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

But 2020 is different. The world saw heartbreaking loss but also tremendous courage. How do we possibly recap a year like this? By turning our attention to how we all got through it together: the ways we kept ourselves entertained, the changes we made, and the messages of support that we shared with each other. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re over 2020, we get it; if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re curious to see how the world conversed, coped, and even celebrated this year, read on for a brief tour through the Tweets of 2020.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn the midst of everything that happened in the world this year, Twitter was the place where we came together to keep our sanity during quarantine, be forces of change, and yes, still jump in on the latest viral meme.\n#ThisHappened on Twitter:\u00c2\u00a0\nThe most Retweeted and top Liked Tweets of the year encapsulate the full spectrum of life in 2020: loss, contemplation, distraction, entertainment, and a dash of humor.

Not only was the hashtag (and other variations on it) Tweeted nearly 400 million times, but we also saw the ways in which it changed how we Tweeted about so many other topics. With much of the world staying home more - in fact, #StayHome was the 3rd biggest hashtag of the year - we saw a change in habits through Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nGlobally, there were the equivalent of more than 7,000 Tweets per minute about TV and movies this year (so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that the \u00f0\u009f\u009b\u008b emoji went up 40%).\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweets about cooking nearly tripled this year (but that banana bread craze surged for only about three months and is now closer to normal-times levels), and the trends in food-related emojis suggest that everyone developed a serious sweet tooth and all those video calls created an upswing in adult beverages.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEven though many sports went on pause and looked a bit different when they returned, there were still two billion Tweets about sports. No stadium? No problem. With no fans in seats and sports bars not an option, people turned to the sports community on Twitter to share their hot takes and feelings of excitement, disappointment and in some cases, \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b2 reactions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFollowing #COVID19, the second most-Tweeted hashtag of the year was #BlackLivesMatter. The world mobilized and amplified the need for equality and social justice following the death of George Floyd, who was the third most-Tweeted-about person globally.\u00c2\u00a0\nPeople continued to utilize Twitter to publicly advocate for political change and demand accountability from world leaders this year. Over 700 million Tweets were sent in 2020 about elections around the world and Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Narendra Modi and Kamala Harris were among the most Tweeted-about global figures.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCitizens and sports stars alike, from the UK to Colombia and India turned to Twitter to advocate for important causes:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis year also brought on a renewed sense of gratitude and support for our communities. Tweets expressing being grateful or thankful increased by 20% globally, with a particular recognition of doctors (+135%), teachers (+30%), and essential/frontline workers (that phrase was Tweeted more than 17 million times this year).\u00c2\u00a0\nFinally, here's a closer look at the most-Tweeted emojis on Twitter around the world this year:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo reflect on the year and join in on the conversation, check out #ThisHappened2020 as Twitter accounts around the world spotlight the top local Twitter moments from the year. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndata\ninsights\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nsociety & culture\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}
{"date": "Monday, 7 December 2020", "title": " The state of social intelligence: 2020 year in review", "topic": "Insights", "author": "Joe Rice", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/the-state-of-social-intelligence-2020-year-in-review", "post_text": "Insights\n The state of social intelligence: 2020 year in review\n            By\n            \n  \n  \nMonday, 7 December 2020\nLink copied successfully\nAlthough it seems like a lifetime, it was only a year ago that I published my\u00c2\u00a02019 social intelligence year in review. Back then, I observed that individuals and organizations were finally discovering the unique role that social data, in concert with other data sources, can play in helping to solve real business problems.\nWhile the uptake in digital data sources by\u00c2\u00a0 the research industry was well underway, little could I have imagined that a global pandemic would soon accelerate these dynamics, as almost overnight the world moved online. As one research agency friend put it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCovid-19 probably condensed three to four years of market research evolution into three or four months.\" And as brands have become accustomed to these new approaches to conducting research and gathering insight, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to imagine a rush back to the more traditional resource-heavy, set-piece approaches of the past.\nSo, as we exit this most unusual of years, what are the main trends driving the awareness and adoption of social intelligence today? In my conversations with social intelligence practitioners, four themes emerged that are changing market research more broadly, thus presenting an opportunity for social intelligence to shine.\u00c2\u00a0 \n1. Speed to insight\u00c2\u00a0 Clients are pushing to reduce the use of traditional, ad hoc market research projects in favour of quicker, more cost-effective approaches that provide real-time, behavioural insights. Speed to insight has always been a strength of social data. Not only does it give researchers instant access to millions of public consumer opinions on just about any topic imaginable, accessing that treasure trove of insight is a fraction of the cost of traditional research methods with similar sample sizes. Furthermore, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reusable, with multiple projects able to repurpose the same data sets in support of different research questions. If you are looking for speed and value for money, social delivers.\n2. Explosion of external data sources 20 years ago, if you wanted market share data, you had a very small group of providers to choose from. Today, you can get this data from dozens of sources. And as the importance and value of data have grown, many companies are now monetizing their own unique data sets. Everyone, it seems, is a data provider. The challenge now is in choosing the most relevant data set for the problem at hand or the question being asked. And far from being lost among these myriad data sources, social data is carving out an important place for itself, chiefly as a unique window into real observed human behaviours, with several advantages over traditional insight gathering techniques. \nFirst, its unprompted nature gets around one of the big challenges of research\u00e2\u0080\u0094the introduction of bias by the questions being asked. Secondly, social posts are sent in the moment, when the consumer is actually having the experience, therefore representing a much richer and authentic view of\u00c2\u00a0consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 true feelings\u00c2\u00a0on a topic, as opposed to asking them to recount that experience days or weeks later and out of the context in which they had it. This feature of social data should not be underestimated, for very little market research delivered today is conducted with that type of context in mind.\nAnd finally, social data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continuous nature allows you to move away from the one-and-done practice that has historically characterized market research projects and towards a longitudinal approach to data gathering. This allows you to see trends emerge over time. It also has the added advantage of allowing you to go back and analyze a topic retrospectively, uncovering views and attitudes preserved in time, forever.\n3. DIY meets data integration Historically, full-service research agencies provided both the data and the insights, but they are now increasingly seeing competition from their very own clients. The growth of DIY research platforms has allowed brands to insource market research capabilities such as survey creation and distribution. And brands have made data gathering and customer feedback collection an integral part of the user journey and experience, and therefore already know a lot about their customers. When combined, brands are better able to use their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 behavioural and transactional data to ask the right questions at the right times, thus providing even more relevant customer insight. \nTo date, social listening tools, a form of DIY research, have been the primary gateway for\u00c2\u00a0organizations to access social data. This is quickly changing as\u00c2\u00a0social data feeds are becoming\u00c2\u00a0increasingly embedded within a wide variety of solutions, ranging from Enterprise Feedback Management to digital data analytics. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this combination of social data with other data sets that is so promising and, with a little help from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), should provide unique new insights into how people think and behave.\n4. Truly game-changing innovation From the phone survey to the online survey and from social intelligence to artificial intelligence, new sources and techniques have emerged over the years that have improved the diversity and efficiency of data collection and analysis. They have also brought with them a host of new entrants into the industry, whether they be technology providers or tech-enabled specialist consultancies. The adoption of these type of digital analytics providers, for lack of a better term, has expanded the definition of the market research industry and doubled its size, now reckoned to be valued at $90 billion.1\nOne of the big underlying drivers behind this has been a slow but steady move away from question-based research methods and towards observational methodologies such as neuroscience, behavioural economics and data science. Dave Soderberg, Chief Data Officer at Black Swan Data, touched upon this revolution in his excellent blog post on the end of question-based market research. \nData Science in particular, aided by advances in different types of AI such as Natural Language Processing, has allowed us to understand and classify vast amounts of unstructured data (such as social) in a way that was unimaginable even a few years ago. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this continued innovation that will allow researchers and analysts the ability to finally leverage social data as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group. As Jeremy Hollow, Founder & MD of\u00c2\u00a0Listen + Learn Research\u00c2\u00a0succinctly put it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are we struggling to recruit people to talk about things they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already freely talking about on social?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n2021 and the slope of enlightenment After a year like 2020, it would be foolish to make any predictions about 2021 (as I attempted for 2020), other than to say that the importance and adoption of social intelligence within the insights world will only continue to grow. Even Gartner now thinks it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finally entering the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSlope of Enlightenment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It has certainly been a journey, with social intelligence reaching its formative, teenage years just as market research hits a midlife crisis and tries to redefine itself. So where do we go from here then? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m reminded of the Royal Society\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motto, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNullius in verba\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0- \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to start your move to social intelligence, get inspired at data.twitter.com.\n1 ESOMAR Global Market Research Study 2020\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n#sociallistening\n#socialmonitoring\n#TwitterData\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsocial listening\nsocial monitoring\nTwitter Data\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          \nWhy business IQ is not enough in the era of the relationship economy\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 14 February 2020\n          \nIs 2020 the year of prediction?\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 8 January 2020\n          "}

It pre-dates the Internet and modern communications technology of course, but has adapted and changed as online spaces have emerged to become contested territories of geo-political competition.\nIt would be naive to think that events and conversations in the future will not be targeted by bad actors - in addition to elections, conversations around Covid-19, climate action, identity and civil rights, to name a few, are all vulnerable to similar techniques. We have to respond. The first step towards doing so is by understanding the problem in detail \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a goal that Twitter and think tank Demos believe can best be advanced through transparency and open access to data.\u00c2\u00a0\nPlatforms like Twitter have taken a number of important steps to confront this problem, for example - having a dedicated site integrity team and continuous investment in technology to detect, understand and neutralize these campaigns as quickly and robustly as possible - but technology companies can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it alone. Academics, journalists and civil society groups must all be strong - and genuinely independent - voices in the debates related to information operations and how to respond to them. And to achieve this, one thing - above all - is needed: data.\u00c2\u00a0\nData is the bedrock of a strong civic societal response to information operations. It is vital to allow researchers to detect information operations, understand what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re targeting, what effects they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having, the interests and organisations that are conducting them and measuring the effectiveness of responses to them. It is the way of making the information operations themselves, and the responses to them, transparent and inclusive.\nTransparency is foundational, indeed, to the kind of Internet that we all want to see - empowering consumers, building trust and strengthening democracies. And it is worth noting here that Twitter is the only major service to make public conversation data available via an API, for the purposes of study. Making this type of data available to researchers has resulted in a number of important benefits.\u00c2\u00a0\nFirst, publicly available data can advance research objectives on a wide range of topics and in a safe, compliant way with the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basic expectation of privacy. This has been the case particularly during Covid-19, where we have seen research teams use public Twitter data to map and examine aggregate increases in reported symptoms or anxiety levels.\u00c2\u00a0\nSecond, it raises general awareness and increases understanding more widely of the scale and nature of the challenges impacting the integrity of public conversation online,. This is why in 2018, Twitter committed to disclose publicly, any state-backed information operations that were reliably identified on the service, and to make the full datasets of those operations available for investigation and analysis. Since this first release over two years ago, Twitter has now disclosed over 35 separate state-backed information operations designed to nefariously shape and manipulate public opinion online. Independent analysis of this activity by researchers is a key step toward promoting shared understanding of these threats and to help develop a holistic strategy for addressing them.\nAnd third, making this data available keeps platforms like Twitter accountable for their own response to these challenges. The nature of conversations taking place on Twitter is well-documented and, critically, members of the public, governments, and researchers can bring their expertise to bear to develop solutions for a range of online harms.\u00c2\u00a0However, as Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO, Jack Dorsey has said, there is much more to do when it comes to transparency; and the team within Twitter who work with researchers are part of that, constantly looking for opportunities to provide new data while balancing privacy considerations.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe reality, however, is that there are very different standards for transparency across the industry. One challenge is that so much research of online harms is built on Twitter data because they are one of the few companies to offer it. Another is the amplification of poor quality, non peer-reviewed and misleading \u00e2\u0080\u009cresearch\u00e2\u0080\u009d by some pockets of media and, on occasion, elected officials to suit a predetermined narrative. More broadly, we continue to encourage peer-reviewing of research and data before publication. To not engage in these practices, more often than not, results in public scare-mongering.\nIndependent analysis of these activities by researchers is a key step toward promoting shared understanding of these threats, and this level of transparency can enhance the health of public conversation online, and protect the Open Internet for all. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our shared responsibility in academia, industry, policymaking, and research to consider how greater data transparency and support for civil society can be at the centre of our response to online harms. That need, much like information operations itself, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going anywhere either.\u00c2\u00a0\n___________________________________________________________________________\nOn Thursday 26th November, Twitter and Demos hosted a panel discussion on Data, Research and Information Operations.

According to the United Nations Population Fund, for every three months the COVID-19 lockdown continues, an additional 15 million women are expected to be directly affected by violence. As this so-called \u00e2\u0080\u009cshadow pandemic\u00e2\u0080\u009d continues, Twitter will continue to support nonprofit partners working to bring awareness to the uniquely intense strain the pandemic has had on women.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe recognize that access to a free and open internet is essential, as people across the globe turn to social media services like Twitter to discuss women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights and other important social issues. In fact, women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights have dominated conversations on Twitter this year with 40 million Tweets so far and counting.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition, since the start of COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders, there have been 1 million Tweets per month about domestic violence and related issues. Services like Twitter that rely on the open internet are not only a medium for discussing the issues, but, for many, can be a lifeline and a means to seek help.\nAmplifying the conversation on Twitter\nIn partnership with UN Women and the UN Human Rights Office, we are launching custom emojis to spread awareness on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on November 25 and Human Rights Day on December 10. The emojis will appear when people Tweet with the hashtags #GenerationEquality, #OrangeTheWorld, #16Days, #HumanRightsDay, and other localized hashtags.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are supporting local nonprofits across the world by providing Ads for Good grants to several partners to ensure that they can use the power of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising platform to reach more people. Throughout the next #16Days, we will also amplify various regional campaigns and messages about the importance of gender equality and combatting violence against women to increase engagement and awareness.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have seen the whole world respond to the coronavirus pandemic with all hands on deck, and with responsive investment and protocols backed by determination. Violence against women is also a pandemic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 one that predates the virus and will outlive it. As we face COVID-19\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devastation, there has never been a more important moment to put our combined resources and commitment behind the biggest issues, and work with partners like Twitter to end violence against women and girls for good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director, UN Women\nProviding support and safety resources\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition to elevating the public conversation, we have partnered with health authorities and nonprofit organizations in various markets to expand our #ThereIsHelp notification service. When people search terms associated with gender-based violence on Twitter, they will receive a notification with contact information for local hotlines and other resources to encourage them to reach out for help.\nSince our initial rollout at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have expanded the prompts to reach 24 markets spanning countries such as Australia, India, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, the UK, the US, and more. This month, we rolled out dedicated gender-based violence #ThereIsHelp prompts in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, and Italy to broaden our support and efforts to provide helpful resources to people in need.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThe open internet has played a foundational role in the efforts of social media platforms like Twitter to connect people to helpful resources, healthy conversation, and community.

A year later, we deprioritized this work further to focus on protecting the integrity of the public conversation around critical moments like the 2020 US election. Since then, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been clear about who can become verified and when, why an account might be unverified, or what it means to be verified.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe know how important it is to be able to express yourself and understand who you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking to on Twitter. So today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing the start of our plans to revamp how people can identify themselves on Twitter, starting with verification and asking the public to share feedback on a draft of our new verification policy. Calling for public feedback has become an important part of our policy development process because we want to ensure that, as an open service, our rules reflect the voices of the people who use Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nBuilding our verification policy\nWe plan to relaunch verification, including a new public application process, in early 2021. But first, we need to update our verification policy with your help. This policy will lay the foundation for future improvements by defining what verification means, who is eligible for verification and why some accounts might lose verification to ensure the process is more equitable.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe're starting by more clearly defining some of the core types of Notable Accounts that are served by verification. Per the proposed policy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe blue verified badge on Twitter lets people know that an account of public interest is authentic. To receive the blue badge, your account must be notable and active.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\nThe six types of accounts we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve identified to start are:\nGovernment\nCompanies, Brands and Non- Profit Organizations\nNews\nEntertainment\nSports\nActivists, Organizers, and Other Influential Individuals\nYou can find more detailed definitions of the criteria above in the draft policy here.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also added proposed criteria to automatically remove verification from an account if, for example, it's inactive or if the profile is incomplete, as well as grounds to deny or remove verification from certain qualified accounts that are found to be in repeated violation of the Twitter Rules. We recognize that there are many verified accounts on Twitter who should not be. We plan to start by automatically removing badges from accounts that are inactive or have incomplete profiles to help streamline our work and to expand this to include additional types of accounts over the course of 2021.\nWe know we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve verification with a new policy alone -- and that this initial policy won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cover every case for being verified -- but it is a critical first step in helping us provide more transparency and fairer standards for verification on Twitter as we reprioritize this work. This version of the policy is a starting point, and we intend to expand the categories and criteria for verification significantly over the next year.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe want to hear from you\nWhat do you think? Here is a brief survey\u00c2\u00a0on our draft verification policy. We are also working with local non-governmental organizations and our Trust and Safety Council to ensure as many perspectives are represented as possible.\nIf you prefer to Tweet your feedback, we'll be listening there, too. Use the hashtag #VerificationFeedback. \nThe public feedback period starts today, November 24, 2020, and continues until December 8, 2020. At that point, we'll review public feedback on this policy and train our teams on this new approach. Our goal is to introduce the final policy on December 17, 2020. \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to serving the public conversation by helping people find credible information, hear important voices, and trust the authenticity of the accounts people find on Twitter. Thank you for taking the time to be part of this process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we look forward to hearing what you think. \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? \nBeing able to express yourself is core to the public conversation, and who you talk to is as important as what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying. We want to make space for everyone on Twitter to express their authentic voices by giving people more ways to identify themselves in their Profiles. The blue verified badge and account labels are two of the ways we help distinguish notable, authentic accounts on Twitter. This year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve verified medical experts Tweeting about #COVID19 and added account labels to identify candidates running for office.\u00c2\u00a0\nBut the blue verified badge isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only way we are planning to distinguish accounts on Twitter. Heading into 2021, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to giving people more ways to identify themselves, such as new account types and labels. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share more in the coming weeks. This is just the beginning of what we have planned for 2021.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@TwitterSupport\n#VerificationFeedback\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

But some of you tell us that Tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there's so much pressure to rack up Retweets and Likes. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why, unfortunately, there are so many \u00f0\u009f\u0094\u00a5 Tweets left in drafts! To help people feel more comfortable, we've been working on a lower pressure way for people to talk about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. Today, we're launching Fleets so everyone can easily join the conversation in a new way \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with their fleeting thoughts.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFleets are for sharing momentary thoughts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 they help start conversations and only stick around for 24 hours. Through our tests in Brazil, Italy, India, and South Korea, we learned Fleets helped people feel more comfortable joining the conversation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we saw people with Fleets talk more on Twitter. Those new to Twitter found Fleets to be an easier way to share what's on their mind. Because they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings. These are early findings from our tests and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to learn more about how Fleets are used by you.\nYou can Fleet text, reactions to Tweets, photos or videos and customize your Fleets with various background and text options. To share a Tweet in a Fleet tap the \u00e2\u0080\u009cShare\u00e2\u0080\u009d icon at the bottom of the Tweet and then tap, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShare in Fleet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then, add what you think about it with some text or emojis.

Anyone who can see your full profile can see your Fleets there too. Also, anyone who can send you a Direct Message can reply to your Fleets. If you want to reply to a Fleet, tap on it to send a Direct Message or emoji reaction to the author; replying or reacting to a Fleet starts a conversation in your Direct Messages. Fleet authors can see who views their Fleets, including accounts with protected Tweets, by clicking into their Fleets and tapping on the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Seen By\u00e2\u0080\u0099 text at the bottom. Learn more about how Fleets work here. Fleets will be updated over time with new features, based on your feedback. \nJust like Tweets, Fleets must follow the Twitter Rules. To report a Fleet, tap the \u00e2\u0080\u0098v\u00e2\u0080\u0099 icon at the top of a Fleet; you can also mute the account posting the Fleet from here. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take action if a reported Tweet breaks our rules. If you Fleet a Tweet with a label or warning, it will carry over to Fleets. In some cases, you may need to tap through a warning before you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to view a Fleet.\nThis format may sound familiar to you!

This is the exact approach we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented on Tweets about COVID-19, synthetic and manipulated media, and the 2020 US election that could contribute to offline harm. We continue to apply labels to add context and limit the risk of harmful election misinformation spreading without important context.  Below are some key statistics about the labels, warnings, and additional restrictions we applied to Tweets that included potentially misleading information about the US Election from October 27 to November 11: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nApproximately 300,000 Tweets have been labeled under our\u00c2\u00a0Civic Integrity Policy\u00c2\u00a0for content that was disputed and potentially misleading. These represent 0.2% of all US election-related Tweets sent during this time period.\n456 of those Tweets were also covered by a warning message and had engagement features limited (Tweets could be Quote Tweeted but not Retweeted, replied to or liked).\nApproximately 74% of the people who viewed those Tweets saw them after we applied a label or warning message.\nWe saw an estimated 29% decrease in Quote Tweets of these labeled Tweets due in part to a prompt that warned people prior to sharing.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe also got ahead of potentially misleading information by showing everyone on Twitter in the US a series of pre-bunk prompts. These prompts, which were seen 389 million times, appeared in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home timelines and in Search, and reminded people that election results were likely to be delayed, and that voting by mail is safe and legitimate.  These enforcement actions remain part of our continued strategy to add context and limit the spread of misleading information about election processes around the world on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nProduct changes In the weeks leading up to and during election week, we implemented significant product changes intended to increase context and encourage more thoughtful consideration before Tweets are amplified. Starting today, we are reverting some of these changes and providing more detail on the impact they had.  Encouraging Quote Tweets We encouraged people to add their own commentary when amplifying content by prompting Quote Tweets instead of Retweets. This change introduced some friction, and gave people an extra moment to consider why and what they were adding to the conversation. Since making this change, we observed a 23% decrease in Retweets and a 26% increase in Quote Tweets, but on a net basis the overall number of Retweets and Quote Tweets combined decreased by 20%. In short, this change slowed the spread of misleading information by virtue of an overall reduction in the amount of sharing on the service. We are taking more time to study and fully understand the impact of this change and are leaving it in-place for now. \nUpdated on December 16, 2020: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no longer be prompting Quote Tweets, and are re-enabling the standard Retweet behavior. We hoped this change would encourage thoughtful amplification and also increase the likelihood that people would add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation. However, we observed that prompting Quote Tweets didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to increase context: 45% of additional Quote Tweets included just a single word and 70% contained less than 25 characters. \nRemoving Tweet recommendations in Home Timeline & Notifications We stopped providing \u00e2\u0080\u009cliked by\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfollowed by\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tweet recommendations from accounts you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow in the Home Timeline and through notifications. While we had initially hoped that this would help reduce the potential for misleading information to spread on our service, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in misinformation prevalence as a result of this change (nor any meaningful reduction in abuse reports). Instead, we found that pausing these recommendations prevented many people from discovering new conversations and accounts to follow. As of today, we are reverting this change.  Our goal is to eventually replace these \u00e2\u0080\u009cliked by\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfollowed by\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations with ones that are based on the Topics you follow or Topics we think you might like. We believe this will provide you greater control to tell us what you are and aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interested in, which will make our recommendations more relevant to you. Also, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike\u00e2\u0080\u009d button provides sufficient, thoughtful consideration prior to amplifying Tweets. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown our coverage of Topics recommendations significantly in the last year, with now more than 5,000 Topics available, and hope to be able to complete this transition soon.  Required context before showing Trends in \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d We only showed Trends in \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d that had added context, meaning our team added a description, representative Tweet, or article to help people more quickly gain an informed understanding of high volume public conversation.  While we saw a significant reduction in reports (on Trends, and Tweets within Trends result pages) as a result of this change, we also recognized that it placed a significant limitation on the number and breadth of Trends that we could show people, making \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d less relevant for many people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interests. Moving forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to prioritize reviewing and adding context to as many Trends as possible, but won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make this a requirement before a Trend can appear in \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our goal is to help people see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, while ensuring that potentially misleading trends are presented with context.  Next steps We remain vigilant and will continue working to protect the integrity of the election conversation on Twitter. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done for many elections around the world, we will produce a longer-form retrospective of all of our work around the 2020 US Election in early 2021. We will continue to research, question, and change features that may incentivize or encourage behaviors on Twitter that negatively affect the health of the public conversation.

Additionally, as of January 25, 2022, Website Click Campaigns are now known and referred to as Website Traffic Campaigns.\nLast updated: August 16th, 2022\nScaling our performance advertising and measurement solutions for advertisers\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share that the new and improved Twitter Pixel, Conversion API, and App Purchase Optimization are launching globally to all Twitter Advertisers. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hard at work since our last update, and have now hit an important milestone that creates value on top of the measurement and optimization solutions we launched earlier this year.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a closer look at what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been up to:\u00c2\u00a0\nOur new and improved Twitter Pixel\nThe new Twitter Pixel is a new measurement solution that enables conversion tracking. Conversion tracking is the backbone of performance advertising - it enables advertisers to measure their return on ad spend by tracking the actions people take after viewing, clicking or engaging with ads on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat does the new Twitter Pixel do?\u00c2\u00a0\nImproved Web attribution: This new Pixel comes with additional functionality, such as allowing advertisers to measure more actions than before, such as when someone adds an item to their digital shopping cart.\u00c2\u00a0\nEasier measurement set-up and troubleshooting: We also simplified our event creation process, which helps advertisers more seamlessly set up their measurement solutions, and introduced updates to our Pixel Helper Chrome extension. This will help advertisers better understand the impact of their web campaigns and provide clearer support when checking to see if the Pixel is implemented properly.\nIntroducing: Conversion API (CAPI)\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are also introducing Conversion API (CAPI) to all advertisers. CAPI is a measurement solution that enables advertisers to connect to our API endpoint and send conversion events to Twitter from their servers without using third-party cookies. This launch is a part of our efforts to improve value for businesses while maintaining our privacy and security commitments by relying less on third-party cookies.\u00c2\u00a0\nCAPI can also help improve optimization and ad targeting without the need for a Twitter Pixel, which is the first time an advertiser can finally connect data to see conversions without placing a tag on their site. Multiple data signals with Conversion API (CAPI) can be used\u00e2\u0080\u0094including Twitter Click ID or email addresses to send conversion events to the API endpoint and help advertisers further understand actions that people are taking as a result of their advertising.\u00c2\u00a0\nYou can read more about how advertisers are tapping into CAPI in this success story, and more about the Twitter Pixel and Conversions API on the Twitter Ads Help Center.\u00c2\u00a0\nIntroducing: App Purchase Optimization\u00c2\u00a0\nIn the world of App ads, performance talks - and the performance that most app advertisers care about are not simply installs, but driving lower funnel actions such as purchases. We are taking the first step towards fulfilling our promise of making Twitter a great place for driving lower funnel outcomes for performance advertisers with App Purchase Optimization.\nApp Purchase Optimization enables advertisers to deliver ads to people most likely to install an app or make a purchase by using machine learning to identify audiences that are more likely to take an action. In early testing* we saw the following results:\u00c2\u00a0\n89% of advertisers saw a reduction in cost-per-purchase\nA median 30.4% decrease in cost-per-purchase compared to Install Optimization, when using Click Billing and a median 12.8% decrease in cost-per-purchase compared to Install Optimization, when using Impressions Billing\nThis product is now currently available via Android for all advertisers, with an iOS launch to follow in the future.\u00c2\u00a0\n*Source: Data from internal Twitter testing in Q2 2022 comparing campaigns optimizing for Purchases vs. campaigns optimizing for Installs.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you need help setting up your campaign,\u00c2\u00a0connect with a Twitter Ads specialist.\nLooking ahead\u00c2\u00a0\nTo build a more effective performance advertising business, we are increasing our investment across various initiatives, including updates to our optimization models, conversion options, and measurement solutions. As we continue to build upon our performance roadmap, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to continue to drive value for our customers with upcoming product launches, such as:\u00c2\u00a0\nCollection Ads: This new format will bring a new way for advertisers to storytell and showcase their products to consumers. Brands can display a primary hero image with smaller thumbnail visuals below. Each image can drive consumers to a different website or product landing page, driving various advertiser objectives.\u00c2\u00a0\nWeb Conversion Optimization: We will be conducting a major rebuild of our Website Conversions optimization model that will help improve the way we reach people who are more likely to convert on a lower-funnel Website action, such as making a purchase or adding an item to their cart.\u00c2\u00a0\nDynamic Product Ads: This is a new ad product that will dynamically deliver relevant products to the right person, at the right time, based on their activity both on and off Twitter, in order to help drive sales or conversions.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe work continues and we are looking forward to sharing more along the way.

Based on the expanded product offering and to better meet your expectations of the results you can achieve from this product, we are renaming this objective to Website Traffic.\u00c2\u00a0\nSite Visits Optimization is a new optimization goal under the Website Traffic objective dedicated to finding and serving your ads to audiences most likely to visit your website. By enabling the Twitter Website Tag, Twitter is able to track actions that audiences take on an advertiser's website and attribute them to their Twitter ads campaigns.\nIn testing with advertisers who had website traffic goals, Site Visits Optimization outperformed existing offerings and saw an average lower cost-per-site-visit of 31%.*\u00c2\u00a0\nBuilding off of the updates made to improve our mid-funnel offerings, our teams will be focused on the development of new product features that will expand on ad conversions (for example, adding items to a cart or driving purchases) to better help you drive your business outcomes.\u00c2\u00a0\nFind more information on Site Visits Optimization.\u00c2\u00a0\n*Source: Twitter funded advertiser tests conducted November through December 2021, comparing performance between 15 website campaigns using Site Visits Optimization and 15 website campaigns using Conversions Optimization and optimizing for a Site Visit event.\nIntroducing attribution with Aggregated Measurement\nSince Apple's App Tracking Transparency launched last year, we have been working to evolve our products to improve value for businesses while maintaining our commitments to consumers. This is aimed at providing conversion metrics by counting events in aggregate for audiences who have opted out of tracking on iOS devices.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow does this work?\u00c2\u00a0\nWithin the Twitter Ads Manager Reporting you will be able to see an aggregated view of site metrics and conversion events, giving you a more complete view of your campaign results.\nThis is an exciting development and, though results may vary depending on the advertiser or the campaign details, we saw, on average, a 31% increase in attributable Site Visit Conversions** in Twitter Ads Manager, across advertiser campaigns.\nThis will be a potential improvement for advertisers who have seen a decrease in attribution across their campaigns after the implementation of Apple's new ATT App Tracking Transparency Framework.\u00c2\u00a0\nFind more Information on Aggregated Measurement.\n**Source: Data was pulled through our backend attribution system from 12/17/2021-1/13/2022 across all advertiser campaigns, reporting on the attributable Site Visit conversions across all OS platforms (iOS, Desktop, Android, Other) with Aggregated Measurement enabled compared to not being enabled. Results may vary depending on the advertiser or the campaign details.\nIntroducing Events Manager\u00c2\u00a0\nAs our performance solutions are built out and improved, we want to ensure that you are able to efficiently and effectively manage tracking your ad campaigns.\u00c2\u00a0\nEvents Manager will become the centralized hub to manage your Twitter Website Tag and its associated web-based conversion events. This update includes the following foundational updates:\nStreamlined interface that provides more clarity on setting up your Twitter Website Tag\u00c2\u00a0\nClearer prompts to provide guidance on how to set up your conversion events\u00c2\u00a0\nPromptly see updates on the tracking status of your conversion events\u00c2\u00a0\nThroughout this year we will continue to provide enhancements to Events Manager to improve diagnostic capabilities, further streamline the interface, and integrate App-based events so this can become the central hub for advertisers to manage their website tag and conversion events.\nFind more Information on Events Manager.\n2022 will be a banner year for performance\u00c2\u00a0\nWe see a lot of opportunities for us to continue to improve how businesses run advertising campaigns on Twitter, these are just three of the foundational updates we are excited to bring to market at the start of the year. In 2022, you can expect even more updates as we continue to make it easier for you to grow your business and understand the performance and impact of your ad campaigns.\u00c2\u00a0\n          A year in Performance\n        \nWe have come a long way since we created this Performance hub as a way to be transparent about our efforts to help meet the needs of more marketers and their performance goals. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share the latest progress we are making against our Performance ads product roadmap. We continue to work off the foundations we have rebuilt and are launching key App and Web products in-market.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs part of our broader Performance advertising strategy, our first focus has been to drive app discovery for people, while supporting app developers in growing their user acquisition and increasing their return on investment. Our second area of focus is on driving action to websites: we are exploring the development of ad products that help people find relevant information and products, or guide them to take action on a website. These elements could unlock the ability for us to enable advertisers to drive discovery of goods and services, eventually supporting our broader commerce opportunities.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are no stranger to the new platform standards influencing digital advertising, such as Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s App Tracking Transparency enforcement that began in April. These shifts in the industry are an opportunity for us to move quickly and help our partners navigate these changes as effectively as possible. We continue to build our products with these privacy-focused developments at the core of all we do.\nApp Installs: Building upon our progress\nWe made significant progress to delivering a performant App Installs objective, which helps advertisers drive installs to their app(s). With a privacy-led mindset, we heavily invested in supporting SKAdNetwork to enable post App Tracking Transparency user acquisition. Our work here allowed us to open up over 30%+ more inventory and scale on iOS after enabling privacy-preserved measurement. We then quickly launched support of view-through attribution and SK-campaign ID management features in Twitter Ads Manager, in addition to updated optimization models.\u00c2\u00a0\nSupporting our partners through these changes is not limited to investment in SKAdNetwork alone. We continued to iterate off of our\u00c2\u00a0rebuilt foundation,\u00c2\u00a0launching new Ad Format improvements to reduce download friction, releasing an updated Learning Period model aimed at driving more consistent campaign performance, and making additional improvements to campaign creation.\nImage of an overlaid install action pops up in-feed, allowing people to immediately download the app.\nWe are also actively planning and testing for the next iteration of App Installs on Twitter. This will include:\u00c2\u00a0\nMore unique formats to engage audiences\nUpdated optimization models\nDevelopment of new post-install products, such as In-App Purchase Optimization, which would allow advertisers to run campaigns focused on finding people more likely to make in-app purchases\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWebsite Traffic: Introducing Multi-Destination Carousels\nWe also made progress on our Website Traffic product, which helps advertisers drive traffic to websites. Last year, we announced the\u00c2\u00a0launch of Carousel Ads.\u00c2\u00a0We are pleased to share that we are now launching multi-destination functionality for Carousels driving to a website. With Multi-Destination Carousels, advertisers can now customize headlines and landing pages to help drive the right actions for their audiences.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdvertisers will have greater flexibility to diversify their message with unique headlines and URLs per Carousel Card. With just a swipe, people can engage with multiple images or videos, and click through to land on different destinations.\nWe are encouraged by the results we saw during our Beta testing of this new functionality. For Multi-Destination Website Carousels, we saw on average:\u00c2\u00a0\n~20% increase in click-through rate across all objectives, relative to single-asset ads*\n~25% lift in click-through rate for campaigns that optimize for site visit conversions, relative to single-asset ads*\nWe are also testing additional key Website Traffic products, including:\u00c2\u00a0\nSite Visit Optimization, an improved buying model dedicated to finding and serving ads to audiences most likely to visit an advertiser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website.\nAd formats, identifying opportunities to improve ad engagement on Twitter. These tests include updates to usability, format details, and calls-to-action.\nMeasurement & Reporting, actively testing and building 1st party measurement and experimentation solutions for a privacy-preserved future for our Website ad products.\u00c2\u00a0\nJust getting started\nWe see our Performance advertising products as discovery tools. They should be able to help our partners bring people to the relevant goods and services that are important to them. If Twitter is to become a place for commerce, discovery will need to be effective and accessible. In order to make this all work, we also need to build the right organic tools and resources for businesses, which we are doing in our recent work for Twitter for Professionals.\nAll of these advances have put us in a strong position for the next phase of Performance advertising on Twitter. While this is an exciting milestone, it is still an early step. We have more work ahead of us, and are looking forward to continuing to share our progress.\n*Source: Twitter internal data from Carousels while in Beta testing July - September 2021.

Since we last shared an update, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built on our recent Carousel Ads launch, and we concluded two crucial product milestones: the rebuilds of our App Installs and Website Traffic objectives. \nThese rebuilds are focused on getting our fundamentals right, and include improvements across five areas: Campaign management, Quality Supply, Ad Formats, Optimization, and Measurement. Our commitment to developing the critical tools that advertisers need to launch campaigns and drive customer acquisition is working - and we are excited to share more about the progress we have made.\u00c2\u00a0\nCompleted the rebuild of our App Installs objective\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve rebuilt the foundation of our App Installs objective to help advertisers launch, manage, and measure app install campaigns even better than before. As part of this rebuild, we redesigned several of our most popular formats to drive higher engagement, increased mobile app impressions by 80%1, improved prediction and measurement, and developed a faster and more intuitive campaign creation experience.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a look at the changes we have made:\u00c2\u00a0\nEnhanced creative formats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 In addition to our recent new and improved Carousels announcement, we also made improvements to Twitter App Cards, making them even more engaging than before by adding more context and information, such as app ratings, app price, and download details \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of which help us better serve up-and-coming apps by giving them more credibility. This has led to a +8.88% install per impression improvement2.\u00c2\u00a0\nImproved prediction and supply \u00e2\u0080\u0094 We launched a combination of prediction, bid optimization, supply and supply quality improvements to deliver more stability and performance. We also upgraded our infrastructure and how our ad serving works within the Twitter timeline, which has resulted in a significant number of impressions that App Install advertisers are now winning in our auction.\nEasier campaign setup and management \u00e2\u0080\u0094 We improved aspects of the Ads Manager experience to be more intuitive. This includes a single tab Tweet creation experience for advertisers to build their entire creative in one go, reducing the amount of time and number of interfaces advertisers must navigate. We also updated our Ad Group Details page to simplify optimization and bidding combinations.\u00c2\u00a0\nImproved Measurement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Lastly, we implemented measurement solutions to help advertisers more accurately attribute installs and navigate iOS 14\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upcoming app tracking transparency framework (ATT). You can read more about our approach specific to the ATT changes here. We also expanded our Advanced Mobile Measurement Program, allowing advertisers to enable advertisers to conduct LTV and ROAS measurement.\nIntroducing Twitter Click ID and improved conversion optimization\nFor advertisers focused on driving website outcomes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been hard at work improving formats, measurement, and optimization models to increase click-to-land rates and reduce reporting discrepancies between Twitter reporting and third-party reporting.\nAs the industry shifts away from using third-party cookies to determine if an ad resulted in a site visit, we improved the Twitter Website Tag (javascript version) by developing a first-party click ID parameter. Twitter Click ID provides a reliable method to measure the people who visited a site after clicking on a Twitter ad, and reduces measurement discrepancies, giving advertisers better data and a long-term measurement solution in a cookie-less advertising world.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow it works\nWhen someone clicks on a website ad, the Twitter Click ID\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unique identifier will be appended automatically in the URL. When the person lands on the website and the Twitter pixel fires, this ID will be captured, sent to Twitter, and used to attribute the site visit to the click. Based on our test results, we have seen a 10X increase in Site Visits3\u00c2\u00a0reported in Twitter Ads Manager.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe also upgraded our conversion optimization model, improving campaigns that optimize for site visits. Our system is now better at identifying people who are more likely to visit your website. In recent testing, we observed a median increase in click-to-land rate of +26% and a significant decrease in cost per site visit4\u00c2\u00a0in Twitter Ads Manager.\nAdditionally, we made improvements to the Website Card format - including better navigation to a full-screen browser, reduced loading time for websites, and improved usability of media controls - all of which resulted in a click-to-land rate improvement of +8%5.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next\nOur focus is on making it easier and more efficient\u00c2\u00a0 than ever to advertise on Twitter - helping advertisers reach a full-funnel marketing approach from the top-down.\nThese products can help marketers take their launches and campaigns and extend them into always-on media plans that may ultimately help marketers drive customer acquisition and reach their goals. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re so excited for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next - stay tuned for more.\u00c2\u00a0\nFootnotes:\n1Based on growth in on-platform MAP ad impressions in Q4 2020\n2As compared to current production version of the card in an A/B experiment, Q4 2020\n3As compared to the same set of campaigns without Click ID enabled, Q4 2020\n4As compared to the same campaign without conversion optimization enabled, Q4 2020\n5As compared to the control bucket in each experiment, Q4 2020\n\u00a0\n          Introducing New and Improved Carousels\n        \nUpdated November 2020\u00c2\u00a0\nWe know there is an opportunity to better equip businesses on Twitter to run advertising campaigns that help them effectively reach their goals, whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving people to websites or to download mobile apps. We have been hard at work on a roadmap that will help us deliver better performance at a greater scale and establish a more efficient performance-driven advertising business on Twitter. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a lot of progress in the last year, which include:\u00c2\u00a0\nRebuilding our\u00c2\u00a0ad platform architecture, which improved the state of our systems and reinforced the foundation of Twitter's ad business.\nLaunching our Advanced Mobile Measurement (AMM) program, to give advertisers enhanced measurement of Lifetime value.\nReleasing\u00c2\u00a0the new Tweet Composer\u00c2\u00a0to help enable faster creative development and iteration.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdding support of SKAdNetwork, Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attribution service, to attribute installs and provide campaign reporting for iOS 14.\nImproving our advertising algorithms, such as the launch of Learning Period, which allows our prediction models to learn and optimize campaign delivery.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis investment in performance advertising also includes expanding the capabilities of our ad formats to enable advertisers with more options to show and tell their brand story, while providing a more intuitive, engaging experience for people on Twitter. We recently redesigned the video controls on our Video Website Cards to make it easier for people to navigate, and launched improvements to our App Cards.\u00c2\u00a0\nAnd today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share the global release of the new and improved Carousel ads, now available to all.\u00c2\u00a0\nCarousel ads are designed to help drive better performance by providing a more immersive and interactive experience for consumers to engage with, as well as enable future opportunities within our Mobile App and Website performance objectives. We are excited to share that this ad format is now available to all advertisers, globally.\u00c2\u00a0\nCarousel ads are made up of two to six horizontally swipeable images or videos that drive people to an app or website. Any advertiser can create Carousel ads via Tweet Composer in Ads Manager or via the Ads API, and is able to use them either organically or promoted.\nThe Carousel ad format also includes an edge-to-edge design, 3rd party measurement reporting, accessibility support, and new reporting features, such as swipes within the Carousel and breakdowns to measure individual Carousel card performance.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are encouraged by the strong results we saw during our Beta testing:\u00c2\u00a0\nFor Website Carousels, we saw on average, a ~15% increase in click-through rate relative to single-asset formats*.\nAnd for App Carousels, we saw on average, a ~24% increase in installs per impression relative to single-asset formats*.\nWe expect these results to change in general availability, and to vary across different regions, platforms and industries, however it is a positive sign as we release this format globally and continue to invest in performance products.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\u00c2\u00a0\nThis is an early step in our journey. To build a more effective performance advertising business, we are increasing our investment across various initiatives, including updates to our Mobile App objectives, such as stronger bidding and optimization options, enhancements to the Twitter Website Tag that aim to drive up the accuracy of key advertiser campaign metrics, such as return on ad spend, and improved creative advertising formats.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot more for us to do, but we are encouraged by what we have accomplished thus far and the clear path ahead. We will be updating this page with all our performance-specific developments in the upcoming months, so be sure to check back in!\u00c2\u00a0\nMore information\nLearn more about\u00c2\u00a0Carousel Ads on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\n*Averages across Image & Video Carousels across iOS & Android compared to single-asset Cards.

We used this as an opportunity to re-introduce Twitter Able with a new campaign that represents who we are, what we do, and our intersections: #DisabledAndAble. We want it known that people can be both disabled workers and able workers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that disabled employees are not less than, not there to simply accommodate. Disabled employees are equal employees who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspectives make Twitter, and the world, better for all.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter Able began a year ago, as a community of disabled and ally Tweeps working together to raise awareness, provide resources, and prioritize the needs of our community. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one of nine global Business Resource Groups (BRGs), working toward making Twitter a more inclusive and accessible company. Our work also includes healthy conversations with the people who use Twitter, as to further understand all that we can do to foster belonging. In a virtual world, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no better time to work together, and closer, even while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re apart.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs two engineers on Twitter Able we stayed busy this month with #DisabledAndAble global programming.

And although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re one BRG, our shared experiences range across intersectional identities, job functions, and interests - throughout Twitter. In a world where there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much uncertainty, accountability is prime for our progress. With 200+ global members, our work, advocacy, and community is evergrowing - not because of our numbers but because of our proximity to the problems we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re solving.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t perfect and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot of work to do to make Twitter a more inclusive and accessible company.

But we know that this cannot be achieved unless the integrity of this critical dialogue on Twitter is protected from attempts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 both foreign and domestic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to undermine it.\nToday, we're announcing additional, significant product and enforcement updates that will increase context and encourage more thoughtful consideration before Tweets are amplified.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow our Civic Integrity Policy applies on and around Election night\nWe do not allow anyone to use Twitter to manipulate or interfere in elections or other civic processes, and recently expanded our civic integrity policy to address how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll handle misleading information surrounding these events. Under this policy, we will label Tweets that falsely claim a win for any candidate and will remove Tweets that encourage violence or call for people to interfere with election results or the smooth operation of polling places. More specifically:\nPeople on Twitter, including candidates for office, may not claim an election win before it is authoritatively called. To determine the results of an election in the US, we require either an announcement from state election officials, or a public projection from at least two authoritative, national news outlets that make independent election calls. Tweets which include premature claims will be labeled and direct people to our official US election page.\nTweets meant to incite interference with the election process or with the implementation of election results, such as through violent action, will be subject to removal. This covers all Congressional races and the Presidential Election.\n New prompts and more warnings on misleading Tweets\nWe currently may label Tweets that violate our policies against misleading information about civic integrity, COVID-19, and synthetic and manipulated media. Starting next week, when people attempt to Retweet one of these Tweets with a misleading information label, they will see a prompt pointing them to credible information about the topic before they are able to amplify it.\nTweets with labels are already de-amplified through our own recommendation systems and these new prompts will give individuals more context on labeled Tweets so they can make more informed decisions on whether or not they want to amplify them to their followers.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn addition to these prompts, we will now add additional warnings and restrictions on Tweets with a misleading information label from US political figures (including candidates and campaign accounts), US-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers, or that obtain significant engagement. People must tap through a warning to see these Tweets, and then will only be able to Quote Tweet; likes, Retweets and replies will be turned off, and these Tweets won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be algorithmically recommended by Twitter. We expect this will further reduce the visibility of misleading information, and will encourage people to reconsider if they want to amplify these Tweets.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            This label is for illustrative purposes only.\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nEncouraging more consideration\u00c2\u00a0\nBeginning October 20 through at least the end of Election week in the US, when we will assess their continued necessity, we will also introduce the following changes globally to Twitter:\nFirst, we will encourage people to add their own commentary prior to amplifying content by prompting them to Quote Tweet instead of Retweet. People who go to Retweet will be brought to the Quote Tweet composer where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be encouraged to comment before sending their Tweet. Though this adds some extra friction for those who simply want to Retweet, we hope it will encourage everyone to not only consider why they are amplifying a Tweet, but also increase the likelihood that people add their own thoughts, reactions and perspectives to the conversation. If people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add anything on the Quote Tweet composer, it will still appear as a Retweet. We will begin testing this change on Twitter.com for some people beginning today.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSecond, we will prevent \u00e2\u0080\u009cliked by\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfollowed by\u00e2\u0080\u009d recommendations from people you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow from showing up in your timeline and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t send notifications for these Tweets. These recommendations can be a helpful way for people to see relevant conversations from outside of their network, but we are removing them because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe the \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike\u00e2\u0080\u009d button provides sufficient, thoughtful consideration prior to amplifying Tweets to people who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow the author of the Tweet, or the relevant topic that the Tweet is about. This will likely slow down how quickly Tweets from accounts and topics you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow can reach you, which we believe is a worthwhile sacrifice to encourage more thoughtful and explicit amplification.\nFinally, we will only surface Trends in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d tab in the United States that include additional context. That means there will be a description Tweet or article that represents or summarizes why that term is trending. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been adding more context to Trends during the last few months, but this change will ensure that only Trends with added context show up in the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor You\u00e2\u0080\u009d tab in the United States, which is where the vast majority of people discover what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trending. This will help people more quickly gain an informed understanding of the high volume public conversation in the US and also help reduce the potential for misleading information to spread.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nConstantly working to protect elections\nThe improvements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re announcing today are the latest in our comprehensive effort to apply the lessons of 2016, and from elections that have happened around the world since, to the 2020 US Election. This is exemplified in our efforts surrounding the last US Midterm Election through this month:\n9/2018 - Encouraged voter registration for all Americans during the 2018 midterm elections\n10/2018 - Tightened our policies and zero-tolerance approach to hacked materials\n10/2018 - Produced, and continue to update,\u00c2\u00a0 the only archive in the entire industry of state-backed information operations\n1/2019 - Issued a comprehensive review of our efforts to protect the 2018 U.S. midterms\n6/2019 - Launched public interest notice and defined our approach on public interest\n10/2019 - Banned all political ads on Twitter, including ads from state-controlled media\n12/2019 - Added Election Labels to candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts\n2/2020 - Introduced our rules on and labels for synthetic and manipulated media\n3/2020 - Held planning exercises to prepare for a variety of Election Day scenarios\n5/2020 - Added labels and warnings to potentially harmful misleading information\u00c2\u00a0\n8/2020 - Deployed labels on government and state-affiliated media accounts\n9/2020 - Implemented account security requirements for high-profile political accounts\n9/2020 - Built a U.S. Election hub containing credible news and voting resources\n9/2020 - Encouraged voter registration and emphasizing safe voting options\n9/2020 - Expanded our civic integrity policy to include specifics around pre and post election day\nTwitter has a critical role to play in protecting the integrity of the election conversation, and we encourage candidates, campaigns, news outlets and voters to use Twitter respectfully and to recognize our collective responsibility to the electorate to guarantee a safe, fair and legitimate democratic process this November. As with any other product change, we will learn, observe, and iterate based on the impact of these changes, to inform both our strategy around future global elections and Twitter's overall product experience.\nIn addition to these changes, as we have throughout the election period, we will have teams around the world working to monitor the integrity of the conversation and take action when needed. We have already increased the size and capacity of our teams focused on the US Election and will have the necessary staffing to respond rapidly to issues that may arise on Twitter on Election night and in the days that follow.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor more updates as the election continues, please follow @TwitterGov.\n###\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis has been updated November 2, 2020, with updated information below on labeling election results. \nOffering further details on our plans for Election results\nBecause this is an unusual election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 restrictions in response to COVID-19 have led to historically high numbers of mail-in ballots, which may result in some state results not being resolved on election night \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we are taking additional steps to provide context when results have not been officially called. We believe this is the right thing to do to protect the integrity of the conversation around the election while counting is ongoing and before results are announced by state authorities. Beginning on election night through the inauguration, we will label some Tweets that make claims about election results. We will be prioritizing the presidential election and other highly contested races where there may be significant issues with misleading information based on the below criteria.\nWho is eligible for a label?\nAll accounts with US 2020 candidate labels (including US 2020 Presidential candidate and campaign accounts)\nUS-based accounts with more than 100,000 followers\nTweets that have significant engagement (25k likes or 25k Quote Tweets and/or Retweets).\nWho do we consider official sources for election results?\nState election officials (as determined by the National Association of Secretaries of State and the National Association of State Election Directors)\nNational news outlets that have dedicated, independent election decision desks:\n-ABC News -Associated Press -CBS News -CNN -Decision Desk HQ -Fox News -National Election Pool -NBC News -Reuters\nThe official Twitter accounts of these news organizations, as well as Tweets directly citing a call from these news organizations, will be exempted from labels about election results.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nelections\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

The accounts that we have published in our archive today - the only archive of its kind in the industry - include independent information operations that we have attributed to Iran, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, Thailand and Russia.\u00c2\u00a0\nPost-investigation, we permanently suspended all 1,594 accounts associated with the five networks, for various violations of our platform manipulation policies. Along with our enforcement, we shared early access to the data we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re releasing today with the Stanford Internet Observatory\u00c2\u00a0(SIO) for independent investigation and analysis.\nIran\nBased on information shared by industry peers, we identified a network of primarily compromised accounts on Twitter operating from Iran, which artificially amplified conversations on politically sensitive topics, including Black Lives Matter (BLM), the murder of George Floyd, and other issues of racial and social justice in the United States.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn cases where we identify that an account has been compromised for the purposes of engaging in violative behavior, we aim to restore the account to the original account holder. We were able to do so successfully in most cases here. In all, we suspended a total of 104 accounts connected with this campaign.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo protect the privacy of people whose accounts were used without permission for this campaign, we are hashing all user-identifiable information connected with this set across all the data we are releasing.\nSaudi Arabia\u00c2\u00a0\nWe investigated and removed 33 accounts originating in Saudi Arabia, with ties to the Saudi government. These accounts were created to impersonate key Qatari political figures and to advance narratives about Qatari politics which are geostrategically favorable to the Saudi authorities.\u00c2\u00a0 \nCuba\u00c2\u00a0\nWe have permanently suspended 526 fake accounts run by youth organizations with ties to the Cuban government, including Uni\u00c3\u00b3n de J\u00c3\u00b3venes Comunistas (UJC) and\u00c2\u00a0Federaci\u00c3\u00b3n Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU).\nThailand\nOur investigation uncovered a network of accounts partaking in information operations that we can reliably link to the Royal Thai Army (RTA). These accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content, as well as engaging in behavior targeting prominent political opposition figures.\nWe are disclosing 926 accounts today and continue to enforce against small-scale activity associated with this network, as we identify it.\u00c2\u00a0\nRussia\u00c2\u00a0\nWe communicated proactively about this set of five accounts at the beginning of September 2020. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding them to the archive.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWorking collaboratively with industry peers and the FBI, we were made aware of a number of accounts that had potential links to a fake news agency called PeaceData. They were immediately removed from the service and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve marked all links to the site as unsafe across the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur work in this area\u00c2\u00a0\nOur goal with these disclosures is to continue to build public understanding around the ways in which state actors try to abuse and undermine open democratic conversation. To build on this mission we hosted an online conference this summer with Carnegie that brought together industry experts to discuss further collaboration and ways to empower deeper research of these critical issues. We will continue to facilitate these forums in 2021.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe believe we have a responsibility to protect the integrity of the public conversation and hold state power to account.

Recent conversation around our photo cropping methods brought this to the forefront, and over the past week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been reviewing the way we test for bias in our systems and discussing ways we can improve how we display images on Twitter. So, while there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot still to do, today we want to share how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re developing a solution for each of these areas.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow We Tested Our System\nWe tested the existing machine learning (ML) system that decides how to crop images before bringing it to Twitter, but we should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve published how we did it at the same time so the analysis could be externally reproducible. This was an oversight.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThe image cropping system relies on saliency, which predicts where people might look first. For our initial bias analysis, we tested pairwise preference between two demographic groups (White-Black, White-Indian, White-Asian and male-female). In each trial, we combined two faces into the same image, with their order randomized, then computed the saliency map over the combined image. Then, we located the maximum of the saliency map, and recorded which demographic category it landed on. We repeated this 200 times for each pair of demographic categories and evaluated the frequency of preferring one over the other.\nWhile our analyses to date haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shown racial or gender bias, we recognize that the way we automatically crop photos means there is a potential for harm. We should\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done a better job of anticipating this possibility when we were first designing and building this product. We are currently conducting additional analysis to add further rigor to our testing, are committed to sharing our findings, and are exploring ways to open-source our analysis so that others can help keep us accountable.\nChanges to Come\nWe are prioritizing work to decrease our reliance on ML-based image cropping by giving people more visibility and control over what their images will look like in a Tweet. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started exploring different options to see what will work best across the wide range of images people Tweet every day. We hope that giving people more choices for image cropping and previewing what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll look like in the Tweet composer may help reduce the risk of harm.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nGoing forward, we are committed to following the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat you see is what you get\u00e2\u0080\u009d principles of design, meaning quite simply: the photo you see in the Tweet composer is what it will look like in the Tweet. There may be some exceptions to this, such as photos that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a standard size or are really long or wide. In those cases, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to experiment with how we present the photo in a way that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t lose the creator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intended focal point or take away from the integrity of the photo.\u00c2\u00a0\nBias in ML systems is an industry-wide issue, and one we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to improving on Twitter.

This quarter, we take a closer look at the impact of #BlackLivesMatter for Tweeps in the US and around the world.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nJust when 2020 had done the most \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it did more. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long overdue summer of racial reckoning in the United States and around the world, as advocates and allies raise their voices and demand an end to systemic racism, white supremacy, police brutality, and anti-Blackness.\u00c2\u00a0\n#BlackLivesMatter is a movement that transcends political parties or nation-states; it's grounded in a struggle for fundamental human rights\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the hashtag first appeared in 2013 right on Twitter. So not only does that mean it hits especially close to home for all of us at Twitter, but also, as a Black woman raising three Black children, this work is deeply personal.\nThe road to racial equality is long, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of the steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken to lay the foundation for us to continue to drive progress. While this blog post is mostly focused on the urgent call for change within the Black community in the US, we know that this echoes throughout our work with underrepresented groups around the world.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with representation within our US workforce*:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve set an ambitious goal for 2025 of having at least 25% of our overall US workforce be underrepresented minorities\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least 10% of which will be Black Tweeps. These numbers aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly big enough, especially in technical and leadership roles, but they do show that Twitter strives to be a leader of our industry when it comes to representation of Black employees. Check out our latest workforce representation data in our Inclusion & Diversity Report.\nSo once Tweeps walk through our (now virtual) doors, what do we do to make sure they #LoveWhereYouWork?\u00c2\u00a0 Short answer: A lot\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFirst, we want every Tweep regardless of location or job to understand their role in creating a culture where everyone is empowered to bring their full authentic selves to work, experience belonging, and do the best work of their career. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the first messages we deliver to all new Tweeps on Day One in #FlightSchool, our new hire orientation. This vision takes ongoing work, so we also empower Tweeps with courses like \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealthy Conversations\u00e2\u0080\u009d (how to respectfully navigate tough topics in the workplace), \u00e2\u0080\u009cWords Matter\u00e2\u0080\u009d (how to spot and interrupt microaggressions), and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAllyship @ Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u009d (how to be an ally to underrepresented people). We recently made these courses mandatory for all Tweeps around the world to ensure everyone is operating with the same understanding of what is expected from them.\nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs) are the lifeblood of inclusion efforts at Twitter and Blackbirds is one of our oldest, largest, and most well known. Founded in 2012, Blackbirds membership spans across our global offices. In the past year alone, membership has grown by more than 100% \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a testament to the strength of our Blackbirds community and their allies. I want to take a moment to personally acknowledge the global leadership team of Blackbirds whose passionate commitment to this work makes us all better. Thank you, Keyaira Lock, Jade Williams, Marvin Williams, Sioban Massiah, Ola Idowu, Sheldon Louis, and Royce Haynes.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThese Tweeps \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0and all our BRG chairs around the world\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 empower our next generation of leaders, foster a culture of inclusivity and belonging, and give back to the greater community. In addition to performing their core job function, they navigate the complexities, nuances, and emotional labor of sometimes being the only person who looks, loves, worships, or has lived like them. They do this work to empower our next generation of leaders, so that one day, they will no longer be the only. This work is essential to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is not a \u00e2\u0080\u009cside hustle\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cvolunteer activity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we recently introduced a new compensation program to formally recognize the global leadership team of all of our BRGs.\u00c2\u00a0\nDespite longstanding ongoing investments in this work, like many of you, this summer we were called to do even more.\u00c2\u00a0\nFirst, we hosted a series of #FlockTalks on racial justice and anti-Blackness in the US, EMEA, and JAPAC. #FlockTalks are Tweep-only sessions, designed to hold space for those who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to come together in community to share how they're feeling with one another. We believe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a direct correlation between conversations like this, the health of our workplace, and the health of our service.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe #FlockTalks revealed that many of our Tweeps were struggling with emotions highly associated with trauma \u00e2\u0080\u0094 anger, anxiety, sadness, depression, and numbness. So we created #TakeCare, a one-hour, virtual discussion featuring therapists and wellness experts specializing in racism and trauma, providing tools and guidance to help Tweeps unpack and process everything happening in the world. We also expanded our mental health benefits to increase ongoing access to Black therapists with expertise in anti-Blackness, systemic racism, and race-related trauma.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nRacism impacts communities around the world. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why nearly all of our global BRGs delivered programs that empowered Tweeps to reflect on, and take a deeper look at anti-Blackness across their respective communities:\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Alas hosted a four-part workshop series dismantling anti-Blackness within the Latinx community, featuring a wide array of global speakers across the Latinx diaspora, including Rosa Clemente (@rosaClemente), Zahira Kelly-Cabrera (@bad_dominicana), and Luana Genot (@luanagenot).\nMonique Melton (@MoeMotivate) joined Twitter Parents to discuss raising antiracist kids\nTwitter Open kicked off global Pride Month by unpacking the intersectionality of the Black and Queer communities with DeRay Mckesson (@deray).\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter Stripes hosted a powerful conversation about #BlackLivesMatter and combating racial bias in the military, which featured veteran Tweeps as well as external speakers, Richard Brookshire, co-founder of the Black Veterans Project (@BlackVetProject), and Tonya Oxendine of Merging Vets and Players (@VetsandPlayers).\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter Faith co-hosted a #PraiseBreak with Blackbirds for a moment of reflection, gratitude, and faith, with special guest DJ Diamond Kuts (@djdiamondkuts).\nTwitter Women facilitated a hands-on workshop called #CallYourGirlfriend on the historical context and understanding privilege and oppression with Melanie Brazzell of What Really Makes Us Safe (@WhatMakesUsSafe).\nTwitter Able hosted a global all-hands discussing allyship and solidarity with the black community.\u00c2\u00a0\nAnd Twitter Asians is planning an Anti-Racism series with the goal of providing participants with the knowledge and tools to become active in dismantling racism and prejudice in the Asian community.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAll summer, we demonstrated our solidarity and allyship on @TwitterTogether, and across other Twitter owned and operated accounts. We proudly joined the push for\u00c2\u00a0#PoliceReformNow, #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor, and our leadership and policy teams have been meeting with advocates and elected officials to help drive progress. We made sure Black mental health resources were front and center for anyone who needed them in this curated Moment. We published \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow to be an ally right now: #BlackLivesMatter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shared it with the world in a thread and blog, and helped everyone Diversify Your Feed.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nLast week, the verdict in Breonna Taylor's case once again showed us how much work we have to do. The system isn't broken, it's functioning exactly as it was intended to. And for those wanting to practice allyship, wanting to dismantle systems of oppression and change the status quo, we launched a new series of workshops for Tweeps with new content to reflect current events based on our four principles of allyship: Learn, Ask, Show Up, and Speak Up.\u00c2\u00a0Learn about approach in the Twitter Blog, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAllyship Right Now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe also launched #TwitterTogetherTalks, a new series exploring racial equity, inclusion, and diversity. We started with best-selling author and scholar Dr. Ibram X. Kendi (@DrIbram) for a conversation with Tweeps about dismantling systemic racism and how to be an antiracist. Next up was award-winning writer, director, and advocate Janet Mock (@janetmock) to explore the intersectionality of movements and the importance of #BlackTransLivesMatter. Most recently, we hosted Anthony Ray Hinton (@eji_org) in conversation with @jack to explore racial injustice and brutality in policing and the impact of mass incarceration on Black communities.\nA common theme we heard was that between the pandemic and a summer of racial reckoning, Tweeps were tired. So we introduced a day of global rest for the company. It was so popular, we introduced four more. We also led our industry by announcing that Juneteenth would be a US holiday forevermore. For Tweeps outside the US, we identified regional emancipation dates to ensure everyone can observe this important day of reflection.\nOn Juneteenth, we elevated Black voices and their Tweets to educate and celebrate Black joy. Across the nation, our Community and Culture team demanded racial equity and justice with powerful statements, reflected on billboards throughout cities at the center of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Our Social team partnered with Blackbirds to dedicate an entire day to a never-ending parade of creativity and a true love for life with #BlackJoy. We also commemorated with a @Twitter Voice Tweet from Opal Tometi (co-founder of #BlackLivesMatter), published a @TwitterTogether thread educating on what Juneteenth represents, and commissioned Black artists to update headers of Twitter owned and operated accounts.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe also deepened our investments in the advocacy organizations on the front lines driving change, and empowered Tweeps to do the same by lifting our matching gifts cap. We made a $250,000 grant split evenly between the Equal Justice Initiative (@eji_org) and the National Association of Black Journalists (@NABJ). We dedicated #AdsForGood grants for nonprofit organizations to amplify #BlackLivesMatter voices on Twitter. As we did with COVID-19, we are offering free premium ad services for credible resources and voices from the movement on Twitter, such as the Spotlight and Promoted sections in the Trends/Explore tab and First View on the Home timeline for all users to see, just for example. In 2021, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing a more globally inclusive approach to our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOne of the most powerful things we can do is promote healthy conversation on our service. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to iterate on our policies and roll out new product features to do this. This is a part of ongoing work to expand our hateful conduct policy that started in 2018. As a part of this work, we quickly realized we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all the answers, which is why we have developed a global working group of outside experts to help us think about how we should address dehumanizing speech around more complex categories like race, ethnicity, and national origin. This group will help us understand the nuances, important regional and historical context, and ultimately help us answer questions like how we address power and privilege on the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nMost importantly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to serve the public conversation and fight for racial justice and inclusion\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop #UntilWeAllBelong.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@TwitterTogether\n#UntilWeAllBelong\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndiversity\n#UntilWeAllBelong\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          \nInclusion & Diversity Report May 2020: Principles during a pandemic\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 27 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}
{"date": "Thursday, 24 September 2020", "title": "Our continued work to keep Twitter secure ", "topic": "Company", "author": "Parag Agrawal", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-continued-work-to-keep-twitter-secure", "post_text": "Company\nOur continued work to keep Twitter secure \n            By\n            \n  \n  \n          \n            and\n            \n  \n  \nThursday, 24 September 2020\nLink copied successfully\nAt Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re acutely aware of the role we play in society and we take that responsibility seriously. We have been, and will continue to be, focused on empowering the public conversation. To do this, we must protect the security and privacy of the people who use our service. You can see some of this work on Twitter, such as in the privacy and account security settings and controls we offer you, but a lot of it happens behind the scenes. We want to share more on the work we're doing to protect your account and keep Twitter secure.\n1. Improving our access management processes and authentication systems.\nAs we shared in July, we have teams around the world that need to access customer data to provide account services and keep Twitter running. For example, engineering team members have access to build and operate the features that people rely on every day. Other teams use proprietary tools to help with a variety of support issues including to review content for potential violations of the Twitter Rules and respond to user reports. We are constantly working to balance how we build products and provide support to people who use Twitter while ensuring the security and privacy of people who use our service. That means access is limited and is only granted for valid business reasons (i.e., ensuring an account holder can get support if they are locked out of their account).\nTo further secure our internal tools from potential misuse, we have been strengthening the rigorous checks that team members with access must undergo. This also helps reduce the potential for an unauthorized person to get access to our systems. We have strict principles around who is allowed access to which tools and at what time, and require specific justifications for customer data to be accessed.\n2. Improving our detection and monitoring capabilities.\nSimilar to how we proactively detect and alert you of suspicious behavior on your account to help you keep it secure, we have internal detection and monitoring tools that help alert us of unusual behavior or possible unauthorized attempts to access our internal tools. These tools are constantly being improved, even since the July incident, to include things like expanding our detection and response efforts to include suspicious authentication and access activity.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition to the improvements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made on the backend, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to have meaningful controls over your account security and privacy on Twitter. We recently implemented some of these security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the US, and we encourage everyone on Twitter to enable security controls such as two-factor authentication and password reset protection.\n3. Investing in tools and training for our employees and contractors.\nIn addition to requiring Security and Privacy & Data Protection training for all newly hired Twitter employees, we introduced new courses and increased the frequency and availability of existing courses for all employees. For example, we introduced two new mandatory training sessions for people who have access to non-public information. These trainings make clear the dos and don'ts when accessing this information and ensure employees understand how to protect themselves when they are online so they can better avoid becoming phishing targets for attackers. In addition to existing security training courses, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also enhanced training content on secure coding, threat modeling, privacy impact assessments, and privacy by design so privacy is integrated into everything we design and build by default.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur teams have also been investing in additional penetration testing and scenario planning to help secure Twitter from a range of possible threats, including in the context of the upcoming 2020 US elections. Specifically, over a five month period from March 1 to August 1, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cross-functional elections team conducted tabletop exercises internally on specific election scenarios. Some of the topics included: hacks and other security incidents, leaks of hacked materials, platform manipulation activity, foreign interference, coordinated online voter suppression campaigns, and the post election day period.\nInternally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out phishing-resistant security keys and requiring our team to use them when authenticating to systems around the world. This is work we had already begun but have accelerated in recent weeks. This will help reduce the risk of an unauthorized third-party gaining access to our internal systems using compromised employee credentials.\u00c2\u00a0\nFinally, we continue to invest in and scale the processes in place to review products for security and privacy concerns before they launch. If a project could have significant privacy impacts, we conduct a detailed impact assessment to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking appropriate measures before we launch it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve significantly increased the number of privacy reviews and impact assessments the past few years. Specifically, in 2018, we did about 100 privacy reviews; in 2019, we did almost 500 privacy reviews; and in the first 6 months of 2020, we have completed more than 300 privacy reviews. \nSo what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? \nWe are continuing to invest more in the teams, technology, and resources to support this critical work. We also know that we can do more to make it easier for you to find and use the settings and controls we offer, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on rolling out improvements to the design and navigation of our privacy settings. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see these improvements in Twitter soon.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe want you to have peace of mind when you come to Twitter that the data you share with us is secure, and that you understand and feel empowered to use the controls we offer you to keep your account secure. This will always be ongoing work for us, but trust that we are committed to acting in the interest of the people who use our service. Where we discover an issue, we will work quickly to fix it, learn from it, and hold ourselves accountable by keeping you informed.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nprivacy\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

We collaborated on #YouthDay through an on-service conversation with @UNYouthEnvoy, this activation highlighted the challenges faced by youth of today, as we navigate the global COVID-19 pandemic.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn the spirit of marking the two year anniversary of the UN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Youth 2030 Strategy, we also worked together on the first ever Twitter emoji designed by young people, for young people, across the globe.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThrough a series of engaging Twitter polls and threads from @UNYouthEnvoy, young people had their voices heard on the creation of an emoji that would represent them and the work they do; from deciding on the hashtag #YouthLead, to determining what design elements the emoji should include, to voting on the final emoji design.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThis emoji and hashtag aims to unify and drive an inclusive conversation on Twitter about the work young people are leading on in our local and global communities.\u00c2\u00a0 To support this diverse and inclusive dialogue, the\u00c2\u00a0#YouthLead\u00c2\u00a0hashtag,\u00c2\u00a0is available in 20 different languages including Spanish, Korean and Thai.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nToday, on the two year anniversary of the Youth 2030 Strategy, we are happy to launch the chosen emoji, activated on Twitter through the hashtag #YouthLead. Through this emoji, we are inviting young people from all around the world to share their perspectives on what youth leadership looks like to them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 highlighting the many innovations, challenges and successes that youth continue to experience everyday.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nJayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Secretary-General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Envoy on Youth, notes; ''Young people are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from its immediate challenges like disruption to education, loss of employment, increased mental health challenges, and increased gender-based violence both online and offline, to its long-term socio economic impacts, young people have undoubtedly been hit the hardest. But they rose up to the challenge. As they always are during times of crisis, young people were resilient and resourceful, and they stepped up to protect and support their communities regardless of the challenges they were facing.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are pleased to collaborate with Twitter to celebrate the resiliency and leadership that young people show every day on the streets, in the classrooms and in the frontlines by creating the #YouthLead emoji by young people, for young people to celebrate their contributions to build a more sustainable and peaceful word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThese ideas for the #YouthLead emoji were brought to life through the artwork of young artist\u00c2\u00a0Seqininnguaq Qitura Poulsen. Seqininnguaq is an emerging young Inuk/Kalaaleq leader from Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) where she works on indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights as well as education and mental health. Seqininnguaq is also part of the Global Indigenous Youth Caucus where she is leading as their Arctic Focal Point.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhen Seqininnguaq was bringing young peoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ideas to life with the emoji, it was important for her to highlight that young people can and should be empowered to have a powerful voice in important decisions being made, around the world.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nTo mark the launch, Seqininnguaq had a special message to young people around the world:\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re struggling and no matter how much you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re struggling and what it is you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re struggling with, there is always support and help. You will find your people, you will find a place where you feel safe, accepted and loved, I promise'' \nCelebrating the power of youth is something that we continue to prioritise at Twitter. Throughout the year, we have partnered with youth organisations across the globe to support them, as they make use of Twitter to engage in conversations leading to change.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur partnerships with organisations like the Office of the Secretary General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Envoy on Youth, are key for us to stay engaged and educated on the needs and wants of the youth of today - we appreciate these collaborations and look forward to what partnerships like this can create in the future.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo see how young voices are empowered on Twitter follow\u00c2\u00a0@TwitterForGood\u00c2\u00a0and join the conversation -\u00c2\u00a0#YouthLead.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n** Source: Twitter/Ipsos US national study, Sept. 2020; Young people = 18-34 year olds in the US; Young Twitter users refers to those 18-34 who report using Twitter at least once a month in the US.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npartnerships\nsocialmediadata\nsociety & culture\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nThe Twitter NeighborNest turns four\n            \n            \n             Friday, 7 June 2019\n          \n#TwitterForGood Day around the world\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 December 2016\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

As we grapple with the weight and reality of an unprecedented public health crisis, it is our job to ensure that Twitter remains a safe space for anyone interested in mental health tips and resources or opening up about their individual mental health concerns. \nSuicide prevention in extraordinary times \nAccording to the World Health Organization, almost 800,000 people die due to suicide every year. Further, suicide rates can increase in prolonged crises and experts note that the COVID-19 global pandemic will cause distress and leave many people vulnerable to mental health problems and suicidal behavior. The US Center for Disease Control reports that younger adults, racial/ethnic minorities and essential workers are disproportionately faced with these mental health challenges.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese statistics emphasize the urgency and importance of elevating the global conversation on suicide prevention and self harm, and we recognize that we have a role and responsibility to help improve access to and raise awareness of suicide prevention and self harm information and services.\u00c2\u00a0\nRaising awareness and elevating the public conversation\nEarlier this summer, we worked with various mental health partners across the globe to raise awareness and encourage honest conversation around the emotional challenges we are experiencing together, amid the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. Since then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve expanded our work with NGOs to identify, connect, and engage vulnerable people across the world. In particular, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continued to engage suicide prevention organizations and counseling services to ensure that people on Twitter feel safe and have access to support when they need it most.\nWorld Suicide Prevention Day\u00c2\u00a0\nWorld Suicide Prevention Day on September 10, 2020 welcomes another opportunity to continue our momentum in spreading awareness and encouraging action to prevent suicide and self harm.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter is grateful to continue our global World Suicide Prevention Day partnership with the International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP). Together, for the third year, we are launching a custom emoji in the shape of an orange ribbon - the international symbol for World Suicide Prevention Day. The emoji will appear when people Tweet with the hashtags #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, #WSPD, #WSPD2020 and #SuicidePrevention through September 25 and is activated in 23 languages.\nWe are working with over 20 nonprofit partners worldwide to offer Ads for Good grants and amplify their local campaigns on Twitter. These partners are leading suicide prevention and mental health awareness in markets across the Asia Pacific, US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, and Africa.\nWe are also amplifying the creative activations of our Trust & Safety Council Suicide Prevention & Mental Health advisory group partners around World Suicide Prevention Day across the globe, including:\n#ICANHELP: Using Twitter to amplify ideas from student leaders on tackling suicide in local communities across the US.\n#MentalHealthPH: Starting a hashtag campaign, #MayKaramayKa, to encourage people in the Philippines to thank those who helped them in times of need. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also hosting a Q&A on September 10th for mental health professionals and psychologists to answer questions in real-time.\nMentally Aware Nigeria: Launching an animated video series covering a range of topics from identifying suicidal behaviors to supporting those in need.\u00c2\u00a0\nTELL: Launching #StepUp, a virtual step challenge encouraging everyone to take one step for each life lost daily from suicide in Japan - between WSPD and World Mental Health Day.\u00c2\u00a0\nBeyond Blue: Showcasing stories of 8 individuals who experienced suicidal ideation in Australia, empowering individuals in crisis to know that support is available.\u00c2\u00a0\n#ThereIsHelp\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve partnered with local mental health authorities and nonprofits in each market to offer #ThereIsHelp - a notification service that provides valuable mental health information and resources via Twitter and email. \nWhen someone searches for terms associated with suicide or self harm, the top search result is a notification encouraging them to reach out for help. This year we expanded the prompts to several new markets in consultation with local mental health partners to ensure that we are sharing the latest and most helpful resources in our #ThereisHelp prompts across the globe.\n#ThereIsHelp is available for people in the US, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the UK.\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active commitment to improving mental health plays an important role in addressing suicide and self harm, and we look forward to continued collaboration with suicide prevention organizations across the world.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ncommunity outreach\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \n#TwitterForGood Day around the world\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 December 2016\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

This includes everything from accessibility in our office spaces to our marketing and communications strategies, to legal and policy standards, and more.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThe Experience Accessibility Team will work within our product org on new and existing features and products, providing resources and tools that promote greater accessibility on the service.

The format was a 'shotgun scramble' golf tournament in Los Angeles, CA meant to celebrate a few of\u00c2\u00a0Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Data partners\u00c2\u00a0and their customers for a day of fun on the links. If you are unfamiliar with the scramble format, each member of a four-person team tees off and the team repeatedly picks the best shot until the hole is completed. With a 'shotgun' start, there are 18 teams that begin play simultaneously \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each starting on a different hole. For example, team 8 starts on hole 8.\nWith most non-professional golf tournaments, the team scores are typically not known until the very end when the scorecards are turned in. How cool would it be to get real-time score updates during the game? We saw this as an opportunity to create a tool that would allow for a live scoring system. This system could enable teams to submit their scores from the course as holes are completed, and the compiled scores could be shared via a live leaderboard, helping to fuel the competition.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs members of the Twitter Developer Relations team, we felt up for the challenge to build such a scoring system with the Twitter platform. We began prototyping a solution during a company hackweek. We first sketched out a technical design for a system where: \nTeam scores are submitted via Direct Messages.\nWhen a score arrives, the score is stored, a new leaderboard is generated, and that leaderboard is immediately sent back to the scorer via a Direct Message.\nWhen a score arrives that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s under par, a congratulatory Tweet is posted.\nEvent \"marshals\" are enabled to post leaderboard Tweets as the event unfolded.\nIt became clear that we'd be building a\u00c2\u00a0Twitter chatbot,\u00c2\u00a0where private messages (Direct Messages) provide the main communication channel, while also having the ability to communicate with public Tweets.\nDesign and Twitter building blocks\nWhen we thought about the features we'd want for such an app, these surfaced as the main features:\nScores are submitted via Direct Messages using a simple format that encodes the team number, the number of the hole just completed, along with the score. Each team has a score keeper, and this player is taught how to submit scores.\nWhen a player submits a score, they should receive an updated leaderboard via Direct Message. This serves as confirmation that the score was received and accepted.\nThe system needed the ability to support updating an incorrect score. Mistakes will happen.\nIf the score is below par, a Tweet is automatically posted to publicly congratulate the team. #BirdieAlert\nThe app should support a set of admin-level commands that only event marshals have access to. For example, these marshals decide when to publicly Tweet the leaderboard, typically every 20-30 minutes. We did not want to Tweet a leaderboard every time a score is submitted since a total of 324 scores are expected.\nThe leaderboard should look good and be easy to understand. Building a leaderboard graphic took considerably more effort than expected. See below for the final output.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWith these design goals in mind, we began to build with the following Twitter API endpoints, which provide the foundation for any Twitter chatbot: \u00c2\u00a0\nAccount Activity API\u00c2\u00a0- We knew we were building a 'listening' application, and we needed to listen for incoming Direct Messages with scores. The webhook-based Account Activity API (AAA) provides these real-time listening skills. The AAA provides the bridge between your web app and Twitter. We created the @HackerScorer account to host the chatbot and subscribed that account to the AAA service.\nDirect Message API\u00c2\u00a0- When a score was received, the chatbot was designed to immediately respond to the scorer with an updated leaderboard in a Direct Messages. So, we knew the Direct Messages API would provide the fundamental 'submit score' communication channel.\nPOST statuses/update\u00c2\u00a0- The\u00c2\u00a0@HackerScorer\u00c2\u00a0account needed to Tweet when the event marshals triggered a leaderboard update. The system was also designed to send a congratulatory Tweet automatically when a score arrived that was under par.\nLearnings and next steps\nEven though we were testing and debugging up until the night before the event (like any hackweek project), we are happy to report the leaderboard app worked nearly flawlessly. The ability to see how other teams were scoring added to the excitement as the event progressed. Seeing notifications of other team's subpar holes added to the \"what's happening now?\" experience.\nThe main day-of-show challenge was spotty cell coverage out on the course. It's definitely recommended to test coverage at the event location beforehand. Also, in some cases, there clearly was not enough training on how to submit scores correctly the first time (we will not name names). Finally, we built the app to Tweet only when teams scored a Birdie (one under par). While Eagles (two under par) were not expected, they happened several times and were not Tweeted about. More sadly, there was a hole-in-one that went completely unacknowledged in real-time. Next time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sure to account for these rare events and notify the audience!\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNot into golf? That's OK. Keep in mind that the framework used here to support a live golf scoring system is general enough for other use cases. This design could be used for a variety of other scenarios like scavenger hunts and other sports tournaments, such as soccer and bowling.

But too often, we look at one word or phrase trending on Twitter and ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy is this trending?\u00e2\u0080\u009d That question was actually Tweeted over half a million times over the last year! It should be easier to understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being said immediately. Throughout Twitter, we've been working to bring people more context on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with labels on Tweets and accounts as well as curated pages (aka Moments) and related articles on trends. To help with this, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding pinned Tweets and descriptions on trends to help explain why something is trending.\u00c2\u00a0\nSometimes the right Tweet can help make sense of a trend. Starting today, some trends will have a representative Tweet pinned to them to give you more insight about a trend right away. A combination of algorithms and our curation team determine if a Tweet represents a trend by evaluating if the Tweet is very reflective of the trend and popular. Our algorithms are designed to identify representative Tweets that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t potentially abusive, spam, or posted by accounts trying to take advantage of our system. Representative Tweets on trends can be found on Twitter for iOS and Android now. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to bring them to twitter.com soon too.\nIn the coming weeks, you should see brief descriptions added to some trends as well to help add context to the trend. Descriptions will provide straightforward, clearly sourced context around why something is trending. Descriptions are developed by our curation team and follow their guidelines. Descriptions on trends will be found on twitter.com and Twitter for iOS and Android.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nRepresentative Tweets and descriptions on trends will be available in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Egypt, France, India, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. To bring more clarity to the conversation, we hope to add more context to more trends over time.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo be clear, we know there is more work to do to improve trends and the context updates we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re announcing today are just a small step in the right direction. There is more we can do to help people understand why something is trending and to provide transparency around how something trends.

We believe that transparency is a key principle in our mission to protect the Open Internet, and advancing the Internet as a global force for good.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe fundamental belief in the power of open, public conversation inspired Twitter to launch one of the industry's first transparency reports back in 2012. At that time, our goal was to provide the public with regular insights into government pressure that impacted the public, whether through overt attempts at political censorship or by way of soliciting account data through information requests.\nThe world has changed significantly since 2012. In 2020, it is more important than ever that we shine a light on our own practices, including how we enforce the Twitter Rules, our ongoing work to disrupt global state-backed information operations, and the increased attempts by governments to request information about account holders. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur new Twitter Transparency Center\nWe have reimagined and rebuilt our biannual Twitter Transparency Report site to become a comprehensive Twitter Transparency Center.

We will continue to work on increasing awareness and understanding about how our policies work and our practices around content moderation, data disclosures and other critical areas. In addition, we will take every opportunity to highlight the actions of law enforcement, governments, and other organizations that impact Twitter and the people who use our service across the world.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe data\nThe latest data reflects the period July 1 to December 31, 2019. We endeavour to release this material as soon as possible every six months but due to a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic and getting the new Twitter Transparency Center up and running, we have faced delays. The next update to the data will cover the period of January - June 2020.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur work on information operations:\nOur archive of state-backed information operations is updated on a rolling basis after we identify and remove them from Twitter. We have also increased our cadence of disclosures, recently sharing our largest disclosure to date with 32,242 accounts added to the archive.\nThis archive, used by researchers, journalists and experts around the world, now spans more than 9 terabytes of media, includes over 83,000 accounts, and over 200 million Tweets and is an industry-first resource. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve now released datasets of information operations originating in more than 15 countries, offering researchers unique insight into how information operations unfold on the service.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also expanding how we work with partners in the research community to improve understanding of information operations and disinformation. Earlier this year we strengthened our partnership with two leading research institutions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and the Stanford Internet Observatory \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to enable their analysis and review of data related to our disclosures.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe also hosted our first ever #InfoOps2020 conference in partnership with Carnegie's Partnership for Countering Influence Operations. The event brought together academic experts, industry, and government to discuss opportunities for collaboration and research on IO and support an open exchange of ideas between Twitter and the research community.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPlatform Manipulation:\nOur blog from earlier this year gives a thorough explanation about our proactive work to counter platform manipulation across the service and the common misconceptions around so-called \u00e2\u0080\u0098bots\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on Twitter. Our policies in this area focus on behaviour, not content, and are written in a way that targets the spammy tactics different people or groups could use to try to manipulate the public conversation on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nContinuing a year-on-year trend, our proactive detection of this behavior has resulted in an almost 10% reduction in anti-spam challenges, e.g. when we ask people to provide a phone number or email address or fill in a ReCAPTCHA code to verify there is a human behind an account.\u00c2\u00a0\nTerrorism & violent extremism:\nThe Twitter Rules prohibit the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism. Action was taken on 86,799 unique accounts under this policy during this reporting period. 74% of the unique accounts were proactively suspended using our internal, proprietary tools. We continue our close partnership with our peers as part of the Christchurch Call to Action and are committed to eradicating the presence of violent extremist content across our respective services.\u00c2\u00a0\nChild sexual exploitation:\nWe do not tolerate child sexual exploitation on Twitter. Child sexual exploitation (CSE) including links to images of or content promoting child exploitation, is removed from the site without further notice and reported to The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC). People can report content that appears to violate the Twitter Rules regarding Child Sexual Exploitation via our web form and we also investigate other reports via various reporting flows in-app for CSE too. There were 257,768 unique accounts suspended during this reporting period for violating Twitter policies prohibiting child sexual exploitation. 84% of those unique accounts were proactively suspended using a combination of technologies (including PhotoDNA and internal, proprietary tools).\nTwitter Rules enforcement:\nFor the first time, we are expanding the scope of this section to better align with the Twitter Rules, and sharing more granular data on violated policies. This is in line with best practices under the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation.\u00c2\u00a0\nDue to our increased focus on proactively surfacing violative content for human review, more granular policies, better reporting tools, and also the introduction of more data across twelve distinct policy areas, we have seen a 47% increase in accounts locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules. This work will never be stagnant and these stats should fluctuate as we improve and the challenge evolves. The increase is also reflective of a trend we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed across our recent Twitter Transparency Reports, as we step up the level of proactive enforcement across the service and invest in technological solutions to respond to the changing characteristics of bad-faith activity on our service.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAbuse/harassment As we tightened our rules and increased our use of technology and human review working in concern, there was a 95% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our abuse policy during this reporting period. This reporting period saw the largest increase in the number of accounts actioned under these policies.\nHateful conduct Hateful conduct expanded to include a new dehumanization policy on July 9, 2019. There was a 54% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our hateful conduct policy during this reporting period.\nSensitive media, including graphic violence and adult content There was a 39% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our sensitive media policy during this reporting period.\nPromoting suicide & self-harm We do not permit people to promote, advocate, and persuade another individual to engage in self-harm or suicide. There was a 29% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations for this type of behavior. This is the first time we disclosed this data as we reprioritized how this type of egregious content can be reported to Twitter expeditiously.\nIllegal or certain regulated goods or services A new addition to our data disclosures, there were 60,807 unique accounts actioned for violations of our illegal or certain regulated goods or services policy during this reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nPrivate information Sharing an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s private information \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or so-called doxxing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without their express consent is a violation of the Twitter Rules. Internal tooling improvements allowed us to increase enforcement of this policy, and there was a 41% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our private information policy during this reporting period.\nNon-consensual nudity Due to internal improvements and extensive retraining specific to this enforcement area, this reporting period saw a 109% increase in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our non-consensual nudity policy, the largest increase in the number of accounts actioned under this policy.\nViolent threats During this reporting period, we saw a 5% decrease in the number of accounts actioned for violations of our violence policies (Violent Threats and Glorification of Violence).\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLegal requests:\nIn addition to enforcing the Twitter Rules, we also may take action in response to legal requests.\nInformation requests (legal requests for account information):\u00c2\u00a0\nGovernments and law enforcement agencies around the world submitted approximately 21% more information requests compared to the previous reporting period. Notably, the aggregate number of accounts specified in these requests increased by nearly 63%. The total volume of requests and specified accounts are respectively the largest we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen to date since our transparency reporting began in 2012. We received government information requests from 91 different countries since 2012.\nInformation requests from the United States continue to make up the highest percentage of legal requests for account information. During this reporting period, 26% of all global requests for account information originated within the United States. The second highest volume of requests originate from Japan, comprising 22% of global information requests.\nAnonymous and pseudonymous speech is important to Twitter and is central to our commitment to defend and protect the voices of the public. We often receive non-government information requests to disclose account information of anonymous or pseudonymous Twitter accounts (i.e., requests to \u00e2\u0080\u009cunmask\u00e2\u0080\u009d the identity of the individual), which we frequently object to. Twitter objected to 23 US civil requests for account information that sought to unmask the identities of anonymous speakers on first amendment grounds during this reporting period. We ended up litigating six of these requests. Twitter prevailed in four cases, lost one, and one is still pending. No information was produced in response to the other 17 requests.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nRemoval requests (legal requests for content removal)*:\nIn this reporting period, Twitter received 27,538 legal demands to remove content specifying 98,595 accounts. This is the largest number of requests and specified accounts that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received since releasing our first Transparency Report in 2012.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis record number of legal demands originated from 51 different countries. 86% of the total global volume of legal demands originated from only three countries: Japan, Russia, and Turkey.\u00c2\u00a0\nLegal demands from Japan increased by 143% this reporting period, accounting for 45% of global requests received. The 12,496 requests from Japan are primarily related to laws regarding narcotics and psychotropics, obscenity, or money lending.\nCopyright & trademark actions:\u00c2\u00a0\nCopyright violations: We received a 13% increase in DMCA takedown notices affecting 163% more accounts during this reporting period.\nTrademark notices: We saw a 7% increase in the total number of trademark notices received since our last report.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis report reflects not only the evolution of the public conversation on our service but the work we do every day to protect and support the people who use Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nFollow @Policy and @TwitterSafety for continued updates on the changes we make across the company to drive meaningful and intuitive transparency.\u00c2\u00a0\n*Unless prohibited from doing so, we continue to publish legal requests when we take action directly to the Lumen Database, a partnership with Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

While the interviews in particular yield valuable insights, they do have some limitations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInterviews are great for informing future initiatives but not particularly helpful for an iterative approach where we have to move fast and get a pulse on the situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fay Cooper, Lead Product Manager at DWP's Children and Families division. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI needed a way to unlock the voice of the customer at scale and shift the conversation with internal stakeholders from, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think and I feel\u00e2\u0080\u009d to \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know because the data shows us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSpecifically, Cooper and her team were looking for evidence to support their hypothesis that many applicants were finding the DWP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telephone-based application process stressful and inconvenient. With the help of\u00c2\u00a0Wordnerds, a UK based software company with pioneering text analysis technology, DWP examined data from the conversation on Twitter to identify the key themes associated with the child support discussion as well as associated emotions and sentiment. The resulting insights confirmed their suspicion about the telephone application\u00c2\u00a0process. Clients were expressing frustration with lack of access outside of DWP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business hours and in some cases, this access limitation even appeared to be exacerbating domestic violence situations. Interestingly, they were also able to capture a better understanding of the male perspective from what has typically been a female-focused process.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThanks to these insights, DWP was able to secure investment for a new digital application service that addressed many of their customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns around ease of access. Within the first three months of the launch, the service moved from 100% telephony to 80% digital, freeing clients from a 45-minute phone application process to just 15 minutes online. And as a result, completion rates are now averaging 95%. This has also allowed DWP to free up resources to focus on other areas of need.\nAnd then COVID\nIn late March amid a global pandemic, the UK government issued a stay at home order beginning what would be three months of lockdown for the country. Agencies and departments across the UK Government were forced to adapt to the new measures while continuing to deliver vital services. For the DWP this drove a critical need to understand how the lockdown was impacting its customers and the crucial payments they rely on to support their children.\nThe DWP again looked to the conversation on Twitter for a real-time pulse of the situation. Unsurprisingly, they found concerns around missed payments due to parents losing jobs, the reassessing of income and general anxiety about increases in child poverty and suffering.\nThe DWP used this information to quickly prioritize service changes, including developing recovery plans to chase missed payments as well as new proactive notifications and faster payment methods. It also inspired the idea of partnering with charities and other volunteer organisations to support single parents in need.\nWhere to next?\nReflecting on the results, Cooper commented, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe real-time nature of Twitter was a game-changer for us. We update our services every two weeks and in order to understand the impact of these new features it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crucial to\u00c2\u00a0get real-time feedback, especially in challenging times such as the lockdown period.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLooking forward, Cooper says they will continue listening to the conversation on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am really passionate about designing services which make a difference. In child maintenance, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerful to see the difference our products make to children and their parents. Our new insight platform, blending traditional user research with Twitter data, will be an important driver towards our objective of delivering a better\u00c2\u00a0user experience while supporting policy change.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nInterested in learning more about the power of social listening?

I talk about legacy mountains in organizations; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a huge obstacle. Legacy structures, processes, and mindsets, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very difficult for a functional leader to overcome those without the C-suite on board. We still have moats and drawbridges with how functions are communicating with each other; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not communicating very well.\nMaureen Blandford\nWhat hinders companies from leveraging the knowledge customer care has?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nToo often people see the contact center as the lowest of the low. When I talk to agents, they know more about what the customers want than the customers do. They have the answers. But organizations don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust their agents to intuitively know what is right for the customer. Yet, 99 percent of the time, they do. They just need to be trusted. Get a big bunch of customer-facing people in a room for three hours and ask them: What do customers do that is really annoying? They will list off everything and give you an amazing, low-cost roadmap of stuff you can fix right away. And it makes your customer-facing teams feel listened to.\nTracey Finlay\nHow do you leverage social insights to make better CX decisions?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOrganizations have focused too much on quantitative social insights (impressions, engagement, reach) which aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t business outcomes, and have underutilized and probably underappreciated the qualitative nature of Twitter data. This is in my opinion more insightful and more powerful as it's feedback that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotive, unprompted, and in the moment. Twitter is now 14 years old and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still surprised by the number of organizations that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any processes or tools like Sprinklr to engage and manage their social engagement and therefore lots of Tweets and DMs go unanswered.

Sometimes people are more comfortable talking about what's happening when they can choose who can reply. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen people use these settings to have conversations that weren't really possible before. Starting today, everyone will be able to use these settings so unwanted replies don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get in the way of meaningful conversations.\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works. Before you Tweet, choose who can reply with three options: 1) everyone (standard Twitter, and the default setting), 2) only people you follow, or 3) only people you mention. Tweets with the latter two settings will be labeled and the reply icon will be grayed out for people who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reply.

And, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any uptick in unwanted Direct Messages.\nPeople who face abuse find these settings helpful \u00e2\u0080\u0093 those who have submitted abuse reports are 3x more likely to use these settings.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a new method to block out noise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 60% of people who used this during the test didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use Mute or Block.\nThe change could lead to more meaningful conversations on Twitter.\nPeople are sharing more of their thoughts \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Tweets using these settings about topics like Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 are on average longer than those that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use these settings.\nSome people use these settings to have more sensitive conversations about politics and social issues. Those with a lot of followers use these settings to share more feelings, opinions, and personal news.\nPeople still can see various points of view.\nResearch shows people understand replies are limited on these Tweets.\nPeople more frequently look for additional commentary when replies are limited \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0 the new Retweets with Comments timeline is visited 4x more often on Tweets using these settings.\nDiffering views can still be shared with Retweets with Comments, which sometimes reach a larger audience than the original Tweet. Several times, we saw more Likes and views on a Retweet with Comment than on the original Tweet, even though the original Tweet author had more followers.\nTwitter serves the public conversation, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for people to be able to see different perspectives. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep working on making it easier for people to find the entire discussion through Retweets with Comments.

This direct line of communication with leaders and officials has helped to democratize political discourse and increase transparency and accountability. We also took steps to protect that discourse because we believe political reach should be earned not bought. In 2019, we banned all state-backed media advertising and political advertising from Twitter. Today we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding the types of political accounts we label.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe will add new labels to the following categories of Twitter accounts:\nAccounts of key government officials, including foreign ministers, institutional entities, ambassadors, official spokespeople, and key diplomatic leaders. At this time, our focus is on senior officials and entities who are the official voice of the state abroad \nAccounts belonging to state-affiliated media entities, their editors-in-chief, and/or their senior staff\u00c2\u00a0 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow do we define government accounts for these new labels?\nOur focus is on senior officials and entities that are the voice of the nation state abroad, specifically the account categories listed above. Labels will only be applied to accounts from the countries represented in the five permanent members of the UN Security Council: China, France, Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For transparency and practicality, we are starting with a limited and clearly-defined group of countries before expanding to a wider range of countries in the future. We believe this is an important step so that when people see an account discussing geopolitical issues from another country, they have context on its national affiliation and are better informed about who they represent. At this time, we're not labeling the personal accounts of heads of state, as these accounts enjoy widespread name recognition, media attention, and public awareness. Institutional accounts associated with their offices that changeover depending on election results will be labeled, however.\u00c2\u00a0 \nIn general, we're focused on those within the respective administrations underneath the head of state that offer its policy perspective abroad. \nHow do we define state-affiliated media accounts for these new labels?\u00c2\u00a0\nState-affiliated media is defined as outlets where the state exercises control over editorial content through financial resources, direct or indirect political pressures, and/or control over production and distribution. Unlike independent media, state-affiliated media frequently use their news coverage as a means to advance a political agenda. We believe that people have the right to know when a media account is affiliated directly or indirectly with a state actor. State-financed media organizations with editorial independence, like the BBC in the UK or NPR in the US for example, will not be labeled. As part of the development of this process, we consulted with a number of expert groups, including members of the Digital and Human Rights Advisory group in Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trust & Safety Council.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe will also no longer amplify state-affiliated media accounts or their Tweets through our recommendation systems including on the home timeline, notifications, and search.

From esports tournaments to digital gaming events and conventions, there is plenty of exciting gaming content to keep up with for the rest of 2020.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just a few weeks away from Gamescom 2020, which will feature Opening Night Live hosted by Geoff Keighley (@GeoffKeighley) and live coverage from IGN (@IGN)\u00c2\u00a0 throughout the rest of the show.

We will provide a more detailed technical report on what occurred at a later date given the ongoing law enforcement investigation and after we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve completed work to further safeguard our service.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat we know now\nThe social engineering that occurred on July 15, 2020, targeted a small number of employees through a phone spear phishing attack. A successful attack required the attackers to obtain access to both our internal network as well as\u00c2\u00a0 specific employee credentials that granted them access to our internal support tools. Not all of the employees that were initially targeted had permissions to use account management tools, but the attackers used their credentials to access our internal systems and gain information about our processes. This knowledge then enabled them to target additional employees who did have access to our account support tools. Using the credentials of employees with access to these tools, the attackers targeted 130 Twitter accounts, ultimately Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of 7.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere has been concern following this incident around our tools and levels of employee access. To run our business, we have teams around the world that help with account support. Our teams use proprietary tools to help with a variety of support issues as well as to review content in line with The Twitter Rules and respond to reports. Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons. We have zero tolerance for misuse of credentials or tools, actively monitor for misuse, regularly audit permissions, and take immediate action if anyone accesses account information without a valid business reason. While these tools, controls, and processes are constantly being updated and improved, we are taking a hard look at how we can make them even more sophisticated.\nThis attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems. This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service. We take that responsibility seriously and everyone at Twitter is committed to keeping your information safe.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve communicated directly with the impacted account owners and worked to restore access to any accounts who may have been temporarily locked out during our remediation efforts. Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working with the appropriate authorities to ensure that the people responsible for this attack are identified.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to protect our service\nSince the attack, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve significantly limited access to our internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while we complete our investigation. As a result, some features (namely, accessing the Your Twitter Data download feature) and processes have been impacted. We will be slower to respond to account support needs, reported Tweets, and applications to our developer platform. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sorry for any delays this causes, but we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a necessary precaution as we make durable changes to our processes and tooling as a result\u00c2\u00a0 of this incident. We will gradually resume our normal response times when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to do so. Thank you for your patience as we work through this.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always investing in increased security protocols, techniques and mechanisms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we work to stay ahead of threats as they evolve. Going forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re accelerating several of our pre-existing security workstreams and improvements to our tools. We are also improving our methods for detecting and preventing inappropriate access to our internal systems and prioritizing security work across many of our teams. We will continue to organize ongoing company-wide phishing exercises throughout the year.\nWe will continue to share updates and precautionary steps we take so that others can learn from this, too. We recognize the trust you place in us, and are committing to earning it by continued open, honest and timely updates anytime an incident like this happens.\u00c2\u00a0\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJuly 18, 2020\nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been informing via the @TwitterSupport account, on Wednesday, July 15, 2020, we detected a security incident at Twitter and took immediate action. As we head into the weekend, we want to provide an overview of where we are.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn this post we summarize the situation as of July 17 at 8:35p Pacific Time. The following information is what we know as of today and may change as our investigation and outside investigations continue. Additionally, as the investigation of this incident is unfolding, there are some details \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly around remediation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that we are not providing right now to protect the security of the effort. We will provide more details, where possible in the future, so that the community and our peers may learn and benefit from what happened.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat happened\u00c2\u00a0\nAt this time, we believe attackers targeted certain Twitter employees through a social engineering scheme. What does this mean? In this context, social engineering is the intentional manipulation of people into performing certain actions and divulging confidential information.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe attackers successfully manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials to access Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal systems, including getting through our two-factor protections. As of now, we know that they accessed tools only available to our internal support teams to target 130 Twitter accounts. For 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets. We are continuing our forensic review of all of the accounts to confirm all actions that may have been taken. In addition, we believe they may have attempted to sell some of the usernames.\nFor up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information through our \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour Twitter Data\u00e2\u0080\u009d tool. This is a tool that is meant to provide an account owner with a summary of their Twitter account details and activity. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true.\u00c2\u00a0None of the eight were verified accounts.\nOur actions\u00c2\u00a0\nWe became aware of the attackers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 action on Wednesday, and moved quickly to lock down and regain control of the compromised accounts. Our incident response team secured and revoked access to internal systems to prevent the attackers from further accessing our systems or the individual accounts. As mentioned above, we are deliberately limiting the detail we share on our remediation steps at this time to protect their effectiveness and will provide more technical details, where possible, in the future.\nIn addition to our efforts behind the scenes, shortly after we became aware of the ongoing situation, we took preemptive measures to restrict functionality for many accounts on Twitter - this included things like preventing them from Tweeting or changing passwords. We did this to prevent the attackers from further spreading their scam as well as to prevent them from being able to take control of any additional accounts while we were investigating. We also locked accounts where a password had been recently changed out of an abundance of caution. Late on Wednesday, we were able to return Tweeting functionality to many accounts, and as of today, have restored most of the accounts that were locked pending password changes for their owners.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are continuing our investigation of this incident, working with law enforcement, and determining longer-term actions we should take to improve the security of our systems. We have multiple teams working around the clock focused on this and on keeping the people who use Twitter safe and informed.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat the attackers accessed\u00c2\u00a0\nThe most important question for people who use Twitter is likely \u00e2\u0080\u0094 did the attackers see any of my private information? For the vast majority of people, we believe the answer is, no. For the 130 accounts that were targeted, here is what we know as of today.\nAttackers were not able to view previous account passwords, as those are not stored in plain text or available through the tools used in the attack. \nAttackers were able to view personal information including email addresses and phone numbers, which are displayed to some users of our internal support tools. \nIn cases where an account was taken over by the attacker, they may have been able to view additional information. Our forensic investigation of these activities is still ongoing. \nWe believe that for up to 36 of the 130 targeted accounts, the attackers accessed the DM inbox, including 1 elected official in the Netherlands. To date, we have no indication that any other former or current elected official had their DMs accessed.\u00c2\u00a0[Added on July 22, 2020] \nWe are actively working on communicating directly with the account-holders that were impacted.\nOur next steps \nAs we head into the weekend and next week, we are focused on these core objectives:\nRestoring access for all account owners who may still be locked out as a result of our remediation efforts. \nContinuing our investigation of the incident and our cooperation with law enforcement.\u00c2\u00a0 \nFurther securing our systems to prevent future attacks. \nRolling out additional company-wide training to guard against social engineering tactics to supplement the training employees receive during onboarding and ongoing phishing exercises throughout the year. \nThrough all of this, we also begin the long work of rebuilding trust with the people who use and depend on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re acutely aware of our responsibilities to the people who use our service and to society more generally. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re embarrassed, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disappointed, and more than anything, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sorry. We know that we must work to regain your trust, and we will support all efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice. We hope that our openness and transparency throughout this process, and the steps and work we will take to safeguard against other attacks in the future, will be the start of making this right.\nMore to come via @TwitterSupport as our investigation continues.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsecurity\nprivacy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

When it comes to wildfires, early detection can buy authorities time to warn impacted communities and get the right resources in the right place quickly. Up until now, first responders and disaster response coordinators have lacked easy access to real-time, on-the-ground data. Kian Mirshahi, founder of Mayday.ai, is passionate about democratizing access to disaster information and is working to build a community-level ecosystem for proactive disaster management and resiliency.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen major events happen, people turn to Twitter to share what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve witnessed, document what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in real-time, and to get key information. This wildfire season, Mayday.ai is set to combine data from the unfolding conversation on Twitter with its proprietary incident detection system, which is based on satellite sensors,\u00c2\u00a0 an array of 35,000 traffic cameras, and IP911 to power a comprehensive detection and a highly targeted notification tracker. Mayday.ai has developed a comprehensive dispatch platform and a mobile app which will provide first responders and civilians unprecedented access to real-time incident information -- and has so far had much success in detecting wildfires using its proprietary platform and is being used as a template for other disasters in Mayday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s roadmap.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWildfires are one disaster that humans can prevent with a culture shift in disaster management policies and practices,\nKian Mirshahi\nfounder of Mayday.ai\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe opportunity costs of our current reactive and disconnected practices are tremendous and continue to increase. Mayday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proactive and integrated approach uses satellite imaging, multiple data sources, and machine learning capabilities to identify fires faster than anything else can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So far this year, Mayday has detected almost all reported wildfires in the Americas ahead of 911 reports, with some as early as four hours.\u00c2\u00a0\nMayday uses data from the conversation on Twitter to analyze social media sentiment and gain critical information from people at the scene. They track keywords and event-centric groupings with hashtags, for example, #Easyfire. Once a fire is named, that hashtag is used to track all data on Twitter and filter critical information to responders and continuously refined via natural language processing. Mayday is also providing visual data through geotagged images and videos shared on Twitter. These event-centric innovations with social sentiment analysis, combined with a multitude of sensors from 22,000 miles above sea all the way to ground-level, give Mayday.ai an incredible and highly disruptive edge in real-time disaster services.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe see Twitter as a source of critical information from citizen journalists and witnesses.

Will work from home, learn from home and exercise from home be the new norm? Will bikes and walking begin to displace cars and crowded transit? Is business travel as we knew it finished? These questions and more are being asked by organizations trying to make sense of the past three months and the long term implications. Many will look to market research to try and understand what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening and predict the future. But after such an unprecedented event, can people clearly articulate how it has impacted their lives?\u00c2\u00a0 This question hits at a much bigger challenge of market research and traditional methods such as surveys and focus groups: people aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very good at articulating what they think about certain topics or what they may do in the future.\u00c2\u00a0\nTraditional market research often asks consumers to share their feelings about products, services and experiences, but this approach is inevitably biased by virtue of the very questions presented and the specific words used. For example, 'How did you find your stay?' will elicit a different response than, 'Did you enjoy your stay?' This framing, as it is known, guides participants down specific paths, encouraging filtered, rational and retrospective responses. But, unfortunately, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not how we as humans make decisions.\nPreviously, I wrote about how our emotions extend to decision-making and how numerous studies reveal that our behaviours are often guided by non-conscious drivers. Put another way, we are often unreliable witnesses to our own actions and beliefs. So how do we infer what people really feel on a subject? The key is to capture unprompted reactions in the moment when they are actually happening. These \u00e2\u0080\u0098non-framed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thoughts tend to be more accurate and more authentic because they represent true emotion and are without bias.\nOne place you can find a vast amount of unprompted reactions on a host of topics is social data. Twitter, in particular, sees hundreds of millions of thoughts, experiences and opinions shared on the platform every day. These tweets provide unique qualitative insights, shedding light on underlying motivations, emerging behaviours and new norms.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter has always been a great place to see these trends emerge, allowing you to develop hypotheses which can then be tested and further refined with qualitative and quantitative research methods. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this combining of stated preferences with revealed behaviours that provides a more complete, nuanced perspective on a given topic. Twitter is also proving a useful proxy for brand tracking and benchmarking studies. These well-established longitudinal studies typically rely on surveys and are generally performed only once a year. However, leveraging consumer feedback from Twitter makes continuous brand tracking possible and cost-effective. \nAs to \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, a YouGov poll from mid-April found that only 9% of Britons want life to return to 'normal' once lockdown is over. But can they be believed? To quote the American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nInterested in obtaining better insights on topics important to you?

To start, open the Tweet composer and tap the new icon with wavelengths.

The account sets we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re publishing to the archive today include three distinct operations that we have attributed to the People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and Turkey respectively. Every account and piece of content associated with these operations has been permanently removed from the service. In addition, we have shared relevant data from this disclosure with two leading research partners: Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and Stanford Internet Observatory (SIO).\nIn all instances, accounts were suspended for various violations of our platform manipulation policies.\u00c2\u00a0\nPeople\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China (PRC)\nWhile this network is new, the technical links we used to identify the activity and attribute it to the PRC remain consistent with activity we initially identified and disclosed in August 2019. Our proactive removal of this network from Twitter is a direct result of the technical efforts we instituted after thoroughly studying and investigating past coordinated information operations from the PRC.\nToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s PRC disclosure relates to two interconnected sets of accounts:\n23,750 accounts that comprise the core of the network, e.g. the highly engaged core network.\nApproximately 150,000 accounts that were designed to boost this content, e.g. the amplifiers. Based on feedback from researchers on our prior disclosures that we need to better refine the disclosure process to enable efficient investigation of the core activity, we have not included the 150,000 amplifier accounts in the public archive.\nDespite the volume, the core 23,750 accounts we are publishing to the archive were largely caught early and failed to achieve considerable traction on the service, typically holding low follower accounts and low engagement. Of the approximately 150,000 amplifier accounts, the majority had little to no follower counts either and were strategically designed to artificially inflate impression metrics and engage with the core accounts.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn general, this entire network was involved in a range of manipulative and coordinated activities. They were Tweeting predominantly in Chinese languages and spreading geopolitical narratives favorable to the Communist Party of China (CCP), while continuing to push deceptive narratives about the political dynamics in Hong Kong.\u00c2\u00a0\nRussia\u00c2\u00a0\nAided in part by useful information sharing from external researchers and our peer companies, we investigated accounts associated with Current Policy, a media website engaging in state-backed political propaganda within Russia. A network of accounts related to this media operation was suspended for violations of our platform manipulation policy, specifically cross-posting and amplifying content in an inauthentic, coordinated manner for political ends. Activities included promoting the United Russia party and attacking political dissidents. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing all 1,152 accounts and associated media to our public archive today.\u00c2\u00a0\nTurkey\nDetected in early 2020, this network of accounts was employing coordinated inauthentic activity, which was primarily targeted at domestic audiences within Turkey. Based on our analysis of the network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical indicators and account behaviors, the collection of fake and compromised accounts was being used to amplify political narratives favorable to the AK Parti, and demonstrated strong support for President Erdogan. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing 7,340 accounts to the archive today.\nTechnical signals point to the network being associated with the youth wing of the party and a centralized network that maintained a significant number of compromised accounts. As a result, the network we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing today includes several compromised accounts associated with organizations critical of President Erdogan and the Turkish Government. These compromised accounts have been repeated targets of account hacking and takeover efforts by the state actors identified above. The broader network was also used for commercial activities, such as cryptocurrency-related spam.\u00c2\u00a0\nNext steps for this work\nUltimately our goal is to serve the public conversation, remove bad faith actors, and to advance public understanding of these critical topics. In the future we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to:\nOffer more clarity in the public archive around impression counts and attempt to further measure the tangible impact of information operations on the public conversation.\nContinue to formalize our academic partnerships to ensure they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re globally diverse and advancing public understanding of these issues.\nHost an online conference later in the summer to bring experts, industry, and government together to discuss opportunities for further collaboration.\nOur Site Integrity efforts represent some of the most critical work we do at Twitter to protect the public conversation.

Amid the already growing fear and uncertainty around the pandemic, last week again brought attention to something perhaps more pervasive: the long-standing racism and injustices faced by Black and Brown people on a daily basis.\nThe recent killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade and George Floyd, and the victimization of Christian Cooper have left many of us angry, and with a deep sense of grief. But that grief doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compare to what Black people face every day. #SayTheirNames\nNow is a time to take care \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and take action. Now is a time for #Allyship. At Twitter, our principles of allyship are simple: Learn, Ask, Show up, and Speak up.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLearn \nDo your own research. To practice allyship, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to first understand the historical and structural contexts that have led to racism and discrimination that are so ingrained in society.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere is recommended reading to get started on your journey,\u00c2\u00a0 Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong, How to be an Anti-Racist, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho gets to be afraid in America?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Also check out this Anti-Racism Resource Guide.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAsk\nUnderstand that answering questions takes emotional labor \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be mindful of safe spaces and make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done your personal learning before you ask a Black person to share with you.\nApproach questions with empathy and in a way to understand people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lived experiences. Do not approach asking questions from a place of disbelief. Some questions you could ask include:\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have the time/energy, do you feel comfortable sharing your experience with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis week is heavy. How are you feeling/coping?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNote: When someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharing their experience with you, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to simply say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hear you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like you need to respond, or provide your own story.

Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in your circle? Who do you turn to for advice? Who do you follow and engage with on social media?\nDo not re-share pictures and videos of violence perpetrated against Black people. While we may want to increase awareness, such media can be triggering and retraumatizing. \nWhile social distancing, it may seem difficult to show up physically for your colleagues or the Black community. Do it virtually \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but without expectations. This is about them, not you.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSpeak up\nIn meetings, on social media, in conference calls, in chats with friends and family.

Since our last update, we transitioned more than 5,000 Tweeps to a fully virtual workforce, introduced new programs and benefits, and doubled down on inclusion in the age of COVID-19. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve accomplished a lot \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and learned some important lessons along the way.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere are the four key principles that have guided our Inclusion & Diversity response at Twitter:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPut people first \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and really listen\nOur priority has always been our Tweeps, their safety, well-being, and security. In February, we were one of the first companies to announce a global WFH policy \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 for us it was an easy decision. But it still required a massive amount of work to operationalize.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe created Slack channels specifically to answer questions related to COVID-19, launched a COVID-19 focused global survey to take the pulse of our Tweeps, hosted more global all hands meetings to check in on everyone, and increased opportunities to connect virtually across teams \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially our Business Resource Groups (BRGs).\nWorking from home, and trying to work at home during a global pandemic are different. So we re-evaluated our global benefits to identify opportunities for enhancements. In addition to reimbursing expenses associated with Tweeps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 WFH setup, we also increased our investments in mental and physical health benefits, and explored ways to better support caregivers learning to navigate our new reality.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLead with empathy and flexibility\nOur deep listening produced some common themes. People were having difficulty focusing, and productivity was being impacted by the pandemic. This was especially true for Tweeps from communities of color, caregivers and/or those at higher risk of infection. So we introduced resources to help managers prioritize their own well being while managing a team, foster deeper empathy between managers and their direct reports, paused 2020 performance ratings, and made room for Tweeps to operate at reduced capacity when needed.\nIn partnership with @TwitterParents, we launched a special listening session for parents. What we heard was that our recently-introduced supplemental child care benefit wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t having the impact that we hoped because of shelter in place orders. What parents \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 and everyone \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 needed was more flexibility to manage through the pandemic in a way that worked for them. So we introduced flexible work schedules for Tweeps who needed extra time to take care of themselves and their families, and coached managers on how to lean in to asynchronous work, allowing Tweeps to get their work done how and when it suits them. And since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no keeping the kids out of the home office, we launched a weekly storytime with Twitter leadership to give everyone a break.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe emphasized decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce, even before the pandemic started, which allowed us to quickly transition our Tweeps to being fully virtual. The past few months have proven this works for us and we made working from home an option for everyone whose roles allow it, permanently \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 even after the pandemic ends. This decision will help drive workforce diversity by ensuring anyone, anywhere, can work for Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCultivate allyship\nThe virus doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discriminate. Unfortunately, some people do. So we teamed up with @TwitterAsians to host Flock Talks for the entire company about COVID-19 and racism. We know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a direct correlation between conversations like these and the health of our workplace and our service. Tweeps from across the globe came together to share personal stories about the impact of COVID-19 and how people can be allies during the pandemic.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop there. Via #TwitterTeamUp, we brought together a cross-functional group of leaders from BRGs, Product, Policy, and Trust & Safety to discuss the work being done to prevent misinformation around COVID-19 and anti-Asian rhetoric on the platform. We also launched a campaign focused on #AllyshipRightNow to address hate speech, encourage allyship, and create a space where personal stories from the Asian community could be shared.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nConversation about COVID-19 in the US must include its disproportionate impact on diverse communities. Via #DiversityPartnerships, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hosted a weekly series focusing on underrepresented communities to call attention to the unique challenges they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re each facing during this crisis.

But, what if the ability to gather and share critical information, access essential products and services, learn and work from home effectively, connect with our loved ones, and speak truth to power, was taken away from us? Unfortunately, this is the reality for many people around the world.\u00c2\u00a0\nA recent report from Access Now shows an increase in Internet shutdowns globally, with 213 documented shutdowns in 2019 and a concerning trend toward more targeted and prolonged shutdowns. Sometimes known as (Internet) \u00e2\u0080\u0098blackouts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098kill switches\u00e2\u0080\u0099, shutdowns can be highly targeted, focused on specific groups of individuals for the purposes of repressing dissent, to larger shutdowns which can deprive entire communities of essential information and isolate people from their support networks. The deliberate throttling of Internet speeds \u00e2\u0080\u0094 increasingly a tool of repression \u00e2\u0080\u0094 creates friction and barriers to entry for those who need it most.\nTo help raise awareness of this important issue, Twitter is pleased to support the #KeepItOn campaign, with the launch of a special emoji. #KeepItOn is a coalition of more than 200 organisations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from research centers to rights and local advocacy groups, detection networks, and media organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 located within 75 countries around the world, fighting to end Internet shutdowns globally.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter's mission is to serve the public conversation. We are committed to protecting freedom of expression, while encouraging healthy and productive public conversations. Having access to the free and open Internet is a right that many have come to see as essential. It is a right that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly inseparable from free expression, self-determination, and self-actualization.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur right to access news, connection, and medical information on the open Internet is more vital than ever during this pandemic. For some, it may be existential. It acts as a distribution channel for the most up-to-date information on how to prevent the spread of the virus; a directory that points us to the services we need to stay healthy; and a place where we can gather with friends and family. And with our economies reliant on digital technologies and connectivity, an open Internet is a foundational pillar on which recovery must be built.\u00c2\u00a0\nShutdowns can only impede this progress, unnecessarily walling off targeted communities and entire populations. We have also seen a worrying trend towards regulatory action that could see instances of shutdowns increase further. Some of this is motivated by an urgent need to tackle COVID-19 in any way possible \u00e2\u0080\u0094 some isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but the long-term result could be an Internet that is less open, less free, and less empowering for all.\u00c2\u00a0\nThroughout the past weeks and months, we have seen first-hand that the principles of net neutrality and how the open, borderless nature of the Internet has allowed us to stay connected. As we face this pandemic, Twitter is helping people find reliable information, connect with others, and follow what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in real time. In March, we announced that we were contributing to two organizations working tirelessly to uphold the fundamental values of a free press during the pandemic. Additionally, a critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable.\nWorking with our partners across the globe, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve facilitated conversations and the sharing of authoritative and credible information through our #KnowTheFacts prompt, now available in approximately 80 countries, hosting Q&As with the World Health Organization on @Twitter, and launching a global campaign to support the #SafeHands campaign.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe have seen a huge surge in sharing gratitude, with more than 250 million Tweets shared worldwide expressing appreciation since March 15, and celebrating those who are on the frontlines protecting us all.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThese campaigns and global initiatives would not have been possible without the global, open, and interconnected Internet. Today, to support this critical movement, we're encouraging people around the world to make their voices heard by using #KeepItOn.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess to information and freedom of expression are the foundations of our democracy. During a global health crisis, we all should be working to facilitate people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to credible and timely information. Any attempt to throttle, stifle, and shut down the internet including social media during this pandemic and beyond will have a detrimental effect on our collective health and well-being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Berhan Taye, Senior Policy Analyst and Global Internet Shutdowns Lead at Access Now.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\naccessibility\ngovernment\nsociety & culture\ntechnology\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

But sometimes, unwanted replies make it hard to have meaningful conversations. (Ahem, reply guys.) Since last year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to give people more control over their conversations starting with the ability to hide replies. We also began trying out new ways to start conversations with casual, fleeting thoughts.

So, we're exploring how we can improve these settings to give people more opportunities to weigh in while still giving people control over the conversations they start.

Over time, however, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s become a loaded and often misunderstood term.\u00c2\u00a0\nPeople often refer to bots when describing everything from automated account activity to individuals who would prefer to be anonymous for personal or safety reasons, or avoid a photo because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got strong privacy concerns. The term is used to mischaracterize accounts with numerical usernames that are auto-generated when your preference is taken, and more worryingly, as a tool by those in positions of political power to tarnish the views of people who may disagree with them or online public opinion that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not favorable.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere are also many commercial services that purport to offer insights on bots and their activity online, and frequently their focus is entirely on Twitter due to the free data we provide through our public APIs. Unfortunately, this research is rarely peer-reviewed and often does not hold up to scrutiny, further confusing the public's understanding of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really happening.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s break it down and explain the facts.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bot?\u00c2\u00a0\nBased on what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve described above, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of understandable confusion and we need to do a better job of explaining ourselves. In sum, a bot is an automated account \u00e2\u0080\u0094 nothing more or less.\nGoing back a few years, automated accounts were a problem for us. We focused on it, made the investments, and have seen significant gains in tackling them across all surfaces of Twitter. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean our work is done.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more important to focus on in 2020 is the holistic behavior of an account, not just whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automated or not. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why calls for bot labeling don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t capture the problem we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to solve and the errors we could make to real people that need our service to make their voice heard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just a binary question of bot or not \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the gradients in between are what matter. \nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we focus our attention on where the most critical work is. We call it platform manipulation.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform manipulation?\nOur proactive work is focused on manipulation in many forms and that includes the malicious use of automation. As discussed, our policies in this area focus on behavior, not content, and are written in a way that targets the spammy tactics different people or groups could use to try to manipulate conversations on Twitter (rather than on what they're specifically saying).\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note, not all forms of automation are necessarily violations of the Twitter Rules. We've seen innovative and creative uses of automation to enrich the Twitter experience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for example, accounts like @pentametron and @tinycarebot.\u00c2\u00a0\nAutomation can also be a powerful tool in customer service interactions, where a conversational bot can help find information about orders or travel reservations automatically. This is incredibly useful and efficient for small businesses, especially at a time of social distancing.\u00c2\u00a0\nSo what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prohibited?\nMalicious use of automation to undermine and disrupt the public conversation, like trying to get something to trend\nArtificial amplification of conversations on Twitter, including through creating multiple or overlapping accounts\nGenerating, soliciting, or purchasing fake engagements\nEngaging in bulk or aggressive tweeting, engaging, or following\nUsing hashtags in a spammy way, including using unrelated hashtags in a tweet (aka \"hashtag cramming\")\nOur technological power to proactively identify and remove these behaviors across our service is more sophisticated than ever. We permanently suspend millions of accounts every month that are automated or spammy, and we do this before they ever reach an eyeball in a Twitter Timeline or Search.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe also publish data on our removals every six months in the\u00c2\u00a0Twitter Transparency Report.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat about tools like Botometer & Bot Sentinel?\nThese tools start with a human looking at an account \u00e2\u0080\u0094 often using the same public account information you can see on Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and identifying characteristics that make it a bot. So in essence, the account name, the level of Tweeting, the location in the bio, the hashtags used etc.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis is an extremely limited approach.\nAs mentioned, an account with a strange handle is often someone who was automatically recommended that username because their real-name was taken at sign-up. An account with no photo or location may be someone who has personal feelings on online privacy or whose use of Twitter may expose them to risk, like an activist or dissident. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to add much of a bio or your location to your account? Some of us at Twitter don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either. Even if all of these public details are put into a machine learning model to try to probabilistically predict if an account is a bot, when they rely on human analysis of public account information, that process contains biases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from the start.\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take some other everyday examples for clarity. Someone who Tweets 100 times a day with #SuperBowl could just be an extremely engaged individual who loves football (or hates it if their team is bad). If you care deeply about the environment and Tweet about it at a certain political moment when you and your friends want to make an impact, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not \u00e2\u0080\u009cpolitical bots\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you're active citizens organizing an organic online campaign to drive change in your community.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese tools do not account for these common Twitter use cases, how far we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come, and how things have evolved. As a result nuance can be lost. The outcome? Binary judgments of who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbot or not\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which have real potential to poison our public discourse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly when they are pushed out through the media.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re perfect. Of course not. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that the threat has evolved and the narrative on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually going on is increasingly behind the curve.\nIf I see suspicious activity, can I report it?\u00c2\u00a0\nYes. If you see\u00c2\u00a0suspicious activity, report it to us. We add your signal to the hundreds of others we use to inform our technical approach.\nIf we want to create a healthy information ecosystem, we all have a part to play. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reinforced these points many times and we will get stronger and more direct in our public efforts at this critical moment in the global public conversation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re keenly aware of our responsibility in this space. That includes protecting the integrity of our service, continuing to keep platform manipulation off of Twitter, and leading with transparency by sharing regular updates on our progress and learnings.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nBots\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

People in America donated food (18k mentions), made masks for medical personnel (12k mentions), and promoted the message of shopping local (8.1k mentions.) In Canada, volunteering to help the vulnerable and elderly was the most popular act, followed by donations of money, food, blood and PPE. India (English mentions) was also a huge driver of conversation. Their donations were also the most popular charitable act, with 78k mentions.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are dealing with a high level of change and\u00c2\u00a0 they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adapting to new circumstances and taking on new activities. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been incredible to watch this evolve through social listening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Miller.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese insights and the ever changing conversation has helped our customers rethink how they engage and support consumers\u00e2\u0080\u009d, says Miller.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA lot of our clients are really keen to broadly understand how people are feeling, because striking the right tone with their content, the campaigns and products is so key at the moment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Miller. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect that a lot of brands are making changes now that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep in place permanently.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\nSprinklr \nBy March, when COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, Sprinklr, the NYC-based Customer Experience Management (CXM) platform for large organizations, used its AI capabilities to analyze over 600 million Tweets to learn more about the conversation on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter gives organizations the opportunity to understand the past context of the conversation and insights to help them anticipate how it might evolve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Paul Herman, Sprinklr VP of Product Marketing.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSprinklr discovered that many of the new and unreported symptoms of COVID-19, like the loss of taste and smell, were initially popping up on Twitter. Many healthcare workers were taking to Twitter to share their frustrations on the lack of PPE, which for government officials, helps them identify which areas are in need of essential resources.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt highlighted for companies an urgency to move towards a more holistic approach to customer experience management,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Herman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cResearch is one thing, but research combined with customer care combined with marketing as a holistic function is another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0 \nPeople now expect brands and government agencies to be there for them when the situation improves. To Herman, this means brands and governments need to be where these people are, they have to speak to them in a human way and they have to build trust with them.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSprout Social \nTo Patrick Cuttica, the sheer volume of the COVID-19 conversation and the data it generates represents an incredible moment in the history of social listening.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery few events impact every single industry, every single country and every person on this planet, and so I think what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really unique is the scale of what these conversations look like and the far-reaching impact it has,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Patrick Cuttica, Director of Product Marketing at Sprout Social, a company that specializes in deep social media listening and analytics for more than 20,000 brands and agencies.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWhile the pandemic has put a pause on live events like golf tournaments and basketball playoffs, networks are filling the sports void with other types of entertainment.\u00c2\u00a0 \nFor instance, Netflix and ESPN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Last Dance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the documentary series on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, was the most eagerly awaited cultural moment of the summer. But with the NBA season put on hold, basketball fans went on Twitter to plead with ESPN for an earlier release date. It worked, thanks in part to the conversation on social media. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Last Dance\u00e2\u0080\u009d has now become a cultural event in its own right. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the absence of live sports, professional sports teams and events have had to completely shift their overall content strategies on social and beyond during this time. Twitter has played a significant role in that shift, both in the way Twitter data can help inform new strategies and in the way content is distributed and discussed on Twitter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cuttica.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThese current times have also changed how healthcare companies engage with patient communities on Twitter. Sprout Social recently introduced a new product offering within their social listening suite, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID-19 Featured Topic\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This tool gives Sprout customers the ability to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdimension the overall social conversation data set around COVID-19 to understand how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impacting their brand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cuttica. For instance, by using this tool, healthcare customers can define potential trends in the use of associated words and phrases like \u00e2\u0080\u009celective surgery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009chospital access\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpregnancy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would indicate that there was growing uncertainty or concern among patients around the topics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Cuttica, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand hospital systems could get ahead of this uncertainty by proactively clarifying via social content.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nLooking ahead, brands should use their Twitter data to help shape their marketing content and stay up to date on the pulse of the conversation.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter is an amazing platform for showcasing these stories and driving the global conversation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Cuttica. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could be political moments, cultural events, or it could be something like the COVID-19 pandemic where the entire world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online behavior changes almost overnight. People come to Twitter to find information, share opinions and create connections during these times, and this makes Twitter data invaluable for brands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n#DataPartners\n#SocialListening\n#COVID-19\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nCOVID-19\nsocial listening\nDataPartners\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nFive powerful women in data MarTech\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 9 March 2020\n          \nWhy business IQ is not enough in the era of the relationship economy\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 14 February 2020\n          \nIs 2020 the year of prediction?\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 8 January 2020\n          "}

The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to return.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about the next few months:\nOpening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith very few exceptions, offices won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open before September. When we do decide to open offices, it also won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual.\u00c2\u00a0\nThere will also be no business travel before September, with very few exceptions, and no in-person company events for the rest of 2020. We will assess 2021 events later this year.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud of the early action we took to protect the health of our employees and our communities. That will remain our top priority as we work through the unknowns of the coming months.\n#LoveWhereverYouWork\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n March 11, 2020\nMoving to mandatory work from home globally + supporting our employees\u00c2\u00a0 \nOur top priority remains the health and safety of our Tweeps, and we also have a responsibility to support our communities, those who are vulnerable, and the healthcare providers who are on the front lines of this pandemic.\u00c2\u00a0To continue this push, we are moving beyond our earlier guidance of \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrongly encouraging work from home\u00e2\u0080\u009d provided on March 2 and have now informed all employees globally they must work from home.\nWe understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times. And we will continue to do all that we can to support our Tweeps, including:\u00c2\u00a0\nPaying our contractors, vendors and hourly workers For contractors and hourly workers who are not able to perform their responsibilities from home, Twitter will continue to pay their labor costs to cover standard working hours while Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work-from-home guidance and/or travel restrictions related to their assigned office are in effect.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditional resources to support parents As part of our ongoing global benefits support, Twitter is stepping in to ease additional expenses parents may be experiencing when their normal daycare closes due to COVID-19 by providing reimbursement for the additional daycare expenses incurred.\u00c2\u00a0\nHelping Tweeps set up their at-home offices All employees, including hourly workers, will receive reimbursement toward their home office set up expenses, and we are working with our vendors to ensure our contractors' work-from-home needs are met as well. We listened to employee feedback and expanded our policy to include home office equipment, such as desks, desk chairs, and ergonomic chair cushions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also allowing Tweeps to expense online fees while working from home.\n#FlockTalk Last year, we introduced #FlockTalk, a program activated when Tweeps want to come together during difficult times to share what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders. News around COVID-19 is impacting people in a number of different ways -- from schools and offices being closed, to serious health concerns, to racism towards communities, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all dealing with a lot. The Twitter Inclusion & Diversity team (@TwitterTogether) in partnership with @TwitterAsians will host a virtual #FlockTalk that acknowledges there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a direct correlation between conversations between us, the health of our workplace, and the health of our service.\u00c2\u00a0\nResource guides to make the work-from-home transition easier Working from home can be a challenging transition, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided a variety of resource guides to help our employees continue to get the job done. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listing them here as well because at times like this, sharing insights and learning is so important. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all in this together and we want to help others outside of Twitter make their transitions to working outside of their offices easier.\nWorking From Home Best Practices: We have shared the factors to consider to make sure Tweeps are ready to be productive and healthy. Some factors include workspace, communication, self-care, and logging hours. Overall, working from home doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change your day-to-day work, it just means you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be doing it from a different environment.\nManaging a Distributed Team: Being a People manager means providing a consistent and positive employee experience for everyone on your team, regardless of location. This manager resource guide highlights the three key pillars of management: Strategy, Growth and Care. So what changes when your team is fully distributed? The good news\u00e2\u0080\u0094not much! These pillars still apply whether you manage a distributed or co-located team.\u00c2\u00a0\nVirtual Interview Guide: All interviews at Twitter will be done via video conferencing. A completely virtual interview has its benefits. It is ideal for introducing candidates to remote work cultures, and it is a great opportunity for candidates who will work remotely to get a sense for the experience of interacting with other team members remotely.\u00c2\u00a0 While this Virtual Interview Guide is not a holistic Interview Guide, it instead focuses on the aspects of interviewing candidates remotely that differ from interviewing candidates in-person.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe have also shared guides for working across time zones, utilizing collaboration tools to stay connected, and ergonomic tips for working from home and on-the-go.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue sharing information as we navigate these changes. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in dedication to keeping our Tweeps and everyone around us healthy. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all in this together!\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 2, 2020\nEncouraging employees to work from home  In addition to the travel, event and visitor restrictions that we previously shared, today we provided additional guidance as we look to protect the health and safety of our workforce. Beginning today, we are strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able. Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the COVID-19 for us - and the world around us. We are operating out of an abundance of caution and the utmost dedication to keeping our Tweeps healthy.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are working to make sure internal meetings, all hands, and other important tasks are optimized for remote participation. We recognize that working from home is not ideal for some job functions. For those employees who prefer or need to come into the offices, they will remain open for business. Our Real Estate & Workplace team is increasing deep cleaning and sanitizing in all spaces, as well as more visual reminders for personal hygiene best practices and pre-packaged, pre-composed, and pre-plated food options. \nWorking from home will be mandatory for employees based in our Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea offices due in part to government restrictions. Our criteria will evolve over time as we get more information, and we will communicate to affected Tweeps as appropriate. \nWhile this is a big change for us, we have already been moving towards a more distributed workforce that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s increasingly remote. We're a global service and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to enabling anyone, anywhere to work at Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMarch 1, 2020\nSuspending non-critical business travel and events  We recently shared information about the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to surface the right information, to promote constructive engagement, and to highlight credible information around the spread of #coronavirus COVID-19. We will continue to update the public on these efforts this week.\nWe also have the responsibility of ensuring that the health and safety of our employees and partners is not compromised. We have continued to monitor the situation closely and are adjusting our internal policies to respond to this rapidly-evolving situation. On February 29, we informed our people and started notifying partners that we are suspending all non-critical business travel and events.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThis policy is effective immediately and will continue until the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control deem it appropriate to step back from pandemic precautionary measures or when a vaccine becomes available.\u00c2\u00a0 \nOur goal is to reduce the risk that anyone at Twitter might contract or inadvertently spread the virus. It is important that we take these proactive steps to protect ourselves and others and minimize the spread of COVID-19.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThere are enormous transnational efforts underway to tackle this virus. As a global company with a global workforce, we want to do what we can to help the success of these multi-stakeholder containment efforts. Temporarily suspending travel is an immediate and important step. \nWe want to thank our people, partners and customers for their patience and understanding.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nCOVID-19\nsafety\npartners\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

While this happens in myriad ways every day at Twitter, we focus on two global days of service annually to harness this energy at scale for maximum impact.\u00c2\u00a0\nOn May 8, we launched our first-ever fully remote Twitter for Good Day. It was fun, it was meaningful, and it required a complete shift in thinking as we all continue to battle #COVID19.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIt became clear in late February that this year would look very different. Our plan to revitalize parks, visit classrooms, and prepare and serve meals in local communities around the world ground to a halt. We faced a decision to cancel the day outright or to reimagine what it might look like for Tweeps to give back from their homesinstead at physical locations within the community.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs it turns out, the decision was easy: The need in communities around the world had never been greater, and our employees were eager \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and yearned \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to give back.\u00c2\u00a0\nQ&A sessions with Jack\nIn line with our global approach to Twitter for Good, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey kicked off the first ever remote day of service by hosting Periscope Q&A sessions live on Twitter with nonprofit leaders in every corner of the world.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMore than 130,000 people tuned in to hear these conversations with Project RockIt in Australia, SpunOut in Ireland, Voz de Comunidades in Brazil, the Houston Food Bank, and Code Tenderloin in San Francisco. These participating organizations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 diverse in location, mission, and purpose \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are all longstanding Twitter partners. As the world has shifted to care for their communities amid COVID-19, these conversations reflected the work of nonprofit partners and their agile response tomeet the needs of the people they serve.\u00c2\u00a0\nActivations and outcomes\nIn total, we organized 52 projects, contributed more than 1,500 hours of service, and donated $165,000 (and counting) through our Employee Matching program in the month of May alone.\u00c2\u00a0\nTweeps baked cakes in France for frontline workers, joined a conversation about the risks of domestic violence during COVID in Singapore, prepared food provisions for high-risk populations in Mexico, and faced the daunting challenge of trying to prove they are smarter than a 5th grader in a high-stakes trivia match with students at DeMarillac Academy in San Francisco.\nWhile Twitter provided a set of opportunities for every employee to volunteer, give, or learn, we know that many employees pursued a cause of their own. One example was the ingenuity of a Tweep who used a 3D printer to make mask straps for frontline workers. Through it all, the love, care, and compassion Tweeps felt for our community partners was alive and kicking; a testament to the power of service regardless of the events taking place outside Twitter.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nOur first global remote day of service made this abundantly clear: Our community partners are struggling to meet the exponentially increased demand for their services, and we need to embrace our charitable giving, nonprofit partnerships and on-service support for these organizations now more than ever.\nThis Twitter for Good Day showed us yet again that our community partners and our employees are extraordinarily creative, adaptable, and ready to meet the challenges of our communities. The strength of a virtual day of service is that it allows each of us to approach today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pressing issues in our own unique way \u00e2\u0080\u0094 empowered to innovate, adapt, and give back.\nTwitter for Good Day may occur only twice a year, but we know that the real work happens in between, every day and every week. The spirit of giving continues to take flight at Twitter, and we are committed to staying the course as long as it is needed, for our communities and all those in need.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Starting today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing new labels and warning messages that will provide additional context and information on some Tweets containing disputed or misleading information related to COVID-19.\nIn March, we broadened our policy guidance to address content that goes directly against guidance on COVID-19 from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Moving forward, we may use these labels and warning messages to provide additional explanations or clarifications in situations where the risks of harm associated with a Tweet are less severe but where people may still be confused or misled by the content. This will make it easier to find facts and make informed decisions about what people see on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nNew labels and warnings\nDuring active conversations about disputed issues, it can be helpful to see additional context from trusted sources. Earlier this year, we introduced a new label for Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media. Similar labels will now appear on Tweets containing potentially harmful, misleading information related to COVID-19. This will also apply to Tweets sent before today.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThese labels will link to a Twitter-curated page or external trusted source containing additional information on the claims made within the Tweet.\u00c2\u00a0\nDepending on the propensity for harm and type of misleading information, warnings may also be applied to a Tweet.

These systems help ensure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not amplifying Tweets with these warnings or labels and detecting the high-visibility content quickly. Additionally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to rely on trusted partners to identify content that is likely to result in offline harm. Given the dynamic situation, we will prioritize review and labeling of content that could lead to increased exposure or transmission.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn a lot as we use these new labels, and are open to adjusting as we explore labeling different types of misleading information.

Despite the challenges, the election recorded a historic 66.2% voter turnout, the highest in three decades for a parliamentary election. Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role was even more critical as campaigns went virtual and people relied more than ever on online information. As such, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission of serving the public conversation remained core, and we ensured Twitter supported the participatory discussion every step of this election cycle.\u00c2\u00a0\nProtecting the integrity of the #KoreanElection2020 conversation on Twitter\nIn preparation, Twitter verified the accounts of 10 different regional election commissions, five political parties, and 94 candidates so that people could check the authenticity of information on the service. Two days prior to the election, @TwitterKorea also announced the official Twitter accounts of 140 candidates from eleven political parties and also the nine political party accounts that had also joined the live national conversation. By following these accounts, people were able to receive the latest updates including candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pledges and campaign schedules, or to send a Twitter mention or direct message (DM) to ask questions.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFighting platform manipulation and spam was a high priority. In the service of\u00c2\u00a0 protecting the integrity of the election conversation, Twitter partnered with the Korean National Election Commission (@necmedia2017) to tackle issues such as deliberate election disinformation and clear violations of the Twitter Rules. Throughout the cycle we took enforcement\u00c2\u00a0 action against bad-faith accounts who tried to manipulate the service and spread misinformation around the election.\u00c2\u00a0 \nEmpowering and amplifying the election conversation\nTo help support and drive the public's interest in the election on Twitter, we launched a custom emoji 20 days prior to the election day in partnership with the National Election Commission. The emoji symbolized the voting stamp and was automatically generated by hashtags #KoreanElection, #KoreanElection2020, #\u00ed\u0088\u00ac\u00ed\u0091\u009c(Voting), #\u00ed\u0088\u00ac\u00ed\u0091\u009c\u00ec\u009d\u00b8\u00ec\u00a6\u009d(ProofOfVoting), #\u00ed\u0088\u00ac\u00ed\u0091\u009c\u00ed\u0095\u0098\u00ec\u0084\u00b8\u00ec\u009a\u0094(PleaseVote), #\u00ed\u0088\u00ac\u00ed\u0091\u009c\u00ed\u0096\u0088\u00ec\u0096\u00b4\u00ec\u009a\u0094(IVoted), #21\u00eb\u008c\u0080\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ed\u009a\u008c\u00ec\u009d\u0098\u00ec\u009b\u0090\u00ec\u0084\u00a0\u00ea\u00b1\u00b0(21stLegislativeElection), and #415\u00ec\u00b4\u009d\u00ec\u0084\u00a0(April15Election).

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to work toward our goal of achieving 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. While we work to reach that target, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also offsetting our current carbon emissions through the climate change and environmental nonprofit Cool Effect. Tweeps from around the globe voted last year and we selected three distinct projects as the financial beneficiaries of our offsetting initiatives:\n\u00e2\u0098\u009d\u00ef\u00b8\u008fProtecting Brazil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jacund\u00c3\u00a1 Forest Reserve \u00e2\u0080\u0094 This reserve strives to improve conservation of the rainforest while working to protect the livelihoods of those who live and work there.\n\u00e2\u009c\u008c\u00ef\u00b8\u008fTree planting initiatives in India, Kenya, and Uganda \u00e2\u0080\u0094 This project helps small communities replant trees so they can counter the effects of poverty, deforestation, and harmful carbon emissions.\n\u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u009fA biodiversity protection project in Indonesia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Indonesia is losing forests at the rate of half a million hectares a year, which is one of the highest rates in the world. The Rimba Raya Biodiversity Reserve, the largest REDD+ project in the world, works to preserve these forests and stop development and deforestation.\nOnce again this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be building on these partnerships and continuing to support the areas where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making the largest sustainability impact.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe made a decision early on for our employees globally to work from home to support efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19. Over the past year, we've also celebrated significant achievements in our Twitter offices and maintained momentum while working remotely.\u00c2\u00a0\nHighlights from our work leading up to the 50th anniversary include:\nOffice Build-Outs: We will continue to work closely with our Real Estate and Workplace team to ensure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re retrofitting and installing environmentally-friendly water faucets and achieving at least 95% \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen Certified\u00e2\u0080\u009d status and using 100% Carbon Neutral Energy in our directly-leased buildings by 2025. To date, 92% of our global office space is Green Building Certified Spaces.\nEnergy: In 2019, Twitter converted 300,000+ square feet of office space, or roughly 300kWh/mo of standard grid electricity to 100% renewable energy through PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Solar Choice Program in our San Francisco office.\nSustainability Team: In 2019, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Real Estate & Workplace team formally developed a Workplace Sustainability Team focusing on implementing sustainability standards and reducing our impact on the environment. This team also created resources for employees to encourage environmentally healthy habits, even as we work from home.\u00c2\u00a0\nPlastic Use: By reducing our single-use plastic consumption, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve effectively removed more than 100,000+ plastic straws, 70,000+ plastic toothbrushes, and 35,000+ single-use plastic beverage bottles from our offices per year.\nRecycled Products: We continue to strive to introduce and increase pre- and post-consumer recycled content in our office supply. In 2019, we introduced 100% recycled content mailer packages in our San Francisco mailroom and are still working toward our goal of utilizing 100% recycled paper products by the end of 2020. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also partnered with TerraCycle in several offices to recycle products that otherwise would not be recyclable through existing municipal systems (i.e., plastic bags, plastic shipping material, pens, and other writing utensils).\nComposting: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re actively composting in more than a third of our offices around the world to divert organic waste away from landfills \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we will meet a 50% target in 2021. For example, after introducing this in our Atlanta office in 2019, we were able to divert 244 pounds of organic waste from landfills in less than six months.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow Twitter employees are getting involved We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created an internal programming to encourage Tweeps to learn, participate in the conversation, and engage in remote volunteer activities to celebrate the day. We also set up a dedicated internal #EarthDay2020 campaign page through our employee donation matching program to support organizations working on environmental conservation and sustainability. Any Twitter employee can donate to relevant nonprofit organizations and Twitter will match donations up to a maximum amount per employee.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat can you do? From charitable contributions, watching documentaries, and reading scientific material to DIY projects in your community or volunteering your time and talents \u00e2\u0080\u0094 there are a number of ways for people to get involved in Earth Day, even while we #StayHome.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe encourage you to Tweet using the hashtag #EarthDay to help spread awareness about the 50th-anniversary celebration and let the world know what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to doing this year to increase environmental sustainability.

Not too long after that first Tweet our first API was launched, giving developers the ability to access and analyze data created from that public conversation. Like Twitter, the impact of social media data analysis has evolved considerably over the years. Today, people are tapping into Twitter data to support a broad array of information needs including measuring content and campaign performance, trend detection, influencer discovery and market research.\nBased on my experience and personal observations working with hundreds of organizations over the years, when it comes to putting this unique data source to work to support better decision-making, most organizations can be categorized within three stages of social intelligence maturity.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nStage 1 - Emerging (Brand monitoring)\nIn the first stage of maturity, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likely to be the marketing and communications teams engaging with social data -\u00c2\u00a0 primarily using social media monitoring tools to track social media content performance and brand mentions for public relations and crisis alerting purposes. In fact, according to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Social Data Insights Report (based on data from a study commissioned with the Harris Poll), 9 out of 10 companies use social data for marketing purposes. Metrics such as likes and follows as well as the volume of mentions and associated sentiment are front and center. At this stage, organizations tend to view social data analysis purely through an isolated lens of optimizing their social media campaigns and monitoring brand health. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing is a broader awareness of the value that social data can provide across their organization.\nCompanies at this emerging stage of maturity would benefit from a few simple efforts that could expose the wider business to the value of social insights. \"Oftentimes people have to experience social data for themselves before they really get it, so starting small with a defined project, and sharing relevant insights is key to growing adoption,\" says Jillian Ney, Founder of The Social Intelligence Lab.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nStage 2 - Established (Social listening)\nAt the established stage, social media data analysis branches out from the marketing communications function and starts to be viewed as a useful source of consumer insights. It, however, tends to be leveraged in an ad hoc, reactive manner with requests bubbling up from different parts of the business to whoever has access and training on the organization's social listening tool. And due to this lack of clear ownership, organizations are slow to develop competencies in this area and tend to have multiple social media listening and analytics tools which are underutilized or not fit for purpose. And while organizations at this stage are starting to get clear value from social media data, for the most part it remains a siloed data source not used in conjunction with other research methodologies and/or data sources.\nMany organizations at this stage feel they have checked the box of social listening and yet are vastly underutilizing its potential. They would do well to clearly define their social listening objectives and align those with the key questions the business needs answering.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nStage 3 - Innovator (Social intelligence)\nAn organization becomes an innovator when social media data is viewed as an important and unique source of consumer intelligence, helping to make more informed decisions across their business. As a result, it is embedded into their market research and customer feedback management efforts. In these organizations, you typically find a central analytics or consumer insights team driving cross-functional data analysis efforts that encompass social media data, integrating it with other data sources such as their own 1st party data. These organizations are not only advanced users of their social media listening and analytics tools but are also comfortable working with raw social media data and connecting directly to the social media platforms\u00e2\u0080\u0099 APIs. This allows them to pull social media data into their business intelligence tools to look for patterns and relationships between various data sets. Some may even employ their own approaches to NLP(natural language processing) for topic modelling and sentiment analysis.\nOrganizations at this stage have gone beyond the simple volumetric analysis common of stage two behaviours and strive to understand the context behind social media conversations. Crucially, they understand social media data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strengths, the questions it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good at answering and when it should be utilized. Generally speaking, they excel at social media data analysis because they excel at data analysis and see it as a competitive advantage.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe social intelligence journey\nIn the fourteen years since Jack\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first tweet, social media data analysis has become an accepted part of consumer research. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not without its challenges and detractors, but remains an incredible realtime source of insight into our moods and mindsets as well as our views on anything and everything from the trendy to the mundane. It is the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group, unique in its ability to provide answers to questions we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think to ask.\n So regardless of which stage of maturity you currently find yourself, if leveraging this giant focus group called Twitter is important to you, we are here to help.

We want to be clear: while we work to ensure our systems are consistent, they can sometimes lack the context that our teams bring, and this may result in us making mistakes. As a result, we will not permanently suspend any accounts based solely on our automated enforcement systems. Instead, we will continue to look for opportunities to build in human review checks where they will be most impactful. We appreciate your patience as we work to get it right \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this is a necessary step to scale our work to protect the conversation on Twitter. \nHow are we using automated technology during this time?\nTo help us review reports more efficiently by surfacing content that's most likely to cause harm and should be reviewed first.\nTo help us proactively identify rule-breaking content before it's reported. Our systems learn from past decisions by our review teams, so over time, the technology is able to help us rank content or challenge accounts automatically.\nFor content that requires additional context, such as misleading information around COVID-19, our teams will continue to review those reports manually.\nWhat you can expect if you file a report during this time:\nIf you've reported an account or Tweet to us, it will take longer than normal for us to get back to you. We appreciate your patience as we continue to make adjustments.\nBecause these automated systems don't have all of the context and insight our team has, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make mistakes. If you think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a mistake, you can let us know and appeal here.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe appreciate your patience as we work to keep our teams safe, while also making sure we're protecting everyone on Twitter. You can always continue to use hide replies, mute, block, reply filters, and the other tools we offer you to control conversations on the service.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nKeeping the service running and the Tweets flowing is one of our top priorities in these difficult times. Our work has never been more critical and our service has never been in higher demand. In the past few weeks, we have seen more and more people turn to Twitter to participate in the public conversation and follow what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in real time.\nThe global conversation about COVID-19 and ongoing product improvements are driving up total monetizable DAU (mDAU), with quarter-to-date average total mDAU reaching approximately 164 million, up 23% from 134 million in Q1 2019 and up 8% from 152 million in Q4 2019.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen a 45% increase in our curated events page usage and a 30% increase in Direct Message (DM) usage since March 6.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile many of our teams are transitioning to working from home, some of our infrastructure teams have physical responsibilities that are critical to keeping our data centers, and Twitter, up and running. These teams are operating under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cessential services\u00e2\u0080\u009d provisions dedicated in City, County and State orders to ensure business continuity. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the Tweets flowing without their daily dedication and hard work.\nThe combination of the new work environment and the increased load on our platform has placed unique stresses on our operations, requiring our engineering teams to work more closely together than ever to respond to new demands, and to plan for the future. From our IT, Network and Product Engineering teams to our infrastructure and data center teams, we have collectively mobilized to ensure we are able to stay safe and productive under the stress of the new levels of traffic we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing on our service.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe effects of COVID-19 on Twitter have already surpassed any event we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that as the pandemic continues, we will see additional stress on our service. Beyond Twitter, COVID-19 has also had a far-sweeping impact on our supply chain partners. Whereas normally we'd have months of lead time to add hardware capacity for expected growth, in this case, manufacturing delays in China have compromised the supply chain, resulting in delays in deliveries to our data centers. Our Data Center, SiteOps, Supply Chain, Hardware Engineering and Mission Critical teams continue to manage the physical infrastructure that underlies the service -- expertly innovating to unlock additional capacity in existing supply.\nOur teams are actively addressing areas where we need to add capacity to critical services, looking at how we can optimize existing technology to be more performant, and planning for how we might adjust to the way people are using Twitter during this time.\u00c2\u00a0 \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical for Twitter to stay up and running through this global crisis. Our teams are focused, and as we make changes to our systems to meet these new demands, we will communicate openly. We will share what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned, and if we see incidents, what we will do to recover as quickly as possible. Follow @TwitterEng to stay up to date.\u00c2\u00a0 \n\u00c2\u00a0\nBroadening our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information. Rather than reports, we will enforce this in close coordination with trusted partners, including public health authorities and governments, and continue to use and consult with information from those sources when reviewing content.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to prioritize removing content when it has a clear call to action that could directly pose a risk to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health or well-being, but we want to make it clear that we will not be able to take enforcement action on every Tweet that contains incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19. This is not meant to limit good faith discussion or expressing hope about ongoing studies related to potential medical interventions that show promise.\nSince introducing these policies on March 18, we have removed more than 1,100 tweets containing misleading and potentially harmful content from Twitter. Additionally, our automated systems have challenged more than 1.5 million accounts which were targeting discussions around COVID-19 with spammy or manipulative behaviors. We will continue to use both technology and our teams to help us identify and stop spammy behavior and accounts.\nWe may also apply the public interest notice in cases where world leaders violate the COVID-19 guidelines.\nUnder this guidance, we will require people to remove tweets that include: \nDenial of global or local health authority recommendations to decrease someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s likelihood of exposure to COVID-19 with the intent to influence people into acting against recommended guidance, such as: \u00e2\u0080\u009csocial distancing is not effective\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or actively encouraging people to not socially distance themselves in areas known to be impacted by COVID-19 where such measures have been recommended by the relevant authorities.\nDescription of alleged cures for. COVID-19, which are not immediately harmful but are known to be ineffective, are not applicable to the COVID-19 context, or are being shared with the intent to mislead others, even if made in jest, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoronavirus is not heat-resistant - walking outside is enough to disinfect you\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cuse aromatherapy and essential oils to cure COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDescription of harmful treatments or protection measures which are known to be ineffective, do not apply to COVID-19, or are being shared out of context to mislead people, even if made in jest, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cdrinking bleach and ingesting colloidal silver will cure COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nDenial of established scientific facts about transmission during the incubation period or transmission guidance from global and local health authorities, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID-19 does not infect children because we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen any cases of children being sick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSpecific claims around COVID-19 information that intends to manipulate people into certain behavior for the gain of a third party with a call to action within the claim, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoronavirus is a fraud and not real - go out and patronize your local bar!!\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe news about washing your hands is propaganda for soap companies, stop washing your hands\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nSpecific and unverified claims that incite people to action and cause widespread panic, social unrest or large-scale disorder, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for 2 months - run to the grocery store ASAP and buy everything!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSpecific and unverified claims made by people impersonating a government or health official or organization such as a parody account of an Italian health official stating that the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarantine is over.\nPropagating false or misleading information around COVID-19 diagnostic criteria or procedures such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, you do not have coronavirus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nFalse or misleading claims on how to differentiate between COVID-19 and a different disease, and if that information attempts to definitively diagnose someone, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you have a wet cough, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not coronavirus - but a dry cough is\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll feel like you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re drowning in snot if you have coronavirus - it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a normal runny nose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nClaims that specific groups, nationalities are never susceptible to COVID-19, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpeople with dark skin are immune to COVID-19 due to melanin production\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009creading the Quran will make an individual immune to COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nClaims that specific groups, nationalities are more susceptible to COVID-19, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009cavoid businesses owned by Chinese people as they are more likely to have COVID-19.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0\nBuilding systems that enable our team to continue to enforce our rules remotely around the world. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also increasing our employee assistance and wellness support for everyone involved in this critical work, and ensuring people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privacy and security stay a top priority.\u00c2\u00a0\nInstituting a global content severity triage system so we are prioritizing the potential rule violations that present the biggest risk of harm and reducing the burden on people to report them.\nExecuting daily quality assurance checks on our content enforcement processes to ensure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re agile in responding to this rapidly evolving, global disease outbreak.\nEngaging with our partners around the world to ensure escalation paths remain open and urgent cases can be brought to our attention.\nContinuing to review\u00c2\u00a0the Twitter Rules in the context of COVID-19 and considering ways in which they may need to evolve to account for new behaviors.\nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said on many occasions, our approach to protecting the public conversation is never static. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly relevant in these unprecedented times.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about understanding the unique role your brand plays in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lives, how that has changed, and how your brand can help or be useful during this crisis. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also about looking for opportunities to lead by example, and do the right thing, where it makes sense for your business.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nKeep up to date with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.\u00c2\u00a0\nThings are changing fast, what might have felt like a good message yesterday might not be the right thing today. Keep a close eye on the news and conversation, and be sure to consider the context before replying or broadcasting. And note, sometimes it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better not to say anything at all. \nWhen using Twitter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice we have a prompt in place which directs people searching for Coronavirus content to accurate information from the relevant local bodies (e.g. CDC ). This is running in 64 countries and in 20 languages. We are also pushing the most important content to the top of our search results and in your home timelines.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBe thoughtful about tone of voice.\u00c2\u00a0\nJust like people, brands should evolve their tone depending on the context. Right now might not be the best time to be snarky or sarcastic, while empathy, understanding and even certain types of humour may go a long way.\nOne of the most shared COVID-19 related Tweets, speaks well to the importance of tone, as Kumail Nanjiani reminds people to think of others who may be more vulnerable to this virus. How do you get this right? The best way is by listening to what people, and your customers, are saying \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and reflecting that in your copy and tone appropriately. \nAnticipate changes in your customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behaviour.\nAs people are potentially asked to self-isolate, or stay home, there will be a number of behaviour changes that might impact their needs as well as how they interact with your business.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen the release of James Bond pushed back from April to November, in an effort to avoid a major global release when people are social distancing. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen airlines offer flexible tickets, at no added cost, to reflect the realities of travel right now.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThere are other consumer behaviour changes we can anticipate from China:\nIncreased shift to e-commerce. For retail brands, get ahead of this by ensuring you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re prepared to support the changing customer needs and connection points.\nSignificant boom in live-streaming. As events were cancelled and retail stores were closed in China, people and businesses took to live-streaming. Knowing this may happen elsewhere, think about how going live could help you extend planned live events (without attendees present), or connect with your customers.\u00c2\u00a0Check out Twitter Media to learn more about how our live brand studio can help.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat might people need right now?\nBelow are the types of things we see people seek out in times of crisis, and might be especially relevant right now. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not saying you should do any or all of this, but these are some need states that you might want to think about. \nAccurate & Reliable Information.\nIn times of crises, people want credible information. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen that verified people on Twitter are about 2.4x more likely to participate in COVID-19 conversation than non-verified people, and 75% of COVID-19 related Tweets are actually Retweets. In other words, the primary method of sharing information during a time of crisis is through Retweeting.\nIf you have useful and reliable information that might help people navigate the uncertainty, or keep people calm, you should share it. For example, retail/e-commerce brands can keep the public updated on stock to help mitigate panic buying. If you have important information that affects your company, or your employees (e.g. around transmission of the virus), you may want to consider sharing that publicly.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhen it comes to setting policies and supporting your employees through this uncertain period, there is truly an opportunity to lead by example and get others to follow in your steps.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCustomer Service & Support.\nInevitably, some brands are immediately more impacted by COVID-19, due to the nature of their business. Travel (Airline/Cruises/Hospitality/Tourism) and Finance Institutions are seeing the strongest associations with COVID-19 so far.  \nIf COVID-19 is directly affecting your business and your customers, use Twitter to interact 1:1 with your customers and support them, and to broadcast any initiatives you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching that widely address the issue.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to listen and understand the concerns your customers have and to address them, as best you can. Demonstrating you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing your best in uncertain times, can go a long way. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not directly affected, but have something meaningful to offer (that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true to your brand), consider sharing. For example, health/wellbeing tips, meditation/calming content.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nDistraction & Levity.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn times like this, when the newscycle can be overwhelming, a bit of light distraction and entertainment can go a long way.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0The reality is that the average Twitter timeline is a mix of news, information and interests. In fact, since January 1st, COVID-19 related Tweets only represent 1% of total Tweets that have been sent on Twitter. \nIn other words, people on Twitter are switching between updates on COVID-19, while following elections, news, sports, TV & entertainment, and everyday lols. So long as you are thoughtful with copy and tone, you can contribute, and remember it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to stay in your lane and be true to your brand than to associate with the virus. \nCommunity & Positivity.\nAs humans, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re programmed to seek out connection. While social distancing measures offer protection and security, they come with significant impact on individuals, communities and the world at large. In the face of home quarantining, we witnessed beautiful moments of connection emerge from China, showing the importance of positivity and connection right now. \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen non-COVID-19 related positive stories capture people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention, because good things continue to happen, despite the context right now. Brands should continue to connect with and celebrate these moments, as and when appropriate. This could apply to events, trends and occasions from #IWD2020 to sports, TV premieres and culture.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat is Twitter's policy for ad campaigns related to COVID-19?\nTwitter permits explicit or implicit reference to COVID-19 only if the campaign is related to adjustments to business practices, and/or support for their customers and employees in the wake of COVID-19. Note that this policy only applies to managed advertisers; self serve advertisers are still prohibited from including any references to COVID-19. Twitter also prohibits the targeting of keywords related to COVID-19, with no exceptions.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter permits Public Service Announcements (PSA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) from government and supranational entities, news outlets that currently hold a political content exemption certification, and some vetted organizations who have a current partnership with the Twitter Policy team.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you are thinking of running a campaign prompted by, or related to COVID-19, we recommend you read Twitter Ads policies, specifically the Inappropriate Content Policy, before building any advertising campaigns.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo get you started on how to communicate during this time, here are a few questions to ask yourself:\u00c2\u00a0Can you share positive stories that might uplift the people who connect with your brand on Twitter? Do you have positive initiatives that you can talk about? Can you bring your community on Twitter together, in a positive way?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nbrands\nbranding\ncrisis response\nmarketing\nCOVID-19\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

Without Tweeps, there is no Twitter. Like many company all-hands, #OneTeam was an opportunity to come together, connect, and align around our strategic priorities. Because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Twitter, it was so much more. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take our word for it, check out this thread from a Tweep who was there:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhy Houston? We saw an opportunity to have a real-world connection with a city that has been at the center of some incredible conversations on our service \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like during #HurricaneHarvey. Twitter empowered first responders and community volunteers to come to the aid of stranded residents as flood waters rose. #OneTeam enabled us to make even deeper investments in the Houston community.\nOur central organizing principle: \u00e2\u0080\u009cpurpose before profit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an acknowledgement that by focusing on our mission and our customers, we will unlock long-term durable impact and opportunity. Over the course of three days, we deeply explored what it means to truly serve the public conversation and directly heard from our global customers about the role our service plays in their lives\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093and the world.\nWe also meditated, volunteered across 49 local nonprofits, and shared an inspirational new vision for the future of diversity and inclusion at Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur vision for the future We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a journey to be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most diverse and inclusive tech company. We used the start of a new decade to lay down a roadmap of what it will take to get there.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur efforts were informed by the appreciation that there is no other company whose product plays the role in the world that ours does. That means the stakes are incredibly high and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the luxury of time or incrementalism. We have a unique responsibility to be bold, move fast\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093and get this right.\nWe started with two questions: 1) What would it take to realize this vision? and 2) How long would it take to get there? We studied our peers in tech, evaluated industry benchmarks, and took a close look within the company. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where our work led us:\nWhile women currently make up 42.5% of our workforce, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committing that by 2025, at least half of our global workforce will be women. We want women to be represented across our global business, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also set targets for representation across technical roles (42%) and leadership (41%).\nThis is an ambitious goal and timeline, but one we can and must achieve together.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also setting bold new targets for the United States, where the federal government allows for more categorization of our workforce. By 2025, our commitment is that at least a quarter of our US workforce to be under-represented minorities; specifically Black, Latinx, Native American, Alaskan or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or Multiracial. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re currently at 14.8%. And, for the first time later this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll publicly report our progress on workforce representation of military veterans, LGBTQ people, and people with disabilities. These efforts reflect the more inclusive approach we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking in cultivating a truly diverse US workforce.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhy set targets? We set goals for things that are important\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093and diversity and inclusion has never been more important at Twitter. While goal setting has been a point of controversy in diversity and inclusion, we know representation targets work, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it in action.\nThe introduction of workforce representation targets were a catalyst to increased investment, organizational alignment, transparency and accountability. Most importantly, they helped drive progress: Since workforce representation targets were introduced in 2018, our global representation of women has increased 4.1 percentage points, and in the United States representation of Black and Latinx Tweeps has increased by 2.4 percentage points and 1.5 percentage points, respectively. During the same period, Twitter was expanding rapidly, making this growth especially meaningful.\nOur journey together The path forward involves everyone. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doubling down on investments that reach Tweeps around the world. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching an Inclusive Hiring Program to drive global progress in workforce representation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leveraging the momentum from investments in our global Business Resource Groups to introduce an Allyship Program with the goal of bringing our BRGs closer to the business and drive belonging. And, our Supplier Inclusion Program is expanding its focus to include more communities and regions.\u00c2\u00a0\nOver the next three quarters, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use this forum to share insights and take a closer look at specific initiatives that are helping us break new ground, while providing quarterly updates on our numbers here. At year end, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share a comprehensive report on all the activities that contributed to our progress in 2020.\u00c2\u00a0\nRadical transparency drives accountability\u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093to each other and all of you. We encourage you to follow our progress and let us know what you think. What do you want to hear from us in the year ahead?\nWe look forward to the ongoing conversation, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all in this together #UntilWeAllBelong.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n*Data Notes: All data is based on employee self-identification.

With world leaders, advocates, journalists, academics, and nonprofits on the service, we seek to empower conversations that are influential and leave a lasting impact on society. It is a company priority to increase the health, openness, and civility of this uniquely open conversation.\nIn a New Zealand first through our #DataforGood program, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re announcing a partnership with the University of Otago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies (@NCPACS). Our shared goal is to use Twitter data to study the ways online conversations can be used to promote tolerance and inclusion instead of division and exclusion. The initiative will be led by Emeritus Professor Kevin Clements (@kpclements) and lead researcher Sanjana Hattotuwa (@sanjanah).\nNCPACS was established in 2009 as New Zealand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first Centre to combine global interdisciplinary expertise on the issues of development, peace-building, and conflict transformation. Located within the University of Otago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (@otago) Division of Humanities, it has since made significant contributions to emergent research areas and holds regular conferences promoting research and intercommunity dialogue.\nIn the aftermath of the horrific Christchurch terror attacks on 15 March 2019, Twitter and NCPACS embarked on a joint research project aimed at analysing the ways in which Twitter and social media more broadly was used for both positive and negative purposes.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe project is a wonderful example of the way in which Twitter is working with governments, other companies and organisations, to ensure that its service is not abused by those promoting polarisation, hate language, and violence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Emeritus Professor Kevin Clements, former Foundation Chair of Peace and Conflict Studies, Founding Director of the NCPACS, and Secretary General of the International Peace Research Association.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile the initial prompt for this joint research project came from the 15 March 2019 Christchurch massacre, there have been numerous examples of digitally amplified polarisation around the world. The challenge is how to understand the ways in which social media can be used to promote tolerance and inclusion instead of division and exclusion.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnder the aegis of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global #DataforGood initiative, NCPACS received a data grant that enables our Centre and our dedicated researchers to explore in depth the events, conversations, and topics on Twitter with the hope and expectation that our work may inform strong policy outcomes, inspire others who are tackling similar issues around the world, and promote the place and role for new partnerships as we work together to solve the rapidly evolving challenges of polarised communities and identities offline and online.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nLead researcher and Ph.D. candidate at the NCPACS, Sanjana Hattotuwa, has extensive experience living in and responding to violent conflict and has made\u00c2\u00a0 significant studies of social media to determine how online communications activate positive and negative responses from a wider public. He has done this work in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and after the Christchurch massacre in 2019, in New Zealand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis research is extremely important in helping us understand the ways in which narratives are produced, promoted and engaged with to generate or stymie altruistic behaviour,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr Hattotuwa explained.\u00c2\u00a0\nMr. Hattotuwa conducted preliminary research just a week after the Christchurch massacre. By using data generated from tens of thousands of public Tweets anchored to the violence, he discovered a local and global outpouring of support for victims, solidarity with the citizens of New Zealand, the affirmation of democratic ideals, pushback against terrorism, and unequivocal condemnation of the perpetrator.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was surprised by the volume of Tweets with just five hashtags (#christchurchmosqueshooting, #christchurchshooting, #christchurchterroristattack, #newzealandterroristattack and #christchurch) generating around 85,000 Tweets in the immediate 24-hour period after the attack.\u00c2\u00a0 Another two hashtags pegged to the number of victims at the time (#49lives) and a message of solidarity (#theyareus) emerged the day after, generating 37,000 more Tweets.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn Urdu and Hindi, from Pakistan to India, as well as the New Zealand Prime Minister\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own responses on Twitter in English, the most viral Tweets at the time featured content and conversations condemning the massacre\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Mr. Hattotuwa. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Tweet by Prime Minister Jacinda Arden (@jacindaardern) was liked over 135,000 times and Retweeted over 38,000 times just five days after the massacre.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe are optimistic the research will not only demonstrate key dynamics of different communication patterns prior to the Christchurch massacre, but will also enable us to better understand ways in which differences get turned into polarised, and ultimately, toxic divisions.

Our goal is to harness the unique power of our service by providing data that empowers research, and hopefully gain a better understanding of the risks and the opportunities available through fostering an open, public conversation.

In tandem, our entire company is stepping up its internal and external efforts to build partnerships, protect the public conversation, help people find authoritative health information, raise relief funds, and contribute pro bono advertising support to ensure people are getting the right message, from the right source.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith a critical mass of expert organizations, official government accounts, health professionals, and epidemiologists on our service, our goal is to elevate and amplify authoritative health information as far as possible.\nGlobal expansion of the Covid-19 search prompt\u00c2\u00a0 Launched six days before the official designation of the virus in January, we continue to expand our dedicated search prompt feature to ensure that when you come to the service for information about Covid-19, you are met with credible, authoritative content at the top of your search experience. We have been consistently monitoring the conversation on the service to make sure keywords \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including common misspellings \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also generate the search prompt.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn each country where we have launched the initiative, we have partnered with the national public health agency or the World Health Organization (@WHO) directly. The proactive search prompt is in place with official local partnerships in over 70 countries around the world.\nThey include:\u00c2\u00a0Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Laos, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Paraguay, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Vietnam, and Yemen.\nProtecting the conversation The power of a uniquely open service during a public health emergency is clear. The speed and borderless nature of Twitter presents an extraordinary opportunity to get the word out and ensure people have access to the latest information from expert sources around the world.\nTo support that mission, our global Trust & Safety team is continuing its zero-tolerance approach to platform manipulation and any other attempts to abuse our service at this critical juncture. At present, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not seeing significant coordinated platform manipulation efforts around these issues. However, we will remain vigilant and have invested substantially in our proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviors. As ever, we also welcome constructive and open information sharing from governments and academics to further our work in these areas \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in this together.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe have also ensured the Events feature contains credible information about Covid-19 and is available at the top of the home timeline for everyone in Japan, South Korea, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Egypt,\u00c2\u00a0France,\u00c2\u00a0Germany, India, Ireland,\u00c2\u00a0Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the UAE, the UK and the US.\n#AdsForGood support & additional protections Based on our Inappropriate Content Policy, we will halt any attempt by advertisers to opportunistically use the Covid-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads. Government entities that want to disseminate public health information will be permitted to promote ads on Covid-19. In the case of Covid-19, we have put additional safeguards into place in order to facilitate the sharing of trusted public health information and to reduce potential harm to users. We are currently prohibiting the promotion of all medical masks\u00c2\u00a0and alcohol hand sanitizers due to strong correlation to Covid-19 and instances of inflated prices globally.\nIn addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committing Ads for Good credits to nonprofit organizations to ensure they can build campaigns to fact-check and get reputable health information to the widest possible audiences. For example, as part of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN/@factchecknet), we have supported the Spanish organization @maldita_es and @malditobulo, which focuses on mitigating the impact of disinformation on public discourse through fact-checking and data journalism techniques. In Asia, we have partnered with the Taiwan Fact Checking Center (@taiwantfc), which has been using Twitter to connect with IFCN fact checkers around the world via #CoronavirusFacts. They are working in real-time to find credible information and debunk rumors in Chinese.\nFurthering our partnerships\u00c2\u00a0 Our Global Public Policy team has open lines of communication with relevant multinational stakeholders, including the World Health Organization, numerous global government and public health organizations, and officials around the world, to ensure they can troubleshoot account issues, get their experts verified, and seek strategic counsel as they use the power of Twitter to mitigate harm.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also in close contact with our industry peers and will attend all relevant cross-functional meetings. As a uniquely open service, our data is being used in research every day and our researchers hub is publicly available. We welcome applications for the use of Twitter data to support research on Covid-19. We will also explore further #DataForGood partnerships to assess how our data products can enhance academic and NGO understanding of public health emergencies now and into the future.\u00c2\u00a0\nPlaying our part through donation matching\u00c2\u00a0 We've set up a dedicated internal Covid-19 campaign page through our employee donation matching program to support humanitarian response and relief efforts around the world. Any Twitter employee can donate to relevant nonprofit organizations, and Twitter will match donations up to $2,000 per employee.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat can you do?\u00c2\u00a0 Looking for advice on how best to use Twitter in a time like this? Follow @WHO and your local health ministry \u00e2\u0080\u0094 seek out the authoritative health information and ignore the noise. See something suspicious or abusive, report it to us immediately. Most importantly, think before you Tweet. Through Twitter Moments, we have curated longer-form content that helps tell the full story of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening around Covid-19 globally. For educators and parents, consult our media literacy guide, which was built in partnership with @UNESCO, here.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re absolutely committed to playing our part and will continue to provide substantive updates as this situation evolves.

Goleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in-depth review of research on the human brain and human behavior led him to the conclusion that cognitive intelligence alone is not a reliable predictor of future success in life and business. Rather it is emotional intelligence that plays a major role in determining success in life.1 This (at the time) relatively new way of looking at people and success has since gained wide acceptance and EQ has become highly valued within the workplace and beyond.\nTwenty-five years later, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard not to draw parallels with a shift happening in the business world. Thanks to technology and global connectivity, cultural, language and geographic barriers to information flow and communication have all but disappeared. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great news for consumers as it means more choice than ever before. But for businesses it means competition is at an all-time high and relying on status quo business IQ \u00e2\u0080\u0093 price, product and distribution - is no longer enough.\u00c2\u00a0\nWelcome to the Relationship Economy\nWelcome to the relationship economy - where customer experiences and brand loyalty (business EQ) reign supreme. As Forrester puts it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompetitive strategy can no longer rely on strength of manufacturing, distribution, or information. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Age of Customer and Forrester\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data proves that the right Customer Experience is the only way to significantly differentiate\u00e2\u0080\u009d.2\nEmotional Intelligence and Business\nSo, what does EQ mean when it comes to business? Much like the original ideas espoused by Goleman, businesses would do well to better understand the feelings, motivations and emotions of their customers and then use that insight to guide their actions.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor their part, customers want more than a transaction. They are looking for everything you would expect from a relationship - alignment of values, trust, personalization, exceptional service and open dialogue. And, for better or worse, consumers today are less loyal and quick to switch should the relationship sour. According to the American Express 2017 Customer Service Barometer, more than half of Americans have scrapped a planned purchase or transaction because of bad service, and 33 percent say they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll consider switching companies after just a single instance of poor service.\nIf business EQ is the secret ingredient of meaningful, lasting and mutually beneficial relationships, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that businesses be attuned to their customers by gathering emotional intelligence in real-time, continuously. They need to be able to pick up signals before things turn bad or identify things that work well and do more of them. There is one place where consumers are freely sharing their emotions, unprompted, in the moment. Every minute of every day, people around the world are sharing their thoughts, experiences and opinions as they happen on Twitter. Social listening helps tap into these insights, allowing businesses to sharpen their customer EQ and act in the best interest of the relationship.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nReady to improve your business\u00e2\u0080\u0099s emotional intelligence?

This tool helps us identify and remove misinformation that could suppress turnout for events such as the US Census and elections around the globe.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor updates on this work, follow @TwitterGov and @Policy.\nUpdated on March 19, 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The search prompt expanded from English and Spanish to also include the following languages: Chinese (simplified), Vietnamese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Tagalog, Polish, French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Japanese.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Now, 16 years on, we are delighted to be working with partners all over the world to mark #SaferInternetDay2020 and play our part in shaping a better internet for all.\nOver the past 12 months, we have made substantial strides in tackling abusive content on our service globally. There will always be more to do, but we have made meaningful progress. Key highlights include:\nMore than 1 in 2 of Tweets we take action on for abuse are now proactively surfaced using technology, rather than relying on reports to Twitter - this compares to 1 in 5 tweets in 2018;\nWe have seen a 105% increase in accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules);\nIn November 2019, we launched the option globally for users to hide replies to their Tweets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 now anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets;\nIn December 2019, we expanded and diversified our Trust and Safety Council, which brings together experts and organizations from around the world to help advise us as we develop our products, programs and the Twitter Rules;\nLast Tuesday, we announced a new rule to address synthetic & manipulated media. From 5 March, we will start labeling Tweets if we believe that media shared within them have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated. Labels will link to a Twitter moment to provide additional context from reputable sources on the content in question.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMaking Twitter safer is not a job we can do alone \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so important to us, to participate in #SaferInternetDay2020. Across the world today and throughout February, we are working with our network of safety partners to amplify their guidance, provide Ads for Good grants to support their campaigns, and collaborating on what we can all do create a better Internet. We are running safety training and delivering presentations on our work across 4 continents, and participating in events globally to commemorate the day.\nIn Mexico City, we will be delivering a safety training for the Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists. In India, we will be addressing e-Raksha: Cybercrime Against Children with the CyberPeace Foundation & UNICEF.\nAt our HQ in San Francisco, we will be conducting a safety workshop for high school students from #ICANHELP (@icanhelp), and partnering with Common Sense (@commonsense) to deliver digital citizenship training to various nonprofits serving youth and families. We will also be opening our event space to 50 Digital Learning facilitators from San Francisco Unified School District (@SFUSDdot), and sharing Twitter educator and safety best practices.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere in Europe, we will be running a training at the Helsinki Central Library Oodi; participating in Better Internet for Kids meeting organised by the European Commission in Brussels, and running an event to promote a safer internet for all citizens, especially young people, with our partners Webwise at our international HQ in Dublin.\nIn the UK - working with @ArtHouse, we created four short videos about the range of safety tools available on Twitter, with 4 online leaders; Habiba da Silva,\u00c2\u00a0Dina Tokio,\u00c2\u00a0Hannah Witton,\u00c2\u00a0Alexander Leon. Our aim is to reach a wider audience with engaging content about these individuals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own experiences on the service, and the safety tools they use.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are encouraging conversations with a special emoji for the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2020, available in eighteen languages to encourage conversations around a safer internet.\nThroughout 2020, we will continue to support our safety partners, and work to ensure the public conversation on Twitter is healthy, open, and safe.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nprivacy\nsafety\ntechnology\nsocial listening\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\nTwitter reveals first ever Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s World Cup #GoldenTweet award winners\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 16 July 2019\n          \nInsights into the 2019 #FIFAWWC conversation on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 8 July 2019\n          \nWhat to expect from Twitter ahead of the first #DemDebate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 26 June 2019\n          \nHow #E32019 played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 18 June 2019\n          "}

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we announced our plan last fall to once again seek input from around the globe on how we will address synthetic and manipulated media. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing what we learned and how it shaped the update to The Twitter Rules, how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll treat this content when we identify it, as well as something new you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in Twitter as part of this change.\nWhat did we learn? Through a survey on our initial draft of this rule, as well as Tweets that included the hashtag #TwitterPolicyFeedback, we gathered more than 6,500 responses from people around the world. We also consulted with a diverse, global group of civil society and academic experts on our draft approach. Overall, people recognize the threat that misleading altered media poses and want Twitter to do something about it. Here are some of the top-line findings:\nTwitter should give me more information: Globally, more than 70 percent of people who use Twitter said \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking no action\u00e2\u0080\u009d on misleading altered media would be unacceptable. Respondents were nearly unanimous in their support for Twitter providing additional information or context on Tweets that have this type of media.\nThis type of content should be labeled: Nearly 9 out of 10 individuals said placing warning labels next to significantly altered content would be acceptable. That is about as many who said it would be acceptable to alert people before they Tweet misleading altered media.  Compared to placing warning labels, respondents were somewhat less supportive of removing or hiding Tweets that contained misleading altered media. For example, 55 percent of those surveyed in the US said it would be acceptable to remove all of such media. When asked to give their open-ended thoughts about the proposed rule, people who opposed removal of all altered media talked about the impact on free expression and censorship.\nIf it is likely to cause harm, it should be removed: More than 90 percent of people who shared feedback support Twitter removing this content when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that it is intended to cause certain types of harm.\nThere should be enforcement action when sharing this content: More than 75 percent of people believe accounts that share misleading altered media should face enforcement action. Enforcement actions could include people on Twitter having to delete their Tweet or having their account suspended.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the new rule? You may not deceptively share synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm. In addition, we may label Tweets containing synthetic and manipulated media to help people understand the media\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authenticity and to provide additional context.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use the following criteria to consider Tweets and media for labeling or removal under this rule:\nAre the media synthetic or manipulated?  In determining whether media have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, some factors we consider include:\u00c2\u00a0  \u00e2\u0080\u0094Whether the content has been substantially edited in a manner that fundamentally alters its composition, sequence, timing, or framing; \u00e2\u0080\u0094Any visual or auditory information (such as new video frames, overdubbed audio, or modified subtitles) that has been added or removed; and \u00e2\u0080\u0094Whether media depicting a real person has been fabricated or simulated. \nAre the media shared in a deceptive manner?   We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also consider whether the context in which media are shared could result in confusion or misunderstanding or suggests a deliberate intent to deceive people about the nature or origin of the content, for example by falsely claiming that it depicts reality.  We also assess the context provided alongside media, for example:  \u00e2\u0080\u0094The text of the Tweet accompanying or within the media \u00e2\u0080\u0094Metadata associated with the media\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u0094Information on the profile of the person sharing the media \u00e2\u0080\u0094Websites linked in the profile of the person sharing the media, or in the Tweet sharing the media\nIs the content likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm?   Tweets that share synthetic and manipulated media are subject to removal under this policy if they are likely to cause harm. Some specific harms we consider include:  \u00e2\u0080\u0094Threats to the physical safety of a person or group \u00e2\u0080\u0094Risk of mass violence or widespread civil unrest \u00e2\u0080\u0094Threats to the privacy or ability of a person or group to freely express themselves or participate in civic events, such as: stalking or unwanted and obsessive attention;targeted content that includes tropes, epithets, or material that aims to silence someone; voter suppression or intimidation\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat will this look like on Twitter? If we believe that media shared in a Tweet have been significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated, we will provide additional context on the Tweet. This means we may:\nApply a label to the Tweet; \nShow a warning to people before they Retweet or like the Tweet;\nReduce the visibility of the Tweet on Twitter and/or prevent it from being recommended; and/or\nProvide additional explanations or clarifications, as available, such as a landing page with more context.\nIn most cases, we will take all of the above actions on Tweets we label.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur teams will start labeling Tweets with this type of media on March 5, 2020.\nThis will be a challenge and we will make errors along the way \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we appreciate the patience. However, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to doing this right. Updating our rules in public and with democratic participation will continue to be core to our approach. \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to serve the public conversation, and doing our work openly and with the people who use our service.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@TwitterSafety\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

So, we want to provide some background on how specific Topics are selected, the process to find the best Tweets for you about these Topics, and how we seek to highlight healthy conversations.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow Topics are chosen\nRight now, there are roughly 1,000 Topics you can follow via the Topic browser, which will then show you Tweets about those Topics in your Home timeline. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding new Topics almost every week. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Prompt within Twitter showing you how to follow Topics. \u00a0\n          \n          \n        \n          \n            Some Topics you can follow.\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nWe add new Topics based on the volume and health of conversations happening on Twitter. We start by looking at the volume of conversation on Twitter: how much people are Tweeting, Retweeting, replying, and liking Tweets about that Topic. The more conversation, the more likely it will be evaluated for inclusion in our next batch of available Topics. Topics reflect the broader, lasting conversations people have about the events, people, and things they discuss. Once we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve identified a new Topic, we then shift our focus to identifying the most relevant Tweets.\u00c2\u00a0\nFinding the most relevant Tweets on a Topic\nTo find the full set of Tweets about a Topic, we use a combination of methods including looking at the text of Tweets as well as signals generated by machine learning solutions highlighting what Tweets might be about. At times, our teams and external partners may also help source accounts to be included in certain Topics.\nTo find the most relevant Tweets, we start by identifying the people on Twitter who are most interested in a given Topic using using a combination of machine learning, curation, and keywords.* This could mean they Tweet a lot about the Topic or interact a lot with Tweets about the Topic. From there, we find the Tweets that are most interesting to those people, using additional algorithms that look at many signals from those fan accounts including what types of content they engage with or specific accounts that are most relevant. Our systems check to confirm these Tweets are relevant to the Topic by looking at a series of related keywords.\nKeeping Topics healthy\nA healthy conversation about Topics is one where you want and feel safe to participate. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve implemented a number of protections so that the conversations included in a Topic should be healthy and free from abuse. This includes working to not recommend Tweets for a Topic if the engagement is manipulated or spammy. We look at a number of underlying signals, including how others interact with both the Tweet and the author \u00e2\u0080\u0094 things like reports, blocks, and whether people have dismissed similar recommendations by clicking \u00e2\u0080\u009cshow less often\u00e2\u0080\u009d or muting closely-related keywords. These are just some of the signals we use when ranking and filtering the group of Tweets until we have a set we are confident recommending for that Topic. And, to be clear: Tweets that criticize, satirize, or disagree within a Topic are a natural part of a healthy conversation and are eligible for inclusion. These protections are on top of all of the health protections we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already put in place for other parts of Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn addition to the processes described above, there are quality assurance checks with a globally distributed team of people to confirm Topics are accurately highlighting relevant and healthy conversations. If Topics are unfollowed frequently or Tweets within Topics are reported often, these could be signals that those Topic Tweets might not be pertinent and healthy. If this is happening, we may pause the Topic temporarily.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe know people are trusting us by following Topics and that Topics offer additional amplification to Tweets, so we want to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re amplifying relevant, healthy conversations.\u00c2\u00a0\nPersonalizing the Topic for you\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen you follow a Topic, the Tweets you see about that Topic in your timeline are personalized. Your past activity \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like your Tweets and Tweets you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve liked, replied to, or Retweeted \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are used to identify the Tweets you'll find most interesting. Also, if you engage more with one Topic, like Dogs, versus another Topic, like cats, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you more of the Dog Topic. (Sorry cat lovers!)\u00c2\u00a0\nTo wrap it up, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use one of my favorite Topics, BLACKPINK, as an example. For the BLACKPINK Topic, accounts regularly Tweeting about and engaging with the KPOP band generally or a specific band member, like a fan account, are found. From there, Tweets that would be interesting to those fan accounts are gathered using the method described above. Throughout this process, our systems are at work ensuring we are surfacing the conversations you want to see.\nFrom that narrowed pool, depending on what might be most interesting to you, say which band member you Tweet about or reply to Tweets about the most, you may see a Tweet about Lisa or Jennie.\nAfter all that, the best BLACKPINK Topic Tweet for you is ready to be shown in your Home timeline!\nThis is just the start, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep working to improve Topics. We hope you like it. \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u008d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see a Topic you want to follow yet, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding new Topics almost every week. Topics are available in English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic, and Korean.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear how you are liking Topics. Do the Topics you follow show interesting Tweets? When you follow a Topic, do you see too many or too few related Tweets? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep tweaking our systems to make Topics better.

Magic and spiritual consultation has been replaced with statistical models and data. Mathematicians and data experts are applying methods such as regression analysis, decision trees and neural networks to calculate probable future events and behaviour across consumer, social and scientific spheres. Given the amount of interest and investment being put into prediction, our hunger to know the future clearly hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t waned.\nUsing Social Prediction for Consumer Trend Forecasting\u00c2\u00a0\nWith respect to business, our obsession with prediction makes sense. In today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constantly accelerating hyper-competitive environment it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been more crucial to be the first mover. Consider the competitive world of consumer products. Between 2013 and 2018, $20B in sales was lost by large and midsize U.S. CPGs to small and private-label brands. These small, nimble challengers proved adept at identifying and capitalizing on new and emerging consumer trends and being first to market with innovative new products.\nPut simply, in the business world those who can best predict the future will win. But where to start? Social data and social prediction may hold the key.\nPredicting Trends Using Twitter Data\nTwitter is often thought of as the place where news breaks first, where the news gets its news. And while that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely correct, what is less appreciated about Twitter is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the place to see and understand the trends that are shaping society. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always thought of it as the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group, where people share their experiences on anything and everything. And while some of these insights might be quite mundane, in the aggregate they allow us to understand human behaviours, moods and mindsets. They reveal taste preferences, friction and frustration with products or services and desires for unarticulated needs.\nAnd when you combine 14 years of these insights (Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age) with predictive modelling techniques, you can turn trendspotting from an ad-hoc and subjective art form into a more systematic, data-driven capability. Used and applied correctly it changes your company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer intelligence competency from a focus on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happened, to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen and how do we take advantage?\nPredictive Social Analytics Reveals Consumer Food Trends\nThis is an emerging space to be sure, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already seeing some impressive results.\u00c2\u00a0 Take Black Swan, for example, a data science and technology company specializing in social prediction. Using Natural Language Processing technology, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built data sets based on social media conversations surrounding specific product categories. These datasets allow them to identify, size and forecast the future importance of every topic of conversation that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being talked about by consumers; from macro-level drivers like sustainability to specific trend manifestations like a trending ingredient.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, Black Swan says they can predict how popular Bakuchiol \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the plant-based vegan alternative to retinol \u00e2\u0080\u0093 will be in 6,12, or 18 months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time versus other trendy ingredients in the skincare category.\nAccording to Black Swan, their clients such as PepsiCo and other global brands are using these trend predictions to improve the velocity and throughput of their innovation programs, accelerating time to market while also helping to prioritize their corporate development and acquisition efforts. A great example is PepsiCo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Global Insights team, who have been using Black Swan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social prediction software to fast-track their new product ideation process. As new concepts and ideas are conceived in a workshop environment they are instantly validated against the latest trend data and predictions in an iterative process. The result: several new product concepts for their snacking portfolio were optimised and validated in just four hours, a process that traditionally took them at least four weeks!\nWhen it comes to tapping into emerging trends and accelerating innovation, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to see how prediction can be a game-changer.\u00c2\u00a0\nNeed a resolution for 2020? Why not put aside oracles and crystal balls for good and look to Twitter for inspiration? I predict it will be the best decision you make all year.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\n@TwitterBusiness\n@TwitterSafety\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsocial listening\nsocialdata\nsocial media\nsocial intelligence\nprediction\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          \nWhy business IQ is not enough in the era of the relationship economy\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 14 February 2020\n          \nThe state of social intelligence: 2019 year in review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 December 2019\n          "}

The Explore tab, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collection of trending topics and hashtags, is where people go to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, making it a prime location for advertisers to connect with people and conversation.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLaunching a new streaming service \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s called Disney+ \u00e2\u0080\u0093 requires breaking through and becoming a part of the cultural conversation. We knew social platforms, including Twitter, would be playing a key role. We leveraged the Promoted Trend Spotlight throughout our campaign as it was important for us to truly capture people's attention at scale.\nTrevor Kelley\nVice President, Digital Marketing, Disney+ \nWe are now making Promoted Trend Spotlight generally available in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, and expanding the product to 12 additional markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, and Thailand.\u00c2\u00a0\nHow it works:\nAs a complement to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Promoted Trend takeover product, Promoted Trend Spotlight supports 6-second videos and GIFs, as well as static images. Creative displays on mobile and desktop, with the ad running edge-to-edge on mobile.\nYour ad will appear at the top of the Explore tab for the first two visits per person, per day.\nAfter the initial two visits, the placement moves to the standard Promoted Trend placement and organic editorial content resurfaces in the Spotlight placement.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nIn an eye-tracking study conducted by EyeSee, a global behavioral research company, people spent 26% more time looking at the Promoted Trend Spotlight as compared to the standard Promoted Trend unit. These longer dwell times generated impact throughout the funnel: from +113% higher ad recall and +18% higher brand consideration to +67% lift in stated likelihood to use a brand in the future. In addition, according to internal Twitter data, people were three times more likely to click through an ad in the Spotlight unit than the standard Promoted Trend.\nKey features:\nCaptures attention: With immersive, full-width creative, Promoted Trend Spotlight captures attention and reinforces your message.\nDifferentiates your brand: Sitting atop the Explore tab, Promoted Trend Spotlight differentiates your brand from other placements on Twitter by appearing next to highly curated editorial content.\nSurfaces conversation: Tying together the prominent placement and expansive coverage atop Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Explore tab, brands have the opportunity to generate conversation and invite discussion.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFor more information on Promoted Trend Spotlight and to confirm availability and pricing, please contact your Twitter Client Partner.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nvideo\nads\nbrands\nproduct\nmarketing\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          \nIntroducing Twitter ArtHouse, helping brands create and optimize content\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 10 July 2019\n          \nResolution on Android update\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 December 2016\n          "}

This applies to the distribution of false or misleading information about the electoral process or when or how to vote. We also have policies to address other behaviours that can appear during elections such as platform manipulation and spam (including fake accounts), and the distribution of hacked materials. \nOur policies prohibit news media entities controlled by state authorities from purchasing advertisements on Twitter. We also recently announced a ban on all political advertising globally on Twitter. We made this decision based on our belief that political message reach should be earned, not bought.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTraining political partners on using Twitter and our reporting channels During elections, we work closely with political parties from across the political spectrum to train them on using Twitter to best engage with their constituents.

This lets us tackle attempts to manipulate conversations rapidly, across languages and time zones, without relying on reactive reports - often before accounts have even issued their first Tweet.\nWe continue to make strong progress and in the first half of 2019, challenged almost 100 million accounts.

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we routinely disclose datasets of information operations we can reliably link to state actors.\u00c2\u00a0 \nThese datasets live in our public archive of state-backed information operations \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the largest of its kind in the industry. First launched in October 2018, the archive has been accessed by thousands of researchers from around the world, who in turn have conducted independent, third-party investigations of their own.\nState-backed information operations originating in Saudi Arabia\nToday, we are sharing comprehensive data about 5,929 accounts which we have removed for violating our platform manipulation policies. Rigorous investigations by our Site Integrity team have allowed us to attribute these accounts to a significant state-backed information operation on Twitter originating in Saudi Arabia.\u00c2\u00a0\nThese accounts represent the core portion of a larger network of more than 88,000 accounts engaged in spammy behaviour across a wide range of topics. We have permanently suspended all of these accounts from the service. In order to protect the privacy of potentially compromised accounts repurposed to engage in platform manipulation, and in response to researcher feedback requesting that we pre-filter unrelated spam, we have not disclosed data for all 88,000 accounts. In the interest of offering meaningful transparency, the dataset we are disclosing includes a representative, random sample of the fake and spammy accounts associated with this broader network.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe have also shared information about this activity with our peer companies to enable investigations of related activity on their services, and the relevant law enforcement entities.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere are some additional distinct features of the accounts we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing today:\nOur internal analysis shows the network was involved in various forms of platform manipulation, targeting discussions related to Saudi Arabia and advancing their geopolitical interests on the world stage. Primarily, accounts were amplifying messages favourable to Saudi authorities, mainly through inauthentic engagement tactics such as aggressive liking, Retweeting and replying. While the majority of the content from this network was in Arabic, a portion of it related to events relevant to Western audiences, including amplification of discussion around sanctions in Iran and appearances by Saudi government officials in Western media.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nOur investigations have traced the source of the coordinated activity to Smaat, a social media marketing and management company based in Saudi Arabia. Our in-house technical indicators show that Smaat appears to have created, purchased, and/or managed these accounts on behalf of \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but not necessarily with the knowledge of \u00e2\u0080\u0094 their clients. We have permanently suspended Smaat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s access to our service as a result, as well as the Twitter accounts of Smaat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior executives. Smaat managed a range of Twitter accounts for high-profile individuals, as well as many government departments in Saudi Arabia.\u00c2\u00a0\nMany of the accounts involved in the overall network employed third-party automated tools in order to amplify non-political content at high volumes. As a general matter, the use of automation to Tweet helpful content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 like crisis response info or weather updates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is not a violation of our rules. However, this behaviour was, in part, strategically employed in an attempt to mask the overall platform manipulation originating from these accounts. These tactics made it more difficult for observers to identify political Tweets in the timelines of accounts, which mostly shared automated, non-political content.\u00c2\u00a0\n What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next \nWe exist to serve the public conversation around the world. To this end, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to take strong enforcement action against any state-backed information campaigns which undermine our company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission, principles, and policies.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor more information on the processes and principles behind this work, see here.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\nhealth\npolicy\nsecurity\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          "}

But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when you start putting that social data to work to make better decisions, that you know that you have moved from social media management to social intelligence. That transition has been the focus of many conversations I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had with businesses during the past year, including a couple of social listening roundtables we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hosted here at Twitter. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my summary of what those businesses are telling me:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSocial intelligence is on the rise\nAs previously mentioned, more companies are seeing Twitter and other social data as a valuable source of insight into the people and topics important to them. Businesses are realizing the uniqueness of social media in providing real-time, unprompted and authentic feedback and are starting to overlay this \u00e2\u0080\u0098voice of the customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099 data with other data sources to find correlation and causation.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nInsight is being \u00e2\u0080\u009cdemocratized\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nCompanies are in the midst of massive rollouts of dashboards and alerting capabilities to support the specific needs of various departments and regions. At the same time, analysis capabilities are being more centralized to support specialization and reduce duplication of effort. Social listening and analytics tools are supporting the former while business intelligence tools the latter. And to that point\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nDIY is happening\nSome innovative organizations are applying their own models for text analysis to more accurately understand all this unstructured data. For this reason, they are either connecting directly to social APIs themselves or are using their social listening provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s APIs to get social data into their business intelligence tools for further, deeper data analysis.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSmall is big\nWhen taken as a whole, the sheer quantity of social data points can be impressive but quantity is not necessarily a requirement for success. Many companies are deriving immense value in surfacing small numbers (hundreds or even dozens) of highly relevant data points on very specific topics. For example, an analyst researching a topic such as yogurt might only find a couple of hundred mentions in a given month, but within that data set are valuable insights around flavor preferences, health benefits or usage trends.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not if, but when\nMost organizations aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t asking if social data like that from Twitter has value but when they should be utilizing it. Put another way, what questions is Twitter good at answering? How does social media data complement other data sources and/or research techniques? The answers might vary depending on industry, audience, and/or geography, but many organizations I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoken with are getting immense value from social data at the beginning of their research, using it to understand market context and quickly (and cheaply) test assumptions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNew innovators are emerging\nInnovation has primarily been driven by social listening vendors over the past decade, however, we are starting to see some really interesting and innovative work coming from smaller digital agencies and data science shops connecting the social dots with other data sources. As mentioned, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this blending of data sources which will prove the value of social data for new use cases.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs 2019 draws to a close and we look toward a new decade, what is the current state of social intelligence? To paraphrase Churchill, this is certainly not the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning. And this stage should excite us.

We exceeded some targets for workforce representation, but fell short of others and need to do better. \nThe momentum we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gained recruiting diverse technical talent is encouraging \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we must now extend that progress to senior roles, where more focus is needed.\nAs we approach a new decade, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to take a new approach to how we measure the diversity of our global workforce, set bold targets, and share our progress.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn the meantime, we presented this report to our Board on December 12, 2019, and because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to working in the open, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing it with you here. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe Data\nIn 2017, we set two-year diversity targets for women, Black, and Latinx representation at Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSo where are we today?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on a journey with no finish line and progress can never be fast enough. Over the last two years we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made progress \u00e2\u0080\u0094 exceeding representation targets in some areas (Black) and falling short in others (women and Latinx).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nNext year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing a new vision for what we want our workforce to look like in five years, and a career pathways program that will help increase representation of women, Black, and Latinx Tweeps across all levels, roles, and office locations. \nHiring is a critical driver of our progress. In the most recent quarter, we hired more women, Black, and Latinx talent compared to the previous quarter. However, we need to double down here to keep pace with overall hiring at the company, which has accelerated. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBelow are the attrition rates for women, Black, and Latinx talent, which continue to be at or below the company-wide attrition rate. While this is encouraging data, we are determined to lower attrition across these groups even further, and will be investing heavily in 2020.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBeyond these three demographics, we continue to track and support deeper representation across our workforce. Here are the broader breakdowns:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe true measure of diversity is more complex than what can be gathered from formal People systems. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched an anonymous internal Global Inclusion Survey to collect more robust information about our Tweeps\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lived experiences. The survey explores important topics across gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity and immigration, socio-economic status, and religion \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to name a few. This data will guide our future I&D investments and we look forward to sharing the results in a future report.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHiring\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve doubled down on our presence at industry conferences popular with talent from diverse communities. This fall, we had our strongest presence yet at AdWeek, Women Impact Tech, AdColor, National Black MBA, Grace Hopper Conference, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Conference, AfroTech, and Women in Product. Our Talent Acquisition teams continue to cultivate leads from these events with a focus on hiring interns, new grads, and senior-level talent.\nWe also made two critical hires to continue growing our I&D team.\u00c2\u00a0Preet Grewal\u00c2\u00a0(@preet_oG) is the new Head of Inclusion & Diversity for Asia Pacific who will share responsibility for Europe and Latin America and help ensure that our work maintains a truly global perspective as we scale. Donna Wright (@DJtheHRLady) is our new Head of Diversity Talent Acquisition and will lead our work to embed inclusive hiring principles throughout the hiring progress.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLearning & Development\nIn August, we rolled out a new e-learning module to help Tweeps better understand what\u00c2\u00a0 micro-aggressions are, how to avoid them, and what to do when they occur. As a complement, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken the show on the road and hosted in-person trainings for teams that want to dive deeper. \nIn November, we launched mandatory unconscious bias training for all Tweeps. These trainings equip learners to recognize and address the effects of unconscious bias by challenging assumptions; encouraging diversity of experience, opinion, and expression; and supporting a workplace culture that actively and intentionally strives to be more inclusive. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n#LoveWhereYouWork\n#TweepTour\u00c2\u00a0 \nOur leaders wrapped up their world tour of our 30+ offices with visits to our spaces in Sydney, Sacramento, Miami, San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Washington DC, and their last \u00e2\u0080\u009cstop\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 time with fully remote workers in a host of locations across the world.

Often, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a superstar or a jingle that catches your attention. But this year, the brands who are breaking through the noise are communicating heartfelt messages. Sprinklr analyzed brands who received a significant amount of buzz for their marketing this year to find the top 10 campaigns with the happiest reactions on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhy is this study important? Because emotions drive sales. Research shows that positive emotions toward a brand have a far greater influence on consumer loyalty than trust and other judgments, which are based on a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attributes. The most successful brands listen to their customers on Twitter, learn from them and take these insights to create successful marketing campaigns that elicit a positive emotional response.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSprinklr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter insights from the top 10 brands that make people happier:\u00c2\u00a0 \n1.

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been discussing internally and with the current members how we can make sure the Council best serves the people who use Twitter, and heard feedback that we needed to broaden membership to include a more diverse range of voices and organize members to have deeper conversations.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nGoing forward, the Council will be made up of several groups, each focused on advising us on important issues that contribute to real-world harm. These are difficult areas to discuss, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more important to ensure these topics have dedicated time and are understood as unique challenges in their own right. In 2020, we will initially set up groups focused on:\nSafety and online harassment\nHuman and digital rights\nChild sexual exploitation\nSuicide prevention and mental health\nThese four groups cover topics that are critical to ensuring people feel safe, and will be a crucial part in helping us learn how we can move faster to address emerging trends and risks. Focusing on these issues will help us more quickly adapt and address new trends and risks to consider. By bringing together a wider and more diverse range of perspectives, we hope to engage in more substantial discussion of these issues.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also set up temporary working groups on other topics that will be better addressed in conversation with organisations that have related expertise, including those who may not already be members of the Council. One such group will work on the issues we face as we broaden our interpretation of dehumanization.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Coming Next\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share more on how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll expand the Council to include experts from more countries and perspectives not yet represented as well as other ways we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll gather feedback from people, including details of which groups will be participating in the working groups.

The feedback and advice we receive from them makes Twitter better and safer. Expect us to communicate more of our thinking moving forward.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re grateful for the continued support and engagement from our partners around the world and look forward to collaborating with even more groups in the future.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsafety\npartnerships\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

That can range from a journalist reporting from the campaign trail, a government office providing voting resources, or a politician sharing their stance on an issue.\nWith just under a year until US Election Day and two months until the first votes are cast in the Iowa caucus, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching two initiatives that will help people find original sources of information on Twitter by clearly identifying political candidates.\nFirst, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing back Election Labels, which we first launched during the 2018 US midterm election. These labels received overwhelmingly positive feedback from voters and candidates, and they played a prominent role in election conversation: In the week before Election Day, people on Twitter saw Labeled accounts approximately 100 million times each day, and 13% of US election conversation on Twitter included a Tweet with an Election Label.\u00c2\u00a0\nSecond, starting this week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start identifying candidates who qualify for the primary ballot for US House, US Senate, and Gubernatorial races with a verified badge.\nFor both primary candidate verification and Election Labels, we are partnering with Ballotpedia, as we did in 2018, to utilize their expertise in identifying the official campaign Twitter accounts of candidates.\nWhat are Election Labels?\nElection Labels provide information about political candidates, like the office they are running for, their state and district number, and contain a small ballot box icon. The Label will appear on the profile page of a candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter account and on every Tweet sent and Retweeted by the candidate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account, even when embedded on sites off of Twitter. See below how the labels will look:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhich candidates will qualify for election labels?\nLabels will appear on the Twitter accounts of candidates running for US House of Representatives, US Senate, or Governor in the 2020 US election who have qualified for the general election ballot.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen will election labels appear?\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start seeing Labels appear on applicable candidates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Twitter accounts once the candidate has qualified for the general election ballot.

In addition, 84% of executives say that innovation is important to their growth strategy. In a one week period, Twitter logged over 100K appearances of #innovation. It feels like literally EVERYONE is talking about innovation. Electronics companies, fast food chains, insurance providers, airlines - I could go on - they all see innovation as a path forward into the future - whether that future be one of improved customer experiences, greater efficiency, increased profits, continuing relevance or all four.\u00c2\u00a0\nYet, according to Harvard professor and best-selling author Clayton Christensen, 95% of all product innovations fail. Those are daunting odds.\u00c2\u00a0\nSo, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a business to do? Many experts assert that the answer partially lies with the customer. Specifically, businesses need to identify the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d behind customer actions and choices - what need are they trying to meet when they purchase a product or service?\u00c2\u00a0 What is the context surrounding that decision? That deeper understanding of the customer will surface opportunities to innovate.\nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a customer experience (CX) professional, this should be great news. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your whole \u00e2\u0080\u009craison d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00a8tre\u00e2\u0080\u009d all about understanding the customer? The question is, how well do you really know your customers? And, to build on that, is your current customer program generating the types of insights that uncover the context critical to discovering opportunities to innovate?\nUsing social media data with traditional survey data for deeper consumer insights\nUncovering context is tough. Certainly, traditional voice of the customer (VoC) surveys have served CX professionals well by providing a high-level measurement of their customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall satisfaction as well as identifying ongoing concerns and/or gaps in customer experience. But, because surveys are by their very nature directive, i.e. the company determines the questions and the timing, not to mention they are usually completed after the customer experience in a sterile format, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unlikely to be very good at revealing the circumstances and emotions surrounding a customer interaction.\nOn Twitter, people share hundreds of millions of Tweets every day. And, at every stage of the customer journey, through their Tweets, they are signalling satisfaction, concerns, frictions, and yes, context. They are not only expressing how they feel but why they feel that way. And, thanks to\u00c2\u00a0social listening tools,\u00c2\u00a0you can easily tap into these conversations,\u00c2\u00a0uncovering insights in real-time\u00c2\u00a0as well as historical patterns. When combined with other more traditional data from sources like surveys or focus groups, that additional context provides a fuller picture of your customers, allowing your business to know them on a deeper level, uncovering hidden opportunities to innovate.\nOf the six key success factors identified in PWC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a02018 Global Innovation 1000\u00c2\u00a0study, coming in at number four is \u00e2\u0080\u009cbase innovation on direct insights from end-users\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Of course, there are many factors that feed into innovation success, but identifying innovation opportunities that will resonate with your customers is a critical first step.\nYour customers are talking right now, providing you with the clues and context to identify your next big innovation.

In some instances, marketers may not be able to measure their campaigns\u00e2\u0080\u0099 branding impact as they are bounded by survey study minimums -- but what good is a campaign if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand how it moves awareness, consideration, intent, or other key branding goals?\u00c2\u00a0 \nTo help marketers measure how their campaigns are driving brand lift, we are making Twitter Brand Surveys available for managed accounts in North America, South America, Asia Pacific, Europe and Middle East. We developed Twitter Brand Surveys while keeping accessibility and actionability in mind -- we wanted campaigns, big or small, to have access to survey studies and for brands to understand which specific Tweets drove the highest lift.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nLow minimum media spend\nTwitter Brand Surveys is a 1st party solution, allowing us to offer a low minimum media spend requirement while still delivering statistically significant results. This gives marketers the opportunity to scale survey studies beyond large campaigns. Contact your Twitter account rep to learn more about the minimum spend in your region.\u00c2\u00a0\nActionable insights through Creative Attribution\nTwitter Brand Survey reports provide insights beyond topline results -- they deliver insights into how certain elements of your campaign and creatives are driving brand lift. We developed a proprietary Creative Attribution model to identify the Promoted Tweet or In-Stream Video Ad responsible for high and low brand lift, which helps marketers hone their creative strategy for the future.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditionally, marketers can learn how the frequency of their ad exposure affects brand metrics or understand the lift in message association for their brand and its competitors (hint: if there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lift for your competitor, perhaps the creative and messaging is not differentiated enough).\nQuick reporting turnaround\nTo help marketers fine-tune campaign and creative strategy for future campaigns in a timely manner, Twitter strives to deliver reports to clients within 10 business days after the campaign ends.\u00c2\u00a0\nMany brands have already started using Twitter Brand Surveys to understand how their campaigns are driving brand lift.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor the launch of its new Pandora Reflexions\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 collection, Pandora (\u00e2\u0080\u008e@PANDORA_NA) partnered with Mindshare and Twitter to drive awareness of their new line and used Twitter Brand Survey to measure results. The insights from Twitter Brand Surveys quantified Pandora\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success, revealing statistically significant increases in campaign awareness, consideration, and Tweet recall. It also helped Pandora reinforce its current campaign and creative strategy for the future.

People have become desensitized to hearing companies say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe value your privacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and are worn out from being asked to accept privacy policies that they rarely, if ever, even read. Many companies make these declarations without even showing people what actions they are taking to protect their privacy. And let's be honest, we have room for improvement too.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe believe companies should be accountable to the people that trust them with their personal information, and responsible not only to protect that information but to explain how they do it.\u00c2\u00a0\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching the Twitter Privacy Center to provide more clarity around what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to protect the information people share with us. It is the central place that host\u00e2\u0080\u0099s everything that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of our privacy and data protection work: related initiatives, announcements, new privacy products, and communication about security incidents. It should be easier to find and learn more about the work we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing to keep your data secure, including what data we collect, how we use it, and the controls you have.\nHow we think about Privacy and Data Protection at Twitter\nPeople\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to privacy and data protection is something we have fought to protect since Twitter was created in 2006. From the beginning, we have offered a range of ways for people to be part of the conversation on Twitter on their terms \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from creating pseudonymous accounts to protect their identity to letting people control who sees their Tweets. But what people see externally is not the sum of our work. Behind the scenes, teams across the company are constantly working to protect your privacy and data. This work has three areas of focus:\nFix technical debt. Twitter has changed a lot since the first Tweet was sent almost 14 years ago. As was, and still is, common in fast-growing tech companies, we built new features and services on top of older systems. In some cases, the older systems were never made to support their current uses \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical debt. Tackling technical debt is an ongoing challenge for every company, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing it for years. This work isn't just good for the privacy and safety of people who use Twitter, it's also good for business. It will help us get better products and services to you faster. Also, you may have noticed that we have been communicating more data and security related disclosures over the last two years. Many of those are the direct result of these efforts. We have been working to make sure our systems meet your expectations, and when they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t or when we have found issues that may require your attention to keep you safe and secure, we have told you about them. We'll continue to do this when something requires your attention.\u00c2\u00a0\nBuild privacy into the products we launch. Privacy by design is a priority with every product we build. To achieve this, we continue to build out our processes to review the products we launch. This process involves our Information Security, Product and Privacy Counsel teams, and our independent Office of Data Protection. This is critical work that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to invest in. Every new employee goes through data privacy, security, and management training. We launched an internal group called Twitter Doves, which is designed to cultivate the best data privacy, security and management practices for everyone at the company. The Doves\u00e2\u0080\u0099 motto, \"trust is earned, not given,\" guides best practices we adhere to across Twitter. Finally, we're speaking with people around the world to better understand how different cultures and groups think about privacy and what they expect when they share their information with a company like ours. For example, through the initial findings from this research, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned that \u00e2\u0080\u009cmeaningful controls\u00e2\u0080\u009d have different connotations depending on where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from. This kind of feedback is critical to us as we build the privacy and data controls people want when they use Twitter.\nKeep ourselves accountable to the people that trust us with their data. We know that there is no silver bullet that will make people trust us with their data. However, we also know that to keep your trust we have to show you we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re accountable. We have already taken a variety of steps to weave accountability into how we operate. Our Data Protection Officer, Damien Kieran, provides an independent assessment of all privacy and data protection-related work to our board of directors on a quarterly basis to make sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re appropriately discussing any issues and concerns we have and to drive alignment on what matters from a data protection perspective. We are continuing to invest in our Data Management Organization so that we can always account for the data we have, how it is used, and when it is shared. To make sure everyone at Twitter is accountable, privacy and data protection is the heart of our 2020 company-wide priority to build products that earn the trust of people who use them.

To make this happen, we need to change how conversations work on our service. Currently, repliers can shift the topic or tone of a discussion and derail what you and your audience want to talk about. To give you more control over the conversations you start, we tested the option for you to hide replies to your Tweets. We learned that the feature is a useful new way to manage your conversations. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making this available to everyone globally.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how it works. Anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets. Everyone can see and engage with hidden replies by tapping the grey icon that will appear on the Tweets. This way, you have more control over the conversations you start, but people can still see the entire conversation.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we learned during our tests:\nPeople mostly hide replies they think are irrelevant, off-topic, or annoying. \nThe option is a new way to shut out noise; 85% of the people who hide replies are not using block or mute. \nPeople were curious to see how public figures like those in politics and journalism would use this update. So far, they aren't hiding replies very often.\nIn Canada, 27% of people who had their Tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future. Also, they thought it was a helpful way to manage what they saw, similar to muted keywords.\nWe learned that you may want to take further action after you hide a reply, so now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll check to see if you want to also block the replier.\nSome people mentioned that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hide replies due to fear of retaliation as the icon remains visible. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to get feedback on this.\nThese are early findings and we look forward to continued learning as the feature is used by more people. \nLooking ahead, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working on new controls and more clarity around the rules of conversation spaces. Soon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be launching a new hide replies endpoint so developers can build additional conversation management tools. We're exploring more options around who can reply to or see specific conversations, and are testing engagement changes to see if these lead to healthier discussions. We're committed to making sure people feel safe and comfortable talking on Twitter.\nThe option to hide replies is rolling out globally on iOS, Android, Twitter Lite, and twitter.com.

Deliberate attempts to mislead or confuse people through manipulated media undermine the integrity of the conversation.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we recently announced our plan to seek public input on a new rule to address synthetic and manipulated media. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve called for public feedback previously because we want to ensure that \u00e2\u0080\u0094 as an open service\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 our rules reflect the voice of the people who use Twitter. We think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to consider global perspectives, as well as make our content moderation decisions easier to understand.  What is synthetic and manipulated media?  The Twitter Rules, the service, and its features are always evolving, based on new behavior we see online. We routinely consult with experts and researchers to help us understand new issues like synthetic and manipulated media. Based on these conversations, we propose defining synthetic and manipulated media as any photo, audio, or video that has been significantly altered or fabricated in a way that intends to mislead people or changes its original meaning. These are sometimes referred to as deepfakes or shallowfakes.  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a draft of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do when we see synthetic and manipulated media that purposely tries to mislead or confuse people:  Twitter may:\nplace a notice next to Tweets that share synthetic or manipulated media;\nwarn people before they share or like Tweets with synthetic or manipulated media; or\nadd a link \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for example, to a news article or Twitter Moment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so that people can read more about why various sources believe the media is synthetic or manipulated.\nIn addition, if a Tweet including synthetic or manipulated media is misleading and could threaten someone's physical safety or lead to other serious harm, we may remove it.  We want to hear from you You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find here a brief survey, which is available in English, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish, Portuguese, and Japanese. For languages not represented here, our team is working closely with local non-governmental organizations and policymakers to ensure their perspectives are represented.  If you prefer to Tweet your feedback, we'll be listening there, too. Use the hashtag #TwitterPolicyFeedback.  Additionally, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to partner with us to develop solutions to detect synthetic and manipulated media, fill out this form.  The feedback period will close on Wednesday, Nov. 27 at 11:59 p.m. GMT. At that point, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll review the input we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received, make adjustments, and begin the process of incorporating the policy into the Twitter Rules, as well as train our enforcement teams on how to handle this content. We will make another announcement at least 30 days before the policy goes into effect.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to serving the public conversation on Twitter and doing our work in an open and transparent manner.

From focus groups to behavioral analytics to neuroscience techniques \u00e2\u0080\u0093 today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research professionals wield a wide array of techniques and tools - from the simple to the more sophisticated - all to better understand people and their behaviour as consumers. Couple this with the power of big data analytics, and you might think the picture of today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer is all but complete. And yet, is there a single business who can confidently say that they really know their customers on an emotional level?\nIt turns out that we humans are emotional beings and, not surprisingly, that emotionality extends to consumer decision-making. As author and Harvard scholar Gerald Zaltman asserts, 95% of decisions are made in the emotional domain1. Taken one step further, consider the System 1 and System 2 theory posited by noted psychologists Kahneman and Tversky which echoes Zaltman \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the first impulse is always emotional and comes from our reptile brain, which then gets processed (or not) by the rational neocortex. What that means for our understanding of the customer is that without intercepting that first impulse, we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be sure we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re capturing the real intent; that raw, unfiltered, unprocessed response.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tried.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhether through focus groups or surveys, we ask customers to share their feelings and motivations about our products and services, as well as their purchase and post-purchase experience. But this approach to analyzing customer experience is limited. Because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done in a way that encourages filtered, rationally processed and controlled retrospective responses, the moment is lost and with it the emotion.\nSo, how best to fulfil your quest for the holy grail of emotion?\nThe key is to capture unprompted reactions in the moment. While tapping directly into a consumer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain is unrealistic, not to mention unethical, there is one place where consumers are freely sharing their emotions, unprompted, in the moment. Every minute of every day, people around the world are sharing their thoughts, experiences and opinions as they happen on Twitter. More often than not, emotion is part of the mix. When they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re feeling something about your brand or product, those emotions often convert into action. Eileen had the best stay at your resort? Her friends take note and may visit. Kenny\u00e2\u0080\u0099s child wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t treated well at a drama camp? Other parents are now on alert. Diana found the interviewing experience at your company odd? Other potential recruits may opt to give it a pass.\nBy listening to those voices we not only have an unprecedented opportunity to engage directly with our customers and react quickly, we can take it a step further by identifying insights that bring us closer than ever to understanding them on an emotional level. This deeper understanding can be put to work shaping better customer experiences my making emotional connections and ultimately driving greater customer satisfaction and brand affinity.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith traditional research, it may take some time and effort to understand how your customers really feel. With Twitter, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to ask the question \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know before your surveys, focus groups or sales data tell you.\nYour customers are talking. Are you ready to start listening? Get inspired at data.twitter.com with case studies that illustrate the power of social listening.\n1 How Customers Think: Essential Insights into the Mind of the Market, by Gerald Zaltman\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

Part of that effort is our biannual Twitter Transparency Report, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve produced since July 2012 to share global trends across a number of areas of our enforcement on Twitter, including the Twitter Rules and legal requests we receive.\u00c2\u00a0\nThe report is ever-evolving. For the first time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incorporating data and insights regarding impersonation policy enforcement, as well as state-backed information operations datasets that were previously released to the public to empower research and awareness of these campaigns.\u00c2\u00a0\nSince the last Twitter Transparency Report, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continued to further invest in proactive technology to positively and directly impact people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conversations on the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nHere are key highlights from that work, which relate to the latest reporting period (January 1 to June 30, 2019)*:\nMore than 50% of Tweets we take action on for abuse are now proactively surfaced using technology, rather than relying on reports to Twitter;\n105% increase in accounts actioned by Twitter (locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules);\nContinuing a year-on-year trend, a 30% decrease in accounts suspended for the promotion of terrorism; and\n67% more global legal demands, originating from 49 different countries.\u00c2\u00a0\n*All figures compared to the last reporting period.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Rules enforcement Our continued investment in proprietary technology is steadily reducing the burden on people to report to us. For example, more than 50% of Tweets we take action on for abuse are now being surfaced using technology. This compares to just 20% a year ago.\u00c2\u00a0\nAdditionally, due to a combination of our increased focus on proactively surfacing potentially violative content for human review and the inclusion of impersonation data for the first time, we saw a 105% increase in accounts locked or suspended for violating the Twitter Rules. \nSpecific policy content areas:\nPrivate information: We saw a 48% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our private information policies. We suspended 119% more accounts than the previous reporting period. This increase may be attributed to the launch of improvements to our reporting flow that make it easier to report private information, as well as changes to our internal enforcement processes which permit bystanders to report potential private information violations for review.\nSensitive media: We saw a 37% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our sensitive media policies. We actioned 41% more accounts.\nHateful conduct: There was a 48% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our hateful conduct policies. We actioned 133% more accounts compared to the last reporting period.\nAbuse: We saw a 22% increase in accounts reported for potential violations of our abuse policies. We took action on 68% more accounts compared to the last reporting period.\nImpersonation: Impersonation is when an account poses as another person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner and is prohibited by the Twitter Rules. During this reporting period, we took enforcement action on 124,339 accounts for violating our impersonation policy.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPlatform manipulation We also continue to focus on deterring potentially spammy accounts at the time of account creation; often before their first Tweet. However, our enforcement actions tend to fluctuate for a variety of reasons, often due to the type of spam.\nThis reporting period, our anti-spam challenges \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where we ask people to provide a phone number or email address or fill in a ReCAPTCHA code to verify there is a human behind an account \u00e2\u0080\u0094 fell by nearly 50%.\u00c2\u00a0\nRemoval of terrorist content A total of 115,861 accounts were suspended for violations related to the promotion of terrorism this reporting period, down 30% from the previous reporting period. This continues a year-on-year decrease in the number of accounts promoting terrorist content on Twitter as we take more comprehensive enforcement action using our technology and strengthen partnerships with our peers. Of those suspensions, 87% consisted of accounts we proactively flagged using internal, proprietary removal tools.\nRemoval of child sexual exploitation content During this reporting period, we suspended a total of 244,188 accounts for violations related to child sexual exploitation. Of the unique accounts suspended, 91% were surfaced by a combination of technology solutions (including PhotoDNA and internal, proprietary tools).\nLegal requests In addition to enforcing the Twitter Rules, we also may take action in response to legal requests.\nCopyright violations:\nWe received a 101% increase in DMCA takedown notices since our last report. However, many were incomplete or not actionable. We continue to see a high volume of fraudulent DMCA reports from Turkey and Japan, while fraudulent reports from Brazil also continue to increase.\nTrademark notices:\nWe saw a 39% increase in the total number of trademark notices received since our last report. The increase is likely due to an influx of reports that failed to provide sufficient information to take any action on our part.\nInformation requests (legal requests for account information):\nInformation requests from the United States continue to make up the highest percentage of legal requests for account information. During this reporting period, 29% of all global requests for account information originated within the United States.\nNational security requests:\nAt this time we are only able to share information about the number of National Security Letters (NSLs) received which are no longer subject to non-disclosure orders. We believe it is much more meaningful to publish these actual numbers than reporting in the bands authorized per the USA Freedom Act. Our litigation in the case Twitter v. Barr continues.\nDuring this reporting period, we notified people affected by three additional NSLs after the gag orders were lifted. As reflected in the report, non-disclosure orders for 17 total NSLs have been lifted to date. Twitter is committed to continuing to use the legal mechanism available to us to request a judicial review of these gag orders.\nRemoval requests (legal requests for content removal)*:\nCompared to the previous reporting period, we received roughly 67% more legal requests to remove content, originating from 49 different countries. Of the requests received, 80% of the volume originated from Japan, Russia, and Turkey. We withheld content in a country 2,457 times, at either an account or Tweet level.\n*We continue to publish these legal requests when we take action directly to the Lumen Database, a partnership with Harvard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.\nWe remain deeply committed to transparency at Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it continues to be one of our key guiding principles. This commitment is reflected in the evolution and expansion of the report in recent years: It now includes dedicated sections on platform manipulation and spam, our Twitter Rules enforcement, and state-backed information operations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously removed from the service.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis report reflects not only the evolution of the public conversation on our service but the work we do every day to protect and support the people who use Twitter.

A somewhat radical strategy at the time, Comcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s move to social proved to be the first step in a journey towards embedding social into their customer experience.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, millions of people come to Twitter to express their thoughts, experiences and opinions -\u00c2\u00a0 making Twitter one of the top channels where customers engage with brands, including airing their customer service woes. Offering some level of social customer service just makes good business sense.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn my work, I spend a lot of time talking to and educating companies on the potential of Twitter data. When it comes to social customer service I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed that most companies fall into three stages of maturity.\nStage 1 - Emerging\nMany companies begin providing social customer service almost accidentally, as a result of their social media marketing efforts. Customers find their social marketing channels and concerns flow in. Conscientious marketers do their best to direct these incoming service issues to the right people so they can close the loop with a response. But a lack of clear ownership means messages occasionally fall through the cracks, and there is very little performance tracking on customer service interactions let alone service-level agreements (SLAs). The focus tends to be on \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest-effort\u00e2\u0080\u009d and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s common practice to deflect the incoming customer service enquiries to other support channels such as phone or email.\u00c2\u00a0\nCompanies at this emerging stage of maturity would benefit most from clear guidelines accompanied by staff training for interacting with customers on social media. In addition, a good social media management tool would go a long way in preventing things from falling through the cracks; improving social media response times while also facilitating better cross-team collaboration.\nStage 2 - Established\nAt this stage of their social care journey, businesses have fully adopted social customer service as an equal to established channels such as phone, email or chat. With clear guidelines in place, one or more trained agents are dedicated to resolving social enquiries on the originating platform (versus diverting to phone or email). SLAs such as First Response Time and Time to Resolution are in place and monitored. A social care tool is in use and with it, defined routing and approval workflows.\nMany businesses stay at this stage and feel satisfied that they are getting the job of social customer care done. They are responsive and their customers are appreciative. Why change anything? But, by not looking to further innovate and mature their program, they may be missing out on an opportunity to create deeper value for both their customers and their business.\u00c2\u00a0\nStage 3 - Innovator\nIn the third and most advanced stage of social care maturity, businesses shift from social adoption to social innovation. They are proactively promoting social (including messaging) as a channel where customers can receive expedited customer service. Customer experience delivery is driven by \u00e2\u0080\u0098social engagement centers\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Part marketing and part care, these \u00e2\u0080\u009ccenters\u00e2\u0080\u009d are designed to not only resolve customer issues but to also proactively engage with the public on topics and events of relevance to the business. They blend human interaction and automation (such as bots) into a unified service experience and are able to collect real-time Net Promoter Score (NPS) and Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) feedback. Their social media suite is integrated with other critical systems allowing for more holistic customer visibility to enable personalization. They know who their customers are, the issues they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in the past and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to be treated.\nBusinesses in this stage see their approach to social as a true differentiator and source of competitive differentiation. They have adopted an innovation mindset and are quick to adopt best practices and benchmark themselves against their peers. Crucially, they have senior leadership buy-in who practice what they preach, actively engaging with customers.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe social customer care journey\nOver ten years have passed since @ComcastCares went live. Their social care experiment has grown from handling a few thousand conversations a year to well over 50k a month, and social customer service has become an integral part of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer experience.

You can read it in more detail here.\nUNESCO and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership\nThe resource is a product of Twitter and UNESCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ongoing 18 month global partnership in this area, during which time we supported NGOs working on media and information literacy through our Ads For Good programme and supported their #MILClicks programme with a range of on-service activity, such as the serialisation of content from @MILClicks.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSome of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other activities include:\u00c2\u00a0\nLaunching a dedicated emoji with accompanying hashtags #GlobalMILWeek, #ThinkBeforeSharing, and #ThinkBeforeClicking.\nPartnering with the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) to support Media Literacy Week in the United States using the hashtag #MediaLitWk.\u00c2\u00a0\nOffering Ads For Good grants to NGOs in @UNESCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network to help raise awareness for their work.\nVP of Public Policy, Government and Corporate Philanthropy at Twitter, Colin Crowell, states: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Twitter, we are hopeful that this Handbook will have a tangible, beneficial impact on students across the world by helping educators impart critical information and skills to younger generations about how to navigate an increasingly complicated media environment. We deeply treasure our global partnership with UNESCO on media and information literacy and this project strongly benefits\u00c2\u00a0 from UNESCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in this area. We look forward to continued discussion and collaboration with UNESCO on how media and information literacy can be a defence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly in our young people \u00e2\u0080\u0094 against disinformation and political propaganda around the world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nMoez Chakchouk, Assistant Director-General of UNESCO says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolarized information is driving a rise in hate and discrimination and is often amplified by inauthentic and malicious activity, while disinformation is compromising democracy and development. Promoting media and information literacy learning through social media platforms, such as this Twitter and UNESCO collaboration, could be far-reaching if systematically implemented and sustained.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continues, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is only the start of Twitter and UNESCO working together, we can expand our cooperation to give more impetus to promoting media and information literate citizenry in online spaces.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\neducation\npartnerships\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

We are smack in the middle of an era like no other, characterized by exciting emerging and evolving technologies like cloud computing, mobile devices, artificial intelligence and the internet of things, all fueled by accelerating connectivity speeds. And, by taking advantage of technology to transform your business, you are motivated by outcomes like increased efficiency, greater profits and in some cases, new market opportunities.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn parallel with this is another emerging phenomenon - the empowered consumer.\u00c2\u00a0 People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expectations for companies they do business with have changed. Concerns around issues like security, privacy, transparency, corporate social responsibility, immediacy, and personalization are finding a voice and informing people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decisions about whether or not to do business with a company. And what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing those opinions well beyond their traditional social circles at home and at the office.\nEmpowered and influential consumers can make or break your business. With the stakes so high, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it make sense that you put the customer at the center of your digital transformation strategy?\u00c2\u00a0\nRead your customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minds with social listening\nFortunately, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minds. Technology and tools have empowered customers to communicate more easily and frequently than ever before. Well over half of the world is online where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending an average of almost 7 hours every day. A portion of that time is spent communicating feedback (both prompted and unprompted) on the brands they encounter and care about, whether through writing reviews, completing surveys, or sharing opinions and experiences on social media platforms like Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nOn Twitter, people share hundreds of millions of Tweets every day. And, at every stage of the customer journey, they are signalling satisfaction, concerns, frictions, and conflicts through their posts. They are not only expressing how they feel but why they feel that way. And, thanks to social listening tools, you can easily tap into these conversations, uncovering insights in real-time as well as historical patterns. When combined with other more traditional data from sources like surveys, focus groups or research, you can come closer than ever to knowing your customers on a deeper level and understanding their wants, needs and concerns.\u00c2\u00a0\nExamples of digital transformation with unintended consequences\nConsider some of the unintended consequences of digital transformation. In the case of US restaurant chain Shake Shack, they piloted a cashier-less, cash-free location. The self-serve kiosks promised to streamline customer service while reducing operating expenses. Unfortunately, the initiative was abandoned after 6 months. Why? It turns out Shake Shack customers like to customize their orders and the new human-free system didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t permit this flexibility. And, believe it or not, many people still want to pay with cash. Could a deeper understanding of their customers have better set up this digital transformation initiative for success?\u00c2\u00a0\nDigital transformation in banking is another interesting example. Most of us have embraced the flexibility of online banking yet this transformation is still fraught with challenges. According to recent research from J.D. Power, 28% of US retail bank customers are now digital-only, but they are the least satisfied among all customer segments examined in the study. Digital-only experiences are not living up to customer expectations in the areas of communication and advice; products and fees; and new account opening. Could banks be better equipped to tackle these challenges with a deeper understanding of their digital customers?\nDigital transformation strategy development: customers are key\nWhether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s introducing automation or AI, shifting from bricks and mortar to digital, moving to the cloud or changing backend infrastructure, companies need to put customers at the center of their digital transformation strategy. Get it right and you will be the beneficiary of everything promised by digital transformation, including happier customers and lasting brand loyalty. Get it wrong and you risk the wrath of the empowered customer.\nYour customers are talking. Are you ready to start listening?

Brands have long been household names, but with a strong social media presence, they can now occupy an even more personal place in our lives.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith so much noise it can be difficult for brands to build genuine relationships with their target audiences. For the brands that clear this hurdle, the payoff is real. When those connections are established, brands are rewarded with a boost in customer loyalty and spending and word-of-mouth recommendations\u00e2\u0080\u0094all direct contributions to their bottom line.\u00c2\u00a0 \nSprout Social data shows that 57% of people will increase their spend with a brand when they feel connected to it. To narrow in on that perspective, 62% of the people on Twitter don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to spend more money for the products or services of a brand they like (compared to 51% of the general online population). \nPutting customers and their wants at the center of your digital strategy is vital if you want to foster long-lasting relationships. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve highlighted five things brands must do to better connect with their audiences and turn casual followers into engaged brand advocates.\n1. Treat Twitter as the core customer experience element it is.\nIn an environment with so much potential for meaningful relationships, there are big expectations: 78% of consumers want brands to use social to help people connect with each other. \nBusinesses can no longer ignore the value of digital. Outdated excuses (i.e. that it is too difficult to quantify success and that it does not affect the bottom line) are no longer valid today. Twitter is transforming how customers and brands talk to one another, making it an integral part of the consumer experience. Companies like Apple, for example, have their own support handles specifically for handling customer service requests and answering product questions.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. Use a mix of entertaining and educational content to attract followers.\nWhile many want the content they come across to entertain, your content strategy has to strike a balance between showing what your brand offers and what your brand represents. 57% of people on Twitter will favor brands that share their values, compared to just 45% of the general online population.\u00c2\u00a0\nWell-executed educational content can make people feel good about your product and confident about choosing you over competitors. Half of consumers follow a brand on social to learn about new products and services.\nThat said, people still want to be engaged and entertained before they buy. 50% of social marketers say entertaining and inspirational posts are the most effective in helping them reach their goals.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Utilize formats like live video to engage with your audience.\nVideo has reigned as the digital content king over the past few years. But despite the push for video, marketers are still behind when it comes to nurturing their video presence, resulting in missed opportunities to connect with consumers. With 45% of consumers wanting to see more live video from brands, marketers should invest in video for sustained future growth.\u00c2\u00a0\nCultivating communities also offers brands a unique opportunity to connect directly with their audiences. More than two-thirds of consumers will join a private group because they want to connect with people who are similar to them, while almost half (46%) join to communicate directly with a brand or business. The larger the landscape becomes, the more private communities can help brands stay in close contact with their customers.\n4. Create posts offering trials or discounts to convert followers into customers.\nA good deal never gets old. Of consumers that follow brands on social but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buy from them, 61% said posts offering discounts or free trials encourage them to make their first purchase. Promotional content is one of the few cut-and-dried ways businesses quantify social performance as it relates to sales goals and ensure a boost in customer loyalty. Brands can take advantage of holidays like Black Friday or Cyber Monday to offer exclusive discounts that get buyers excited. Space Camp USA, for example, created Tweets highlighting a limited-time promotion for Black Friday shoppers.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. Leverage authentic advocacy to grab your audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention.\nWhen marketers take the time to build authentic consumer relationships, they are rewarded with an increase in web traffic, a boost in sales and\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest organic marketing tools\u00e2\u0080\u0094word-of-mouth advocacy.\u00c2\u00a0\nOne way to move consumers to action is to leverage employee advocacy, a strategy currently employed by 72% of all social marketers. When brands encourage employees to share content to their own networks, 45% of consumers say they are more likely to research that product or service. Starbucks, for example, has a unique employee advocacy program that encourages staff members to share brand updates and news on Twitter.\nThese advantages make it easy to see why more brands are embracing the employee advocacy as a business priority.\u00c2\u00a0\nMoving toward a social-first customer experience\nIn an era where consumers seek meaningful experiences with brands and are drawn to authentic conversations, a business with no social presence is one with no future. People crave connection with their favorite brands, and Twitter provide consumers with a direct line of communication.\nSocial is the perfect place to start meaningful relationships with customers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an environment that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intimate, where we celebrate the ability to share and connect with one another. As a brand, make everything you deliver there count.\nTo learn more about Sprout Social, check out their profile on partners.twitter.com.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@OfficialPartner \n#BuildConnection\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

We welcome the conversation and want to share more context on our principles and process for reviewing reported Tweets from these accounts.\u00c2\u00a0\nContext\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen it comes to the actions of world leaders on Twitter, we recognize that this is largely new ground and unprecedented. We understand the desire for our decisions to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes/no\u00e2\u0080\u009d binaries, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that simple. The actions we take and policies we develop will set precedent around online speech and we owe it to the people we serve to be deliberate and considered in what we do.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur mission is to provide a forum that enables people to be informed and to engage their leaders directly. We also have a responsibility to the people who use Twitter to better explain why we make the decisions we make, which we will do here.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur approach\nEverything we do starts with an understanding of our purpose and of the service we provide: a place where people can participate in public conversation and get informed about the world around them.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe assess reported Tweets from world leaders against the Twitter Rules, which are designed to ensure people can participate in the public conversation freely and safely.\nWe focus on the language of reported Tweets and do not attempt to determine all potential interpretations of the content or its intent.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nPresently, direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, if a Tweet from a world leader does violate the Twitter Rules but there is a clear public interest value to keeping the Tweet on the service, we may place it behind a notice that provides context about the violation and allows people to click through should they wish to see the content. We announced this in June.\u00c2\u00a0\nEnforcement scenarios\u00c2\u00a0\nWe want to make it clear today that the accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely. The below areas will result in enforcement action for any account on our service (without consideration of the potential public interest value in allowing the Tweet to remain visible behind a notice):\nPromotion of terrorism;\u00c2\u00a0\nClear and direct threats of violence against an individual (context matters: as noted above, direct interactions with fellow public figures and/or commentary on political and foreign policy issues would likely not result in enforcement);\u00c2\u00a0\nPosting private information, such as a home address or non-public personal phone number;\nPosting or sharing intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent;\nEngaging in behaviors relating to child sexual exploitation; and\u00c2\u00a0\nEncouraging or promoting self-harm.\nIn other cases involving a world leader, we will err on the side of leaving the content up if there is a clear public interest in doing so.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith critical elections and shifting political dynamics around the world, we recognize that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re operating in an increasingly complex and polarized political culture. These are constantly evolving challenges and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep our policies and approach under advisement, particularly as we learn more about the relationship between Tweets from world leaders and the potential for offline harm.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis post seeks to provide clear insight into how we address content from world leaders on Twitter today, and will serve as our statement on the decisions we make, rather than our teams providing feedback on individual Tweets and decisions. We've also updated our dedicated Help Center page to provide a significantly more detailed breakdown of how we make decisions regarding the use of the public interest notice.\nOur goal is to enforce our rules judiciously and impartially. In doing so, we aim to provide direct insight into our enforcement decision-making, to serve public conversation, and protect the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

This is backed up by results from a recent Harris Poll* sponsored by Twitter. Marketing leaders polled revealed that 93% of them are using social media in their programs- from tracking their campaigns to measuring brand equity. 74% also reported using social platforms to perform some customer care \nOver on the CX team, for the most part, if anyone is thinking about social, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an afterthought. According to a recent report from Forrester**, most voice of the customer (VoC) programs are still heavily focused on traditional data sources like surveys and missing out on unstructured and unsolicited data like that from social media platforms. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nDoes marketing know something that CX doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?\nHere are 3 big things marketers know about social media data that they need to share with their CX colleagues:\n1. Social is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening right now\nWhile surveys continue to be the bread and butter of CX programs, by their very nature they are limited because they only measure a moment in time. What marketers understand is that customers are also providing a steady stream of feedback in real-time, and in the case of Twitter, that feedback is intentionally public.\u00c2\u00a0 Throughout the customer journey - people are signalling satisfaction, concerns, frictions, and conflicts through their social posts. They are not only expressing how they feel but why they feel that way.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. Social data is authentic (mostly)\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile not to suggest the CX programs aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t collecting authentic feedback, solicited feedback like that from surveys and focus groups is limited and directed by the questions and topics. Marketers who employ social listening strategies are rich in unsolicited feedback. And, sophisticated marketers understand the nuances between the individual social platforms.\u00c2\u00a0For example, Instagram users may post inspirational content and strive to depict their best selves, while over on Twitter, customers are likely to share their unfiltered views on any and every topic - from the mundane to the controversial.\n3. Social is great at surfacing unknowns\nHave you ever been blindsided by unintended consequences from the introduction of a new product or service? Or been surprised when a competitor seemed to predict the future and capitalize on a new trend before anyone else? Marketers know that news often breaks first on social platforms and social data is often the bellwether of emerging trends and issues. By listening, they can insert their voice into breaking topics and identify and mitigate issues before they become a crisis.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\nBy tapping into social data and combining it with traditional data sources, CX practitioners will find themselves one step closer to a true 360 view of the customer. These real-time and authentic reactions to and experiences with your brand - good, bad and neutral, will empower you to shape experiences for the better and win approval and loyalty of your customers.\nAre you ready to integrate social data into your CX program? First step - talk to your marketing team. Chances are, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been waiting for your call.\u00c2\u00a0 Need more support?

Are you listening?\n            By\n            \n  \n  \nWednesday, 25 September 2019\nLink copied successfully\nI think we can all agree, the digital revolution is over. By that I mean the shift from analog to digital is fully underway and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no way to unring the technology bell. Think about it. More than half the world is online with more people connecting every day. People everywhere are online, blending their work and personal lives while searching, reading, watching, playing, listening and connecting to share experiences, opinions and information - every minute of every day. Consider these numbers published by TNW earlier this year:\n57% of the world is online where on average they spend almost 7 hours of the day \n45% of the world are social media users \n2.8B people are shopping online, spending almost $3B/year ($634 each) \nOver 95% of consumers say they are at least somewhat influenced by what other people say about brands on social media \nIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a customer experience (CX) expert, take note - these are your customers. And, their move online has fundamentally changed how they interact with your brand - sharing their thoughts, preferences and experiences at every stage of the customer journey - and you may be missing all of it. Status quo customer experience and Voice of the Customer programs chug along - trying to integrate new data sources while relying on tried and true traditional research methods - surveys, focus groups and interviews. By overlooking a wealth of untapped social data, your picture of your customer only grows murkier.\nBut it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be that way.\u00c2\u00a0\nImagine getting an unprecedented view of your customer through realtime, unprompted and authentic reactions to your brand, surfacing what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important now as well as who and what is influencing them.\u00c2\u00a0 And, imagine putting those insights to work to respond to your customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs and shape their experience for the better, winning their approval and loyalty.\nPeople around the world are sharing hundreds of millions of Tweets every day, making Twitter the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest publicly available searchable archive of consumer thoughts, experiences and opinions. You can tap into and harness those conversations through social listening and monitoring. Combined with your other data sources, those tweets paint a more accurate picture of your customers. Not only can this newfound understanding catch an issue before it becomes a crisis, but it can also lead to new products and services, customer retention insights, process improvements and more. All ultimately driving towards the holy grail of CX, increased customer satisfaction scores.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been thinking a lot about how Twitter data can contribute to CX programs and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be sharing some of those thoughts in upcoming posts.

The following checklist can help guide you to the best solution for your business.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe Social Customer Service Checklist\nCustomer Service Analytics  Key care-focused metrics should include First Response Time, Average Handling Time and Time to Resolution. What metrics are available and will you be able to create custom metrics to align with your specific business needs?\nApproval Workflows  Will you be able to create permission-based custom workflows for the purposes of agent collaboration, content approval and quality control?\nCustomer Experience Auditing  The ability to access and export the full conversation history and call agent actions is especially critical in highly regulated industries such as financial services.\nCase Management and Ticketing  Can you create cases or tickets for follow-up and/or escalation? What about connectors or integrations to commonly used case management platforms?\nCustomer Service Chatbots  Can you integrate chatbots? Twitter has deployed a number of features to improve customer experiences such as welcome messages and quick replies. Will you have access to these features?\nCompliance and Information Security  Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SOC2 accreditation or other certifications important in your industry and/or country.\nConversation history  Threading public tweets and private Direct Messages together into a conversation view provides valuable context should an issue need to be escalated or passed to another agent. Twitter has made it easy for brands to move a customer from a Tweet into a private message with the launch of Direct Message deep links.\nCredibility  Specific industries tend to have their own needs when it comes to customer care. Does the vendor understand and have experience in your industry? Ask for case studies and customer references.\nCRM & ID Matching  Can you add tags and notes to social profiles? How are these additions added to your CRM? Twitter allows brands to match user IDs to customer records under specific circumstances - if the user has expressly consented or the matching is being done based on publicly available data and/or data provided directly by the applicable Twitter user that an individual would reasonably expect to be used for that purpose.\nData Access  What are the relationships with the social networks being featured? Enterprise level? Whitelisted access to API feeds? These relationships matter, when it comes to your mission-critical customer care operation. Certified Twitter Official Partners can be found here https://partners.twitter.com/en.\nCustomer Care Feedback  Can you deploy CSAT and NPS surveys as well as track sentiment conversion? Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Customer Feedback feature enables people to privately share their opinions with a business after a service interaction. Will you have the option to access this feature?\nIntegrations & pre-built Connectors  Which third-party software integrations are important to you? If you can access them, how? Are they uni-directional, bi-directional or an iframe? What about custom integrations?\nCustomer Knowledge Base  Is there a built-in knowledge base for care agents with suggested answers based on the context of the message? What about connectors to your existing knowledge base or content management system?\nOnboarding  What will the onboarding process look like, both for product training and the softer side of social care such as establishing an appropriate tone of voice?\nRouting & Prioritization  How will social messages be routed and prioritized to appropriate care agents? There are many options including routing based on keywords, influencer score and CRM history. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget language-specific routing for localization and global coverage.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nYour customers are waiting for you on Twitter.

We launched this initiative to empower academic and public understanding of these coordinated campaigns around the world, and to empower independent, third-party scrutiny of these tactics on our platform.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs our investigations of platform manipulation around the world have continued, we subsequently added new datasets in January, June and August, while also sharing insights on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal investigative approach and how these complex, sometimes cross-jurisdictional operations are identified.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nNearly one year on, the archive is now the largest of its kind in the industry. Thousands of researchers have made use of these datasets that contain millions of individual Tweets and more than one terabyte of media. Using our archive, these researchers have conducted their own investigations and shared their insights and independent analyses with the world.\u00c2\u00a0\nTransparency and openness are deep-seated values at the heart of Twitter which define and guide our methodology around these disclosures. Today, we are disclosing six additional datasets covering five separate jurisdictions. Per our policies on platform manipulation, we have permanently suspended all the below accounts from the service.\nUnited Arab Emirates & Egypt\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe have removed a network of 271 accounts originating in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Egypt. These accounts were interconnected in their goals and tactics: a multi-faceted information operation primarily targeting Qatar, and other countries such as Iran. It also amplified messaging supportive of the Saudi government.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe also found evidence that these accounts were created and managed by DotDev, a private technology company operating in the UAE and Egypt. We have permanently suspended DotDev, and all accounts associated with them, from our service.\nAdditionally, we suspended a separate group of 4,248 accounts operating uniquely from the UAE, mainly directed at Qatar and Yemen. These accounts were often employing false personae and tweeting about regional issues, such as the Yemeni Civil War and the Houthi Movement.\u00c2\u00a0\nSaudi Arabia\nOur investigations also detected a small group of six accounts linked to Saudi Arabia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s state-run media apparatus which were engaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government. While active, the accounts in this set presented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government.\u00c2\u00a0\nSeparately, we have also permanently suspended the Twitter account of Saud al-Qahtani for violations of our platform manipulation policies. This account is not included in the archives disclosed today.\nWe continue to suspend a range of accounts for other types of political spam violations in Saudi Arabia. As ever, we will disclose any attribution we can reliably make to state actors if and when we learn them.\nSpain\nWe have removed 259 accounts we identified as falsely boosting public sentiment online in Spain. Operated by Partido Popular, these accounts were active for a relatively short period, and consisted primarily of fake accounts engaging in spamming or retweet behaviour to increase engagement.\u00c2\u00a0\nEcuador\nEarlier in the summer, we removed a network of 1,019 accounts in Ecuador tied to the PAIS Alliance political party. The network, composed largely of fake accounts, was primarily engaged in spreading content about President Moreno\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administration, focusing on issues concerning Ecuadorian laws on freedom of speech, government censorship, and technology. Tactics most commonly used were hashtag manipulation and retweet spam.\u00c2\u00a0\nChina (PRC)/Hong Kong \nIn August, we disclosed that we had identified a network of more than 200,000 fake accounts based in the PRC which were attempting to sow discord about the protest movement in Hong Kong. Today, we are publishing additional datasets relating to 4,301 accounts which were most active in this information operation to further public awareness and understanding.\u00c2\u00a0\nNext steps\u00c2\u00a0\nGoing forward, we will continue to enhance and refine our approach to disclosing state-affiliated information operations on our service. For example, we intend to more routinely disclose data relating to state-backed information operations on the service using our @TwitterSafety handle and in future iterations of the Twitter Transparency Report. We will share more on these plans soon.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nWe see this as a necessary and vital step to regularize our transparency work in this area, and to encourage more third-party investigation of these behaviors online.\nYou can access relevant information on these account sets below.\nSeptember 2019\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndata\ngovernment\nhealth\nresearch\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

Earlier this year we started testing a way to give people more control over the conversations they start. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding this test to Japan and the United States!\nWith this test, we want to understand how conversations on Twitter change if the person who starts a conversation can hide replies. Based on our research and surveys we conducted, we saw a lot of positive trends during our initial test in Canada, including:\nPeople mostly hide replies that they think are irrelevant, abusive or unintelligible. Those who used the tool thought it was a helpful way to control what they saw, similar to when keywords are muted.\nWe saw that people were more likely to reconsider their interactions when their tweet was hidden: 27% of people who had their tweets hidden said they would reconsider how they interact with others in the future.\nPeople were concerned hiding someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply could be misunderstood and potentially lead to confusion or frustration. As a result, now if you tap to hide a Tweet, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll check in with you to see if you want to also block that account.\nThese are positive and heartening results: the feature helped people have better conversations, and was a useful tool against replies that deterred from the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s original intent.\nWe're interested to see if these trends continue, and if new ones emerge, as we expand our test to Japan and the US.

This effort was part of UNICEF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s #ENDviolence campaign. In December last year, young people from around the world drafted the #ENDviolence Youth Manifesto. In it, they shared what they want from their parents, teachers, policymakers and each other to feel safe and supported in and around school \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and kindness stood out as one of the most powerful means to prevent bullying.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo help get the word out, UNICEF partnered with high-profile supporters and K-pop sensation @BTS_twt.

The activation resonated strongly with the values of their audience on Twitter. UNICEF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach aligned with Gen Z users who respond positively to calls to action and who care for social justice. More broadly, we know that people on Twitter care about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world and they want brands to stand for something.\nUNICEF took a conversational approach and encouraged dialogue on Twitter.

While a good sign, we will continue to monitor and focus on retention.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAn updated snapshot of race and ethnicity in the US is below:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn our May I&D report, we provided an overview of our internal diversity dashboards. We recently expanded the functionality so that Tweeps can drill down further into orgs, see trends in representation across the business, and filter by leader and office location. We are committed to sharing diversity data with our people because we know deep transparency builds trust and drives change.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAccountability\u00c2\u00a0\nWe recently rolled out a new I&D Health Check-Up program, a monthly customized report for each member of our leadership team, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cStaff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These check-ups help keep I&D top of mind by giving leaders a more detailed view on hiring, attrition, and promotions for women, black, and Latinx employees across their org. They also provide a tool for business support functions (e.g., recruiters, HRBPs) to tailor efforts for each org and accelerate progress. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHiring & Promos\nDiversifying Leadership We want our Tweeps to see themselves reflected in our leadership. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why in Q3, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching an initiative to require diverse candidate slates for all senior roles (L8 and above). The program requires that at least one female (worldwide) and one black or Latinx (US) qualified candidate be considered by the interview panel. We will share results from this initiative in Q2 of next year.\nRecruiting Diverse Technical Talent We play an important role in growing the pipeline of diverse technical talent. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in next-generation technical leaders from nontraditional backgrounds (coding bootcamps, self-taught coders, veterans, caregivers returning to the workforce, etc.) and those underrepresented in tech (women, black, Latinx, Native American).\u00c2\u00a0\nIn July, we launched our first Engineering Apprenticeship Program, a one-year rotation initially focused on people from nontraditional computer science backgrounds. Upon completion of the program, graduates will transition into one of our engineering teams. Our first cohort arrives in Q4. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to working out the kinks as we learn and grow so the program may reach its full potential in 2020. \nWe are also pursuing a decentralized workforce strategy as a way of expanding our reach to tap into more diverse talent pools. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched a hiring tour for technical roles, currently focused on six cities outside of San Francisco. Interviewing is hard enough, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re offering qualified applicants airfare, hotel stays \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and even onsite childcare \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for those who need it. This initial effort is focused on three skill sets (Backend/Systems, Full Stack, and Mobile) but we may expand to more roles and cities if it proves successful. \nPromotions We review promotions annually. In our most recent analysis, we found that the makeup of employees promoted from January 2018 to December 2018 generally tracked to our demographic population during that time frame.\nFemale employees (global): 40.9% of promotions*\nBlack employees (US): 3.3% of promotions\nLatinx employees (US): 3.7% of promotions\n*Promotions are defined by moving from one grade level to the next.\nBased on these results, we know we can do better. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on addressing promotion of black and Latinx employees, particularly in entry-level technical roles where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching an onboarding program for new grads. We are also evaluating opportunities to formally integrate I&D into the promotion decision-making process.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nScaling a Global I&D Team We are scaling our I&D team! In July, we hired a new global leader, James Loduca (@JamesLoduca),\u00c2\u00a0who is building a team with an eye to all of the ways we want to embed I&D across core business functions. We are also hiring a leader based in Asia Pacific to ensure that our I&D function has a truly global perspective as we scale.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLearning & Development\nOur goal is to embed I&D throughout our learning and development programs. \nThis summer, we conducted \u00e2\u0080\u009cWords Matter\u00e2\u0080\u009d workshops at offices around the globe to empower our Tweeps with inclusive language skills to guide their daily interactions with each other. \nHere are a few things happening in Q4: \nWe are launching weekly workshops as part of an expansion of our Q2 global pilot focused on Healthy Conversations. We are focused on empowering our Tweeps to have healthy conversations around the tough issues that can surface everyday and put health at the center of our culture.\u00c2\u00a0 \nWe are also hosting our fourth cohort of WELead, our leadership program for emerging female talent, and launching our first Global Female Leaders Program in partnership with Stanford University. \nMoving forward, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building out a portfolio of learning and development that we can deploy at scale on topics like Unconscious Bias, Inclusive Hiring, and Inclusive Leadership. We hope to have these programs in place by the first half of next year. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nConnecting with our Tweeps\nTweeps play a critical and active role in building an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Here are some Q2 highlights. \nFlock Talk The health of our employees is our top priority. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why in August we launched Flock Talk, a program that builds on past efforts for Tweeps to come together during difficult times to share what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with them, find community, and be heard by our leaders. This session was focused on hearing from Latinx Tweeps and allies in the wake of a series of events targeting Latinx people in the United States. More than 150 Tweeps from across the US and Mexico participated in the first session. The program coincides with the formation of an internal working group to meet regularly and review opportunities to better protect and promote diverse voices across our company and service.\n#TweepTour  Our leaders were on the road this summer visiting Twitter offices in Atlanta, Madrid, Paris, London, Hamburg, Dublin, Dubai, Bangalore, and New York to hear directly from our Tweeps. Their feedback revealed opportunities to better resource our BRGs and make them truly global, empower all Tweeps with tools to be allies, and create inspirational moments for Tweeps to create a more diverse and inclusive Twitter around the world. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already working to address what we heard!\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBusiness Resource Groups Our BRGs are the foundation of our inclusion efforts at Twitter. To ensure they have the resources and support they need to be successful on a global scale, we are implementing these enhancements:\nExpanded global leadership structure implemented across all BRGs\nNew strategic planning and budgeting process aligned with company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual planning\nDedicated resources throughout the business to support BRG efforts\nAnnual strategic leadership summit to meet with leadership, share best practices across groups, and celebrate success\nIn September, we celebrate Latinx voices around the world (corresponding with Hispanic Heritage Month in the US). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also excited to launch our latest BRG, Twitter Able (@TwitterAble), for Tweeps with disabilities and their allies.\u00c2\u00a0 \nHere are some of the amazing things that our BRGs made possible in Q2: \nTwitter Alas\u00c2\u00a0(@TwitterAlas) deepened its partnership with Techqueria, a nonprofit serving the largest community of Latinx people in tech. Together, we hosted events in New York and San Francisco to learn from Latinx leaders, network with peers, and deepen the connection between great Latinx talent and our company.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Asians\u00c2\u00a0(@TwitterAsians) hosted an event bringing the Asian tech community together in Cambridge and celebrated the release of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlinded by the Light\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a cast Q&A and advanced screenings for members in New York and San Francisco.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBlackbirds\u00c2\u00a0(@Blackbirds) launched the Blackbirds Ambassador program to expand Blackbirds leadership and support to more Twitter offices around the world. This program empowers ambassadors to locally grow Blackbirds with a dedicated budget, resources, and communication channels.\nTwitter Open\u00c2\u00a0(@TwitterOpen) conducted 40+ global events, site activations, and digital campaigns for Pride. To highlight the diversity and intersectionality of its community, Twitter Open co-hosted events around the world with Blackbirds, Twitter Alas, Twitter Asians, and Twitter Women, and marched in the Dublin and London Pride parades. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn honor of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots (#Stonewall50), Twitter Open produced a campaign spotlighting powerful voices in the LGBTQ+ community to emphasize the power of being seen and heard. It culminated in a large-scale digital out-of-home activation in Times Square for World Pride in NYC and in San Francisco during its Pride parade. #SeeUsHearUs\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Stripes\u00c2\u00a0(@TwitterStripes) is growing a partnership with Merging Vets and Players, an organization that supports former combat veterans and professional athletes \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter the uniform comes off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stripes is also partnering with Student Vets of America in an effort to align veteran talent on college campuses with our University Recruiting efforts.\nTwitter Women\u00c2\u00a0(@TwitterWomen) hosted seven events with 200+ attendees. Highlights include an \u00e2\u0080\u009cOwn Your Own Story\u00e2\u0080\u009d workshop with Olivia Christian on crafting an authentic and compelling personal brand story, and fireside chats in New York and Dublin with authors Lydia Fenet and Jean Case, and Insaff El Hassini, founder of Lean In France, respectively.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nProduct & Partnerships\nBuilding a Diverse Supply Chain As we launched this program, much of our work has focused on understanding our current spend with diverse suppliers, the resources that buyers need to be successful, and the unique value Twitter can bring to diverse suppliers and our community partners.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe developed program objectives for 2019 and beyond focused on: \nConnecting qualified diverse-owned businesses with Twitter\nEstablishing strategies that help suppliers better compete for Twitter business\u00c2\u00a0\nSetting near and long-term diverse supplier spend goals\u00c2\u00a0\nDeveloping accurate and timely diverse spend reporting\u00c2\u00a0\nPromoting Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to Supplier Inclusion\nIn Q4, we are launching a Supplier Development virtual workshop for diverse suppliers entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow to Do Business With Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u009d and hosting \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Night of Networking\u00e2\u0080\u009d event in collaboration with Twitter Women, bringing together women-owned businesses and Twitter. \nInvesting in Communities Our I&D efforts extend beyond our workforce to include underrepresented voices on our service, and the communities where our Tweeps work and live.\nThis quarter we hosted a new event series of #TwitterVoices to build trust and elevate diverse voices on the platform. Some highlights include: \nIn Cannes, we celebrated black and brown creators with a cameo by The McKinley Clover Steppers, a group of young black women from the South Bronx who use traditional step dance to advance equality.\nIn Detroit, 40 powerful voices came together to discuss investment in the city, review Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decentralized hiring strategy, and explore opportunities for partnership.\nWe also launched 10 days of virtual #TweetUps in 40 locations around the world to connect people across difference and distance. As part of the activation, we hosted #TweetUps for black #TwitterVoices in Detroit to share a meal with Afro-Brazilians in Sao Paulo. Black voices in Harlem dined with Nigerians in Lagos, and Latinx voices in LA convened across the table with Afro-Latino people in Honduras. These powerful connections and conversations enabled underrepresented communities to share what's happening in their world and discover what's happening in someone else's. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOn the five-year anniversary of the Ferguson tragedy, we met with activists who were active on the platform during the protests after the death of Michael Brown. This gave the activists a moment to sit down with Jack Dorsey (@Jack) and Twitter leadership to talk about activism on the platform moving forward, and ways to invest in the greater community.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n#TwitterforGood It is important to us to help people with barriers to employment find work that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meaningful to them and open pathways to careers in tech for underrepresented minorities.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nIn San Francisco, this year we have invested $1.6 million in local partners, donated 340+ computers to groups like Dev/Mission, Code Tenderloin and Hack the Hood, and hosted 4,800+ people at the Twitter NeighborNest (@NeighborNest), a center that lets homeless or low-income residents access technology, education, and training. \nWe also conducted 85+ volunteer projects across 26 offices, spanning the entire globe on #TwitterforGood Day. We worked with 1,300+ volunteers who provided 3,800 hours of service in close partnership with 80 community-based organizations. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next?\nPhew!

What are people talking about? How do they feel about certain topics, brands or products? Organizations have tried for a long time to uncover these types of insights through traditional research methods like surveys, focus groups and interviews.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat if you could take your research to the next level and uncover even deeper insights in real time? Today, an unprecedented number of people - including your customers, prospects, competitors and other stakeholders - are freely sharing their experiences, interests and opinions publicly, in real time, on Twitter. Twitter is the largest, publicly available, searchable archive of human-generated thought ever. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group. Are you ready to start listening?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSocial Listening: start with why (and what)\nTapping into the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group might seem daunting. The good news is that social listening platforms have the expertise, technology and tools to make it easier to get started. But, before choosing a vendor, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need to get clear on your objectives. Are you seeking brand or industry insights? Customer feedback? Crisis monitoring? Something else? And, once you have the data, what type of analysis do you need to perform? Do you want to know how your audience is feeling about a product, service, experience or issue? What about searching images for your brand or your competitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s logos?\u00c2\u00a0\nKnowing what you want will form the foundation for finding a social listening tool that best meets your needs. When you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to start evaluating vendors, keep the following three factors in mind:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n1. Data\nAccess to the relevant data can be a key differentiator among social listening platforms. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical that you understand how they are procuring their social data and from which sources. Areas to probe:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nData sources - From social channels to blogs, reviews, forums, print & TV, there are many sources of data. Which data sources does the vendor support and, of those, which ones will help you achieve your listening goals? Be ready with your own list of sources, geographic focus and topics you want to analyze.\nData providers - Is the platform accessing data via third party brokers, direct from the social networks themselves or by \u00e2\u0080\u0099scraping\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the web? If they are accessing the data directly from the source, inquire if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s via publicly available APIs, elevated access or a paid licensing agreement. This is important as changes to APIs and/or commercial agreements could impact your data access. Another important and related question is whether the data provided is being sampled or is full fidelity. Is metadata included?\u00c2\u00a0\nHistorical data - Looking for insights from the past? If yes, make sure your vendor has that capability. Does the social listening tool provide access to historical data from its various sources? If so, how far back in time, and is this full fidelity or sampled? How long does it take the vendor to access and showcase insights from historical data?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n2. Text analysis (Natural Language Processing)\nAt the heart of any social listening social listening tool is text analysis: the techniques used to understand, organize, and apply sentiment and emotion to text. Some things to consider:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow is the platform performing text analysis? This is really about a vendor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accuracy when it comes to annotating your data. Social listening tools have a variety of approaches to this, so spend some time discussing how their approach differs from others. You likely will hear acronyms like NLP, ML and AI - make sure your vendor can break these down in an understandable way.\nWhat level of detail is the text analyzed: paragraph, sentence or phrase? At what level is sentiment and emotion applied? Does the vendor guarantee a minimum accuracy, and if so, how is it measured? How is the sentiment scored, and can you override it?\nWhat languages are supported? Can they deliver the same accuracy for each language?\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n3. Customer experience\nWhen it comes to social listening platforms, your experience matters. To choose a vendor who can act as a true partner, helping you to improve your social listening maturity, consider:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIndustry expertise - Specific industries tend to have their own needs when it comes to social listening. Does the vendor understand and have experience in your industry? Ask for case studies and customer references.\nOnboarding & customer support - How will they support you to get up and running? Do they provide services to help you build advanced queries and/or validate findings? What SLAs do they offer for customer support?\nAlerting, reporting & visualizations - Does the social listening tool offer real-time alerts? Do they allow you to create customized alerts and thresholds? When it comes to reporting, does the vendor allow you to easily export charts and graphs? And do they provide display technology for offices and war rooms or command centres?\nUser experience - Can the user interface be navigated by a casual user allowing them to build queries and analyze results? Is a query builder available for those who can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use boolean logic? \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhen it comes to social listening, you have choices. Get clear on your needs and then carefully evaluate each of the vendors. Need more support?

This mission applies to every part of our service, including our advertising and promotional products.  Today, we are updating our advertising policies with respect to state media. Going forward, we will not accept advertising from state-controlled news media entities. Any affected accounts will be free to continue to use Twitter to engage in public conversation, just not our advertising products.  This is a global approach and will be enforced across our entire business.  Why are we doing this?  We want to protect healthy discourse and open conversation. To that end, we believe that there is a difference between engaging in conversation with accounts you choose to follow and the content you see from advertisers in your Twitter experience which may be from accounts you're not currently following. We have policies for both but we have higher standards for our advertisers.  This policy will not apply to taxpayer-funded entities, including independent public broadcasters.  How will we define state-controlled media in this context? This policy will apply to news media entities that are either financially or editorially controlled by the state. It has been informed by established academic and civil society leaders in this space. Sources include Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index, Freedom House, the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index, the European Journalism Centre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Media Landscapes Report, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and UNESCO's framework to assess media development and independence.  We will be making policy determinations on the basis of critical issues of media freedom and independence, such as control of editorial content, financial ownership, influence or interference over broadcasters, editors, and journalists, direct and indirect exertion of political pressure, and/or control over the production and distribution process.  This policy will not apply to entities that are solely dedicated to entertainment, sports, and travel content. However, if the content is mixed with news, it will be prohibited.  Next steps We will be notifying directly affected entities in the coming days. They will have 30 days to offboard from our advertising products, after which we will stringently enforce these policies.

A recent Twitter-sponsored study by EyeSee determined short-form (under six seconds), sound-off videos with clear branding drive significantly better ad recall and message association on mobile than linear TVC style videos. Optimal video creative and viewing experiences drive brand lift and sales. After all, when was the last time you enjoyed sitting through a minute-long ad on your phone? Never? Us, too.\u00c2\u00a0\nTo help advertisers get their video stories in front of the most valuable audience in the moments they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re most receptive, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to announce the availability of a 6-second video bid unit to advertisers globally. With this, advertisers have the security of transacting on a longer view, while still providing the optimal experience of a short-form, mobile video to their audience. Advertisers will be charged only once their ad is viewed for 6 seconds, with pixels at 50% in view (6s/50%). This bid unit is globally available on Promoted Video, In-stream Video Sponsorships, and In-stream Video Ads for assets 15 seconds or less in length.\nUnlike other channels, Twitter is not a forced-view environment\u00e2\u0080\u0094 our platform\u00e2\u0080\u0099s native video consumption tends to be shorter and more serendipitous as people discover fresh, relevant content by scrolling through their feed. Whether launching a new product or connecting a brand message with audiences across the world, you can maximize your impact with our valuable audience by running optimal creative. Today we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to provide a flexible option for advertisers who care about the completed view metric, but are ready to lean into the mobile-first paradigm and develop short-form assets optimized for in-feed viewing.\nAdvertisers across the world are embracing this new format.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe recently worked with Twitter and VMLY&R Miami to bring a new form of video communication, first-to-market in Brazil.

This 6-second video ad solution, paired with compelling creative, increased our view rate by over 22% making Dell Brazil leaders in best video result in the market.

What we are disclosing This disclosure consists of 936 accounts originating from within the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic of China (PRC). Overall, these accounts were deliberately and specifically attempting to sow political discord in Hong Kong, including undermining the legitimacy and political positions of the protest movement on the ground. Based on our intensive investigations, we have reliable evidence to support that this is a coordinated state-backed operation. Specifically, we identified large clusters of accounts behaving in a coordinated manner to amplify messages related to the Hong Kong protests.\nAs Twitter is blocked in PRC, many of these accounts accessed Twitter using VPNs. However, some accounts accessed Twitter from specific unblocked IP addresses originating in mainland China. The accounts we are sharing today represent the most active portions of this campaign; a larger, spammy network of approximately 200,000 accounts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many created following our initial suspensions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were proactively suspended before they were substantially active on the service.\nAll the accounts have been suspended for a range of violations of our platform manipulation policies, which we define as:\u00c2\u00a0\nSpam\nCoordinated activity\nFake accounts\nAttributed activity\nBan evasion\nExamples of violative content\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNext steps Covert, manipulative behaviors have no place on our service \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they violate the fundamental principles on which our company is built.

These deceptive strategies have been around for far longer than Twitter has existed. They adapt and change as the geopolitical terrain evolves worldwide and as new technologies emerge. For our part, we are committed to understanding and combating how bad-faith actors use our services.

Amid talks of declining news readership, Forbes had its most profitable year in 2018 since it became Forbes Media in 2006. Playing a major role in Forbes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 success story is their focus on social-first content and personalized engagements with millions of followers across its social channels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 particularly on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nI spoke with Emily Drewry, Senior Manager of Social Content at Forbes, for an inside look at Forbes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 approach to creating engaging content and developing a global Twitter strategy. According to Emily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter for us is like nowhere else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Check out the full interview below to learn more about how Forbes is creating relevant content for its Twitter audience.\nRachel: How many handles does Forbes have, and how do you manage them?\nEmily: Forbes has more than 30 social media accounts so we really use the calendar in Sprinklr to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming up and this enables the social team across the world to stay on the same page. The calendar has turned into a communication tool for us, to help us collaborate.\u00c2\u00a0\nMy team spends an average of 6 hours per day using Sprinklr, and we estimate our jobs would take an average 5 hours additional per day without the platform.\nRachel: What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your Twitter strategy?\u00c2\u00a0\nEmily: Forbes has many different types of coverage. We are known for longer, in-depth features but we also have a trending news initiative. For breaking news reporters, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential we get their stories out on Twitter as soon as possible. That allows them to be part of the real-time news conversation and reach a crucial, broad audience. Twitter for us is like nowhere else. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not on Twitter when a conversation is happening, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge opportunity missed.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur editor is scheduling posts throughout the day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We post probably 100 posts a day on Twitter, focusing on the most timely content that comes from Forbes.com.\u00c2\u00a0\nWith Sprinklr publishing, we schedule content on Twitter ahead of time for nights and weekends so we can still go home and be normal people. If we need to quickly change the time of the scheduled post or edit the text within it, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to redo the post in Sprinklr which is a productivity savings\u00e2\u0080\u0094 we can just drag and drop the post to the new time and make edits within the platform. News stories are coming in quickly all the time so we often have to reschedule things, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine what it would be like to manually change scheduled Twitter posts every time we wanted to make an edit. Definitely saves us a number of hours a week.\nRachel: Can you talk about your video series the #ForbesFlash?\u00c2\u00a0\nEmily: #ForbesFlash started in July 2017, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a regular recap of the biggest stories of the week. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important and valuable about it is that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not reiterating the stories that everyone has already read. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on the quality journalism that our reporters have put out for the week.\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter was the home initially for the #ForbesFlash because I found that our audience didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a visual opportunity to catch up on the most important news of the week. Because of Sprinklr reporting, I know which stories were the most popular for the week so it helps me curate the script for these videos.\u00c2\u00a0\nRachel: How have you increased the engagement of the content you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting out for Forbes across social?\u00c2\u00a0\nEmily: Based on the ability to look at all of our social content comprehensively in Sprinklr, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to optimize our social content across platforms for specifically what our audience is interested in seeing. I can use Sprinklr to filter by channels and easily understand that the content that performs best on Twitter might not be what performs best on Facebook or LinkedIn. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the real-time engagement metrics and click-through rates to help us continuously improve the effectiveness of our content.\u00c2\u00a0\nRachel: Final thoughts?\u00c2\u00a0\nEmily: Twitter is the platform we publish on the most because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great for real-time, breaking news and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where our audience spends their time. Twitter is a news aggregator for many people, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for us to join in as a voice for our readers.\nTo learn more about Sprinklr, head to partners.twitter.com.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

You would probably agree: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot harder to get value from social insights if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a clear sense of the conversations your customers are having with each other, as well as with you and other brands on social.\nWe live in a time where people are generating and accessing an extraordinary amount of data, both real-time and historical. What makes Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social data so unique is that it reflects the public conversations happening in real-time. And what makes Twitter audiences so unique is that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re made up of influencers who drive public conversation. They are receptive, relevant and looking for new experiences with a discovery mindset\u00e2\u0080\u0094not just a lean-back-and-entertain-me mindset. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Twitter is investing in new ways of understanding behind conversations and delivering meaningful data about the hundreds of millions of Tweets shared on Twitter every day.\nWhen you think about the size and breadth of the conversation on Twitter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essentially the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest focus group-- of present and historical data. Research shows 79% of Twitter users follow brands and 53% recommend products and services to friends and family. Listening to what consumers are saying can surface unique opportunities that extend beyond marketing, into customer service, sales and even product innovation. And for a brand, this allows them to provide a better customer experience, avert issues that could have a negative impact, and get valuable insights to help deliver products and services that better meet consumer needs.\nDiana Helander, head of marketing for the Twitter Developer Platform, chatted with Marketing Disrupted podcast hosts Brent Chaters and Amber Mac about the importance of social listening, and the role of Twitter Data in helping marketers solve problems.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for brands to start listening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helander says in the Marketing Disrupted podcast episode Brands On-Line: Marketing, Tech and Social Media. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBrands can help identify something newsworthy, or if needed, remediate an issue. But that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a first step. Following on from that is active engagement with those audiences, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for brand voice, marketing campaigns or customer service\u00e2\u0080\u0094engaging in that conversation and doing so in an authentic way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nBy listening first, brands can then analyze conversations and social mentions. This can provide a better understanding of what consumers are talking about, doing or buying, which is where solutions like trend analysis come into play.\nIn the podcast, Helander shares some case-study examples of how Twitter Official Partners have used social listening to drive big results and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used social insights to find fun ways to engage their audiences. For example, she discusses how Sprinklr, a Twitter Official Partner, helped Chick-fil-A use artificial intelligence to spot signs of food-borne illness from social media posts with 78% accuracy, and how social listening helped NASA spot a gap in its content strategy and successfully engage new audiences.\nCheck out Diana Helander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full interview about Twitter Data\u00e2\u0080\u0099s role in marketing on the Marketing Disrupted podcast, episode 3: \"Brands On-Line: Marketing, Tech and Social Media.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helander\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portion starts at the 29:09 mark, just after McDonald's Canada VP and CTO Lara Skripitsky.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndata\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

These conversations bring people together to debate, learn, and laugh. That said we know that distracting, irrelevant, and offensive replies can derail the discussions that people want to have. We believe people should have some control over the conversations they start.

Anyone around the world will be able to see and engage with hidden replies by tapping the grey icon that will appear.

Marketing blogs are packed to the gills with stories of high-profile brands taking stands on controversial social and cultural issues. While some brands come out on the other side triumphant, with elevated sales and glorious brand alignment, others hope the world will soon forget how they offended the masses with distasteful missteps. The few that succeed can likely thank a healthy mix of luck and calculated risk.\nTrying to insert your brand into a culture moment while being sensitive to polarizing points of view is no easy task. But by taking purpose-driven stances, brands can offer strength and steadiness during tumultuous times.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a time of immense turmoil, people are turning to brands as islands of stability.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Richard Edelman, Chairman, Edelman\nConsumers want brands that stand for something by taking a position on an issue and having a strong point of view, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumers also expect brands to contribute to their quality of life. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why successful, purpose-driven brand platforms require more than just good timing. To stand out, brands must identify a purpose and turn to data, insights and social listening to engage in relevant, genuine, open and empathetic conversations.\nAccording to a 2019 Sprout Social report, 72% of consumers expect brands to be positive contributors to society and almost half expect brands to act as leaders. An additional 45% of consumers say brands can strengthen their connection with customers by supporting a cause that is personally relevant to them.\u00c2\u00a0\nMajor brands like Patagonia, Nike, and Axe have all taken purpose driven stances on widespread cultural concerns, and the role that they play is unique and powerful. Because they each prioritized brand authenticity in the cultural moments they chose to enter, that elusive balance of luck and calculated risk has allowed them to operate as the beacons of strength and steadiness consumers say they want in the brands they trust.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMovements Start on Twitter\nWhen something happens in the world around us, for many of us,\u00c2\u00a0 our instinct is to pull out our phones and share it with others. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the moment when \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d becomes the infinitely more powerful \u00e2\u0080\u009clook at this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter represents the daily pulse of global conversations and provides the ultimate context for brands to connect with people. People on Twitter\u00c2\u00a0 are active and driving the conversations that shape culture. It is the largest searchable collection of human thought, and longest-running focus group that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been created. Movements start on Twitter because the community is active and engaged.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPatagonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dedication to the Planet\u00c2\u00a0\nOutdoor retailer Patagonia set the standard for aligning a values-driven corporate mission with its audiences\u00e2\u0080\u0099 personal values, as evidenced by a decades-long history of supporting environmental causes. When the White House announced a reduction in the size of two national parks in 2017, Patagonia responded almost immediately by turning their website into a call to action. Visitors to the site were greeted with following the message:\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe President Stole Your Land. In an illegal move, the president just reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments. This is the largest elimination of protected land in American history. Patagonia won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t step down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nDays later, Patagonia took its defiance of the current administration one step further and filed a lawsuit seeking to clarify the Antiquities Act of 1906, which states a sitting president has the power to create national monuments but not reduce them. The brand also put its money where\u00c2\u00a0 its values are by donating a $10 million tax break it received as a result of policy changes by the current administration to environmental causes.\nThough there were some calls of \u00e2\u0080\u009cnewsjacking\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Twitter in the days after Patagonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public opposition, the majority of the response was overwhelmingly positive because the brand was using its considerable platform to raise awareness about an issue its customers were passionate about. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good for business as well as perception: Patagonia\u00e2\u0080\u0094a company with $1 billion in profits in 2018\u00e2\u0080\u0094 saw a 7 percent increase in sales the week after their statement. In Patagonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, success came when their actions were deeply grounded in fulfilling their mission statement and lived up to consumer expectations.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNike Supports Kaepernick\nIn 2016, N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat during the national anthem at a pre-season game in order to raise awareness about racism, police brutality and the oppression of people of color. The next year Kaepernick left the San Francisco 49ers and became a free agent but wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t signed by another team. In 2018, Nike made the bold move of partnering with Kaepernick on a campaign about standing up for beliefs, featuring a black-and-white photo of Kaepernick and the powerful message \u00e2\u0080\u009cBelieve in something even if it means sacrificing everything. #Justdoit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn 24 hours, the post garnered more Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u009clikes\u00e2\u0080\u009d than former U.S. President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement of his second term, and twice as many views on Twitter than any other platform. Nike won the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarketer of the Year\u00e2\u0080\u009d title by Ad Age in 2018 for this collaboration.\nThe campaign however, was met with mixed reactions, with some Tweeting pictures of Nike purchases to show their support and others taking to Twitter to share their outrage. It even led to a trend of people setting their shoes on fire and cutting the Nike logo off of their socks. A video of flaming sneakers was viewed 11 million times on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBut despite the polarizing nature of the campaign, Nike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sales increased by 30 percent and their market-cap grew by nearly $6 billion in just a couple of weeks. Nike was able to take a calculated risk in part because the message aligned with the shared values of the brand and their audience, and it paid off.\nAxe Redefines What it Means to be Masculine\nPatagonia and Nike are both examples of brands with long histories of championing a specific set of values. But what about when a brand that realizes its values are suddenly out of sync with its audience?\nAxe, maker of men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grooming products, built its brand based on traditional views of masculinity--namely that one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value as a man is rooted in your ability to attract women. But by the mid 2010s, public opinion of how masculinity is defined and portrayed had clearly evolved.\nIn 2016, Axe took a pulse check of what was important to its audience of young men and found that perceptions of what it meant to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbe a man\u00e2\u0080\u009d were more complex than they may have seemed in the past. Rather than rehashing its \u00e2\u0080\u009csex sells\u00e2\u0080\u009d-based advertising of old, Axe responded to the cultural evolution with a campaign that put the definition of masculinity squarely in the hands of its audience. The tagline, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFind your magic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d encouraged guys to embrace what made them each unique.\nThis new campaign bucked traditional views of what it means to be a man and instead embraced a wide range of definitions, ultimately encouraging guys to be themselves in order to unlock what is memorable and special about them. In the end, the campaign had 70 percent positive sentiments across Twitter, and resulted in a 15 percent increase in purchase intent.\nAxe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign worked because it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ask anything of the audience, but rather reflected the audience\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own positive qualities back to them. It was tested and rooted in real cultural shifts and behavior.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow brands can create a framework for purpose\nAccording to Sprout Social, four out of five consumers believe society is more divided than ever before and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to brands to reignite connection. Sixty-four percent of consumers want brands to connect with them and just under half (49%) expect brands to bring people together towards a common goal.\u00c2\u00a0\nAfter years of observing brands who \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo purpose well\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discovered this formula as a framework for arriving at a unique brand purpose.\n\u00c2\u00a0Brands should ask:\nWhat fuels your business? \nWhat values guide your company?\nHow are you showing your commitment in a way that invites others to rally with you?\nDoes your brand have a right or role to be here? Does your company have a history to values that align with this topic?\nWill this stand up 10 years from now?\nAre you doing or just saying? Is your brand making a commitment that supports the purpose? Are you showing, not just telling? [SM2]\u00c2\u00a0\nBy answering these questions and drilling down to your brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true purpose, you can feel confident that your audiences will respond with passion.\nPatagonia, Nike and Axe all took calculated risks and landed big results. Each clarified its company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s values, understood where those values intersected with what their audience cared about and built experiences that supported those shared touchpoints. The result? Real, deep, authentic connections with customers.\n\u00c2\u00a0To learn more about Sprout Social, check out their profile on partners.twitter.com.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nguest posts\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

As we look to make our company reflect the diverse voices that come to Twitter every day, we are excited to announce the launch of the Twitter Engineering Apprenticeship Program.\u00c2\u00a0\nThrough this program, we hope to grow our technical workforce of next-generation leaders from nontraditional backgrounds (coding bootcamps, self-taught coders, veterans, caregivers returning to the workforce, etc.) and those underrepresented in tech (women, black, Latinx, Native American). Through our new apprenticeship program, participants will go through a one-year rotation program with full-time employment benefits. Upon completion of the program, they will graduate and join one of our engineering teams.\nWe are working to significantly grow our company and our technical workforce in the next year. This program will help us bring up-and-coming talent into our engineering and data science teams across our San Francisco, Boulder, and New York offices.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe know that great talent exists outside the traditional sourcing structures, and we need to do a better job of creating and fostering a sustainable pipeline of diverse talent. This is one step we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to do our part.\u00c2\u00a0\nDo you see yourself in this program? Come help us build the best Twitter for people around the world. Over the course of 12 months, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll participate in a rotation program within Twitter Engineering, helping build Twitter for Android, iOS, or web, working on our backend systems, or on our Data Science team. The program is designed for applicants with at least two years of any work experience and will provide hands-on experience, while pairing applicants with dedicated coaches and mentors to set you up for a successful career in engineering.\u00c2\u00a0\nApplications are now open, and will close on July 31, 2019.

The global team brings together content strategists, digital producers and influencer marketing specialists to help brands launch new products and connect to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in culture.\nOur mission is simple: to help brands design Twitter first content that moves people.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nCreator Influence and Artistry\u00c2\u00a0\nAt Twitter ArtHouse, we help curate best-in-class Creators to develop ideas and assets on behalf of brands. We look at Creators through two lenses: Influencers with broader reach and Artists with creative craft. Influencers offer brands the ability to tap into unique voices and built-in fan bases, while Artists represent the slate of illustrators, animators, and videographers who bring craft to content and start with the mobile canvas.\u00c2\u00a0\nIn terms of creative performance, we partnered with Magna and IPG Media Lab on a Twitter-sponsored study that showed that Twitter users spend 24% more time with ads** that come from Creators, as opposed to those posted directly by brands. Recall of branded creator posts also leads to 41% increased purchase intent** reinforcing the value of audience-first content.\u00c2\u00a0\nOn the Influencer front, Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leverages Influential Creators to launch new products and connect with cultural moments.

In partnership with GroupM***, we learned that compared to TV commercials, optimized videos achieve +19% in unaided recall and +6% in message association. We also found that video optimized for Twitter drives an increase of 33% (vs. non-optimized TVCs) in emotional engagement.***\u00c2\u00a0 Video editing is a quick turn solution - we can help brands turn around feed friendly assets in just a few days.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor Stitch Fix\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0098Personal Styling\u00e2\u0080\u0099 campaign, we helped optimize their existing asset to run as short form video in front of publisher content about awards season.

With hundreds of millions of global users, Twitter is the perfect place for brands to listen to their customers, learn from them and show them some love. As a recent Vulture article says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdvertising has always been integrated with culture \u00e2\u0080\u0094 mascots brought brands to life, influencers became human billboards \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but Twitter has facilitated a new sort of intimacy for brands, one in which they can blend in with people and develop their own personas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHashtags are one of the main ways that brands use Twitter to connect with customers. But, how do hashtags become popular? And, how do brands take advantage of viral hashtags?\u00c2\u00a0\nThis is the story of #PanteneOppa \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a random hashtag from a local radio station that turned Steve Aoki into a brand ambassador for Pantene. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great example of a brand seizing an opportunity to launch an organic marketing campaign, created and driven by the conversation on Twitter.\nHow #PanteneOppa Went Viral\u00c2\u00a0\nOn October 25th 2018, DJ Steve Aoki released \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaste it on Me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a song featuring the world renowned South Korean boy band BTS. In addition to holding records for best-selling albums, BTS also holds a host of social media records such as most Twitter engagements (average retweets) for a music group, thanks to their huge fan base the BTS Army. In 2018, BTS was ranked as the #1 most Tweeted about account for 2018 worldwide.\nOnly three days later on October 29th, #PanteneOPPA hashtag was born. A local radio station in Tennessee, 103.7 KISS FM, tagged Pantene in a Tweet with a gif of Steve Aoki jumping, saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey @Pantene we have your new spokesperson!

Pantene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple Tweet -- \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan we join this party?\u00e2\u0080\u009d received\u00c2\u00a0 a response from 103.7 KISS FM who mentioned BTS in their Tweet, urging Pantene to collaborate with Steve Aoki and BTS on a commercial.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOn October 30th, Steve Aoki jumped into the conversation. Steve Aoki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tweet accepting the new nickname has more than 45K likes and 20.5K retweets.\u00c2\u00a0\nAccording to Steve Aoki, who spoke with Sprinklr and Pantene on a panel at the 2019 Twitter Beach, Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, BTS fans are uniquely powerful on Twitter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re definitely young, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly organized and intelligent. If they love you, the power they have is exponential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aoki.\u00c2\u00a0\nOn October 31st, Pantene ensured BTS fans stayed involved in the Twitter conversation . The company responded to Steve Aoki\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tweet with lyrics from the BTS and Steve Aoki new song, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWaste It On Me\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a request for the BTS Army to comment with\u00c2\u00a0 #PanteneOppa commercial ideas. They also didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to mention 103.7 KISS FM in their Tweet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a nice call out to the radio station that started this conversation. In response, 103.7 KISS FM encouraged BTS fans to give Pantene some #PanteneOppa ideas. From there, #PanteneOppa was officially a viral hashtag.\u00c2\u00a0\nSprinklr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s social listening found that Pantene and 103.7 KISS FM Tweets mentioning the BTS Army and Steve Aoki drove the most engagement, leading to a huge spike in #PanteneOppa mentions on October 31st. Thousands of BTS fans responded on Twitter, creating viral #PanteneOppa memes.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThroughout the month of November, Pantene strategically kept the #PanteneOPPA conversation going with an engaging poll, hilarious Tweets (one has 16.9K likes so far) and  1-1 Tweets to fans.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPantene didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss out on the opportunity to thank 103.7 KISS FM either and on November 12th the radio station Tweeted a picture of the care package \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a handwritten note, personalized T-shirt and products \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that Pantene sent to them for all the positive buzz they created for the brand.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis engagement resulted in a spike in Twitter conversations mentioning #PanteneOPPA that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lasted through 2019.\nWhat Brands Can Learn From #PanteneOppa\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Be Natural on Twitter & Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Force Engagement. Throughout Pantene\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entire engagement on Twitter with #PanteneOppa, the company never forced the conversation. Sprinklr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform found that only two of the four spikes in hashtag mentions were driven by Tweets from Pantene, meaning that the majority of the brand love was organically created by customers.\nThis is a great example of how to create meaningful connections with customers through a social media campaign inspired by an earned engagement. As with all conversations, over time they die down and the Twitter universe moves to the next hot topic. Pantene allowed the conversation to die down just like it started \u00e2\u0080\u0093 naturally. But the connections they made and the brand voice they built remain.\n2. Tap into the fandom on Twitter. Pantene knows that the conversation about their brand is happening on Twitter. The company paid attention to the Tweets about Steve Aoki and BTS, and used this moment to effectively participate with those fans with relevant and fun content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like incorporating BTS song lyrics into their Tweets. The tone of their Tweets were like any other fan, excited and wanting to be in on the joke. The @Pantene handle had character and was funny. In only one month \u00e2\u0080\u0093 from October 28th to November 28th 2018 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sprinklr found that more than 20,000 individual BTS fans on Twitter mentioned #PanteneOppa and generated 29,943 mentions of the hashtag #PanteneOppa. Sprinklr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listening capabilities also found that the sentiment on Twitter around Pantene grew significantly in October 2018 when the #PanteneOppa hashtag went viral. This increase in sentiment can be attributed to the effective Twitter content Pantene published as a result of its deep knowledge of consumers and BTS fans.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n3. Listen to Your Customers on Twitter, Learn from Them and Show Them Love. Pantene, Steve Aoki, BTS and 103.7 KISS FM all succeeded in driving engagement around #PanteneOppa because they listened to their customers, quickly engaged with them and also created personalized engagements to one another. 51% of marketers say that access to social data (listening in real-time to conversations your brand otherwise wouldn't be privy to) is very important to overall business decision making. From listening on Twitter, they learned what would make their customers happy. They quickly turned this insight into action and showed their customers and fans some love with personalized Tweets, polls and creative images. They also knew that measurement should be more sophisticated than just looking at\u00c2\u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009clikes\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to understand the full story.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nWith the right technology like Sprinklr in place, brands can listen and authentically connect with audiences on Twitter to drive deep levels of engagement and make their customers happier.\nWant even more?

Our primary focus is on addressing the risks of offline harm, and research* shows that dehumanizing language increases that risk.\nAs we develop the Twitter Rules in response to changing behaviors and challenges with serving the public conversation, we understand the importance of considering a global perspective and thinking about how policies may impact different communities and cultures. Since 2019, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve prioritized feedback from the public, external experts, and our own teams to inform the continued development of our hateful conduct policy.\nExpanding our hateful conduct policy\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile we encourage people to express themselves freely on Twitter, abuse, harassment and hateful conduct continue to have no place on our service.\u00c2\u00a0As part of our work to make Twitter safe, our hateful conduct policy covers all protected categories. This means that we prohibit language that dehumanizes others on the basis of religion, caste, age, disability, disease, race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.\u00c2\u00a0\nWe will require Tweets like those below to be removed from Twitter when they are reported to us. We will also continue to surface potentially violative content through proactive detection and automation. If an account repeatedly breaks the Twitter Rules, we may temporarily lock or suspend the account; more on our range of enforcement options\u00c2\u00a0here.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n Our approach to addressing hateful conduct on Twitter\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Twitter Rules help set expectations for everyone on the service and are updated to keep up with evolving online behaviors, speech, and experiences we observe. In addition to applying our iterative and research-driven approach to the expansion of the Twitter Rules, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reviewed and incorporated public feedback to ensure we consider a wide range of perspectives.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nWith each update to this policy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve sought to expand our understanding of cultural nuances and ensure we are able to enforce our rules consistently. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve benefited from\u00c2\u00a0feedback from various communities and cultures who use Twitter around the globe. Consistent feedback we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received includes:\u00c2\u00a0\nClearer language \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Across languages, people believed the proposed change could be improved by providing more details, examples of violations, and explanations for when and how context is considered. We incorporated this feedback when refining this rule, and also made sure that we provided additional detail and clarity across all our rules.\u00c2\u00a0\nNarrow down what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s considered \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Respondents said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cidentifiable groups\u00e2\u0080\u009d was too broad, and they should be allowed to engage with political groups, hate groups, and other non-marginalized groups with this type of language. Many people wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccall out hate groups in any way, any time, without fear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In other instances, people wanted to be able to refer to fans, friends, and followers in endearing terms, such as \u00e2\u0080\u009ckittens\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmonsters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\u00a0\nConsistent enforcement \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Many people raised concerns about our ability to enforce our rules fairly and consistently, so we developed a longer, more in-depth training process with our teams to make sure they were better prepared when reviewing a report.\nThat said, even with these improvements, we recognize we will still make mistakes. We are committed to further strengthening both our enforcement processes and our appeals processes to correct our mistakes and prevent similar ones moving forward.\nOur trusted partners\u00c2\u00a0\nWe realize that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all the answers, so in addition to public feedback, we work in partnership with our Trust & Safety Council as well as other organizations around the world\u00c2\u00a0with deep subject matter expertise in this area. \u00c2\u00a0\nAs we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve expanded this policy, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve collaborated with civil society, academics and third-party experts to help us think about how we could appropriately address dehumanizing speech around these complex categories. For example, we've worked with partners to help us better understand the challenges we would face and to ultimately answer questions like:\u00c2\u00a0\nHow do we protect conversations people have within marginalized groups, including those using reclaimed terminology?\u00c2\u00a0\nHow do we ensure that our range of enforcement actions take context fully into account, reflect the severity of violations, and are necessary and proportionate?\nHow can \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or should \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we factor in considerations as to whether a given protected group has been historically marginalized and/or is currently being targeted into our evaluation of severity of harm?\nHow do we account for \u00e2\u0080\u009cpower dynamics\u00e2\u0080\u009d that can come into play across different groups?\u00c2\u00a0\n\"Our work in local communities helps us think critically about ways to ensure social cohesion between the diverse communities we serve, institutions, and policymakers.

Now, more than ever, businesses must track relevant conversations, influencers, competitors, customer feedback, social engagement, and crisis management.\nTwo brands at the forefront of building relationships on Twitter are NASA and Nationwide. They use Twitter in unique ways to better understand what their fans are interested in, and use that information to generate tailored content that strengthens their brand voice.

And while tapping into Twitter insights and actively listening to different audiences can uncover positive feedback and praise, it can also expose areas where people feel underserved.\nAfter auditing its Twitter audience using insights from Sprinklr, a comprehensive social suite, NASA realized that while its fans enjoyed stunning photos of space and behind-the-scenes looks into missions, there was a group of people who wanted to know what space sounded like, too. The organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in-depth Twitter listening sparked an idea about, well, listening.\nTo meet the demand, NASA incorporated space audio clips into its social media content strategy, highlighting the ominous galactic soundscapes in Tweets and giving certain followers the experiences they were missing. The sounds topped the intergalactic charts, with promotional tweets drawing up to 6,000 likes and many of the recordings themselves receiving well over a million plays on SoundCloud.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody has that little bit of childlike wonderment in them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Jason Townsend, NASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deputy social media manager. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can find that curiosity in every person out there and pull it out of them, then we can really engage with an audience that is interested in what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nNASA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter presence exemplifies social media engagement at its best.

In the past, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve allowed certain Tweets that violated our rules to remain on Twitter because they were in the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clear when and how we made those determinations. To fix that, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing a new notice that will provide additional clarity in these situations, and sharing more on when and why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use it.\nServing the public conversation includes providing the ability for anyone to talk about what matters to them; this can be especially important when engaging with government officials and political figures. By nature of their positions these leaders have outsized influence and sometimes say things that could be considered controversial or invite debate and discussion. A critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable.\nWith this in mind, there are certain cases where it may be in the public\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules. On the rare occasions when this happens, we'll place a notice \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the Tweet \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to provide additional context and clarity. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also take steps to make sure the Tweet is not algorithmically elevated on our service, to strike the right balance between enabling free expression, fostering accountability, and reducing the potential harm caused by these Tweets.\u00c2\u00a0\nWho does this apply to?\nWe will only consider applying this notice on Tweets from accounts that meet the following criteria. The account must:\nBe or represent a government/elected official, be running for public office, or be considered for a government position (i.e., next in line, awaiting confirmation, named successor to an appointed position);\nHave more than 100,000 followers; and\nBe verified.\nThat said, there are cases, such as direct threats of violence or calls to commit violence against an individual, that are unlikely to be considered in the public interest.\nWhat will the notice look like?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe notice will be immediately visible in your home timeline and across other areas like search.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHow will we decide when to use this notice?\u00c2\u00a0\nA cross-functional team including Trust and Safety, Legal, Public Policy and regional teams will determine if the Tweets are a matter of public interest based on the criteria listed above and the following considerations:\nThe immediacy and severity of potential harm from the rule violation, with an emphasis on ensuring physical safety;\nWhether preserving a Tweet will allow others to hold the government official, candidate for public office, or appointee accountable for their statements;\u00c2\u00a0\nWhether there are other sources of information about this statement available for the public to stay informed;\nIf removal would inadvertently hide context or prevent people from understanding an issue of public concern; and\nIf the Tweet provides a unique context or perspective not available elsewhere that is necessary to a broader discussion.\nYou can learn more about our decision making principles here\nIn instances where a Tweet violates our rules and our review doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find that it would be in the public interest to leave it up, we will require the account owner to remove the Tweet. Either way, this notice will make our decision-making clearer.\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat happens to the Tweet that gets this notice placed on it?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen a Tweet has this notice placed on it, it will feature less prominently on Twitter, and not appear in:\nSafe search\nTimeline when switched to Top Tweets\nLive events pages\nRecommended Tweet push notifications\u00c2\u00a0\nNotifications tab\nExplore\nLimited engagements \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Likes, Replies and Retweets will be disabled to reduce the reach of Tweets that violate our rules. Retweeting with comment (Quote Tweeting) will remain so people can share the Tweet with additional context. \nThis notice won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be applied to any Tweets sent before today and, given the conditions outlined above, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unlikely you'll encounter it often. We cannot predict the first time it will be used, but we wanted to give you more information about this new notice before you come across it on Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nOver time, public interest and how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defined on Twitter may change as we observe different types of behavior. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to evaluate how our rules and enforcement actions can be clearer and keep working to make our decision-making easier to understand.\n*Updated on October 15, 2019: This post was updated to include additional product updates.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nhealth\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

In fact, this year alone, voters have taken part in the global Twitter conversation about elections in the European Union, Australia, India, and Indonesia. We take the learnings from every election \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including the 2018 US Midterms \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and use them to improve the experience of people who use Twitter and enhance our election integrity safeguards.\u00c2\u00a0\nAs the US Democratic presidential primary debates kick off this week, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a rundown of how you can take part in the Twitter conversation and the steps we are taking to ensure you can trust the information you see.\nHow do I watch the #DemDebate on Twitter? On Wednesday and Thursday, June 24-25, starting at 9 p.m. ET, the debates will be broadcast live on Twitter in English and Spanish via @NBCNews and @TelemundoNews.\n#DemDebate is the official hashtag for the debates \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you can search for it or tap it anywhere on Twitter to find the live broadcast.\nCheck the top of your home timeline on mobile: If you follow @NBCNews or @TelemundoNews or are interested in politics, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see the live broadcast there.\nPlus, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll include a \u00e2\u0080\u0098set reminder\u00e2\u0080\u0099 button before each debate on the #DemDebate event page, which you can select to receive an alert when it starts.\nHow is Twitter prioritizing a healthy election conversation? We have a cross-functional team focused on election integrity efforts that aims to foster an environment conducive to healthy, meaningful conversation on Twitter and address threats posed by hostile foreign and domestic actors.\nNew rules Ahead of the US midterms last fall, we updated the Twitter Rules around several key issues impacting the integrity of elections across the globe. The rules address: (1) fake accounts engaged in a variety of malicious behaviors, (2) removing accounts that deliberately mimic or are intended to replace accounts we have previously suspended for violating our rules, and (3) the distribution of hacked material that contains private information or trade secrets, or could put people in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way.\nAdditionally, earlier this year, we strengthened our rules against deliberate attempts to mislead voters to now explicitly prohibit manipulating or interfering in the election process. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress voter turnout or mislead people about when, where, or how to vote.\u00c2\u00a0\nFighting spam and manipulation Communal spaces on Twitter (like search, hashtags, and trends) are the most common areas where people go to find the latest information about ongoing events and conversation outside of their home timeline and existing follower network. This is especially true during live events with a high volume of Tweets, like presidential debates.\nWe know bad-faith actors can attempt to manipulate the content in these spaces, and our existing rules and algorithms are built to stay ahead of these attempts. Our policies ban misleading, deceptive, and spammy behavior and prohibit attempts to game trends or cause unrelated Tweets to appear in search results. In addition to these existing preventative systems, we will be protecting the integrity of the conversation around key topics and trends.\u00c2\u00a0\nCampaign outreach and partnerships To date, our public policy team has met and facilitated trainings with 20 presidential campaign teams and the Democratic National Committee, Republican National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and National Republican Senatorial Committee to share information on account security, content best practices, our advertising policies, and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reporting procedures.\nWe have existing, open lines of communication with the US Department of Homeland Security, state elections directors, and the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force.\nPublic archive of information operations Last October, we launched the first archive of potential state-backed information operations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen on Twitter. It is our fundamental belief that these accounts should be made public and searchable so members of the public, governments, and researchers can investigate, learn, and build media literacy capacities for the future. We updated this public archive in January, as recently as a few weeks ago, and will continue to do so if we identify state-backed activity targeting conversations on Twitter.\nWe also produced an in-depth review of our efforts to protect the public conversation around the 2018 US Midterm Elections, which notes that what we saw was more domestic than foreign in nature.\nWhere can I find debate insights and data? Around the debates, @TwitterGov will share insights and information about how the conversation is unfolding on Twitter.

For businesses, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a powerful medium to dig deeper into what makes their audience tick and how to keep their brands top of mind for future customers. \nMost brands are already monitoring the conversation on social platforms. A retailer, for example, might use monitoring to immediately respond to customer inquiries or to like and share positive user-generated content. The ability to track direct mentions is great for any business\u00e2\u0080\u0099 engagement strategy\u00e2\u0080\u0094but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more opportunity to tap into on social than meets the eye.\nWhere companies stand to benefit the most is when they learn to listen to the conversations on social media at scale. Unlike monitoring, social listening incorporates a lot more data\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not only analyzing what people are saying about your brand, but also exploring what they say about your competitors and your industry at large. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being able to take a look at the big picture trends that shape conversations and extracting insights to apply to your social strategy and beyond.\nTo learn more about the applications of social listening and why businesses can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afford to ignore insights drawn from social data, we talked to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Head of Marketing for Data and Enterprise Solutions, Diana Helander.\nWhy do businesses today need listening to compete?\nDH: In this day and age, with more consumers using social media than ever, social listening is no longer a competitive differentiator\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a must-have. Consumers are more empowered than ever before and have higher expectations of positive experiences with brands. Through listening, brands can uncover insights about their products, business, employees, competitors, industry\u00e2\u0080\u0094and more importantly, they can use social listening to learn from and connect with their customers. Ignoring social listening is, in turn, ignoring your customers.\nPeople often think the advantages of social listening are limited to fine-tuning your social strategy. How can these insights help businesses grow beyond social?\nDH: While listening is often associated with informing social strategies, the applications of listening insights don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end there. Social listening offers something other business data does not: real-time, unsolicited customer or audience feedback. This information drives innovation and allows businesses to learn more about their audience as well as their competitors.\nWhy should leaders care about listening? Do you have any tips for team members looking to secure buy-in from leadership?\nDH: Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s executives need to be plugged into the fastest moving news cycle we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Twitter is the only way to do that. Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand reputation, customer experience, competitive advantage or crisis management, Twitter is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening around the world and is the best way to get a pulse of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with your customers. Leaders of customer-focused businesses need to empower their teams with social listening tools and strategies if they want to be at the forefront of their industries and make truly data-driven decisions.\nWhat are the most influential uses for social listening you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing brands implement today? Are there any brands doing particularly exciting things with listening insights?\nDH: Because social listening is a way to capture unsolicited customer feedback or audience engagement, its value is broadly applicable. We see brand leaders using listening to not only uncover deep market insights and identify trends, but also perform real-time campaign optimization, make critical decisions regarding product development and new product introductions, as well as identify influencers. Leading companies who invest in social listening can do so much more than simply respond to customer issues.\nVTWO, a boutique consultancy based in Australia, used social listening to help clients learn more about their target audience and to identify what types of social content sparked the most engagement among consumers. Thanks to listening, VTWO grew one of its client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter following by 229% and increased the number of Twitter messages received by 356%.\nFor brands that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t regularly use Twitter, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a misconception that Twitter listening insights won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be relevant for their brand. What would you say is the missed opportunity in these instances?\nDH: There are a couple of reasons why Twitter audiences are so valuable. Twitter reaches hundreds of millions of users around the world and contains insights on specific people, businesses, industries, trends and more. People are on Twitter to discover what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new, and over two-thirds of Twitter users influence the purchasing decisions of their friends and family.\nWhile skeptics might think social applies only to B2C businesses, social data is increasingly being used by B2B companies, particularly when it comes to financial investments. Bloomberg, for example, leverages Twitter social data to help its subscribers identify meaningful and relevant news so they can make better informed investment decisions.\nWhat are some examples of interesting or surprising insights we can glean from Twitter listening data?\nDH: While many companies monitor Twitter conversations to identify a problem (like an airline responding to customer complaints about a delayed flight), innovative companies are identifying trends and insights that drive new product development. A packaged goods company, for example, can use Twitter data to reveal changing consumer tastes for new flavors, informing the development and marketing of new beverage offerings.\nListening is also about communicating. Companies should be thinking not only about how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re listening to the conversation but also how they can engage with those conversations on Twitter and through which content formats. A Kantar/Millward Brown study found the Twitter environment was shown to be a strong platform for video retention; a higher proportion of consumers watch video straight through to the end on Twitter than on Facebook or Instagram.\nWhat is the biggest mistake you see social and digital teams making when it comes to incorporating listening into their strategies?\nDH: There are two big pitfalls we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen far too often. The first is keeping social data siloed, or limiting its application and the opportunity to use that data to support a more holistic view of audiences and customers. A recent Forrester report on social media maturity points to the need for marketers to leverage this data beyond just outbound marketing and consider how it can be used across other parts of their organizations.\nThe second is listening for the sake of listening instead of listening to support existing business goals. Many brands we talk to know they have to \u00e2\u0080\u0098listen to social media\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but they fail to set goals beyond just \u00e2\u0080\u0098listen\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Successful listening starts with existing business initiatives, like improving customer feedback or managing a PR crisis, and incorporating social insights to support those goals and processes.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n \u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nListening today pays dividends tomorrow\nHelander said it best when describing the significance of listening: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIgnoring social listening is, in turn, ignoring your customers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Without social listening, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult (and pretty expensive) for businesses to know how people truly feel about their brand and in turn, they miss out on valuable customer insights that can serve as a competitive advantage.\nWhen brands begin to listen\u00e2\u0080\u0094and not just for the sake of listening\u00e2\u0080\u0094they have an opportunity to analyze honest customer feedback and get a real-time pulse on the state of the industry. With the right tools and a little bit of patience, businesses can turn social chit chat into powerful insights to fuel long-term strategies.\nTo learn more about Sprout Social, check out their profile on partners.twitter.com.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

Since its launch, thousands of researchers from across the globe have downloaded datasets, which contain more than 30 million Tweets and over 1 terabyte of media, using our archive to conduct their own investigations and to share their insights and independent analysis with the world. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding six additional datasets to our archive, covering coordinated, state-backed activities originating from four jurisdictions. All accounts have been removed from Twitter.\nWe believe that people and organizations with the advantages of institutional power and which consciously abuse our service are not advancing healthy discourse but are actively working to undermine it. By making this data open and accessible, we seek to empower researchers, journalists, governments, and members of the public to deepen their understanding of critical issues impacting the integrity of public conversation online, particularly around elections. This transparency is core to our mission.\nToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosures\nIran (4,779 accounts) The below account sets all originated in Iran, and we believe all are associated with \u00e2\u0080\u0094 or directly backed by \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Iranian government. However, the signals and behaviors of each set were individually different. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken them down accordingly:\nSet one (1,666 accounts): We removed more than 1,600 accounts originating in Iran. Cumulatively, these accounts Tweeted nearly 2 million times. They Tweeted global news content, often with an angle that benefited the diplomatic and geostrategic views of the Iranian state. Platform manipulation is a violation of the Twitter Rules.\nSet two (248 accounts): In addition to the 1,600 accounts listed above, we took action on a second set of more than 200 accounts originating in Iran which were more directly engaged with discussions related to Israel specifically.\nSet three (2,865 accounts): Recently, we discussed an action to remove more than 2,800 accounts originating in Iran. These accounts employed a range of false personas to target conversations about political and social issues in Iran and globally.\nRussia (4 accounts) As part of our ongoing investigations into activity connected with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), we removed four accounts which we believe are associated with the IRA. These removals are the result of increased information sharing between industry peers and law enforcement. For more on our removal of IRA-specific accounts around the 2016 US Presidential Election, see here.\nSpain (130 accounts) Earlier this year, we suspended 130 fake accounts originating in Spain. These accounts were directly associated with the Catalan independence movement, specifically Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. They were primarily engaged in spreading content about the Catalan Referendum. The network includes fake accounts which appear to have been created with the intent to inorganically influence the conversation in politically advantageous ways. Setting up fake accounts is a violation of the Twitter Rules,\u00c2\u00a0full stop.\nVenezuela (33 accounts) In addition to a previously disclosed domestically-focused set, this is the second time we identified accounts originating within Venezuela that were engaging in platform manipulation targeted outside of the country. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disclosure is comprised of 33 additional accounts directly connected with the previous group of 764 accounts (published to the archive in January). While there were initial indications that these accounts were associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency, our further analysis suggests that they were operated by a commercial entity originating in Venezuela. We are sharing further data on this group to update the public on our attribution efforts.\nWe also want to take this opportunity to comprehensively share our principles and process for future disclosures. Below are answers to some of the most common questions we receive regarding our handling of information operations on Twitter.\nWhat are our guiding principles in this work? We believe Twitter has a responsibility to protect the integrity of the public conversation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including through the timely disclosure of information about attempts to manipulate Twitter to influence elections and other civic conversations by foreign or domestic state-backed entities. We believe the public and research community are better informed by transparency.\nHow do we do it? Our Site Integrity team is dedicated to identifying and investigating suspected platform manipulation on Twitter, including potential state-backed activity. In partnership with teams across the company, we employ a range of open-source and proprietary signals and tools to identify when attempted coordinated manipulation may be taking place, as well as the actors responsible for it. We also partner closely with governments, law enforcement, and our peer companies to improve our understanding of the actors involved in information operations and develop a holistic strategy for addressing them.\nHow do I access the full archive of content and Tweets? The complete public archive of content and Tweets are available on our dedicated Election Integrity Hub.\nWhat is the makeup of the team at Twitter working on these issues? Teams across the company contribute to our research, analysis, and investigation efforts related to information operations. These teams include data scientists, linguists, policy analysts, political scientists, and technical experts in abuse and anti-spam issues.\nWhat policies do you enforce and how do you mitigate the risk of suppressing legitimate speech from political parties? Our policies are focused on misleading, deceptive, and spammy behavior, and are specifically intended to differentiate between coordinated manipulative behavior and legitimate speech from individuals and political parties. The policies we enforce most frequently in this context include:\nPlatform manipulation and spam\nCoordinated activity\nFake accounts\nAttributed activity\nDistribution of hacked materials\nBan evasion\nWe enforce these policies without regard for the specific entities involved. However, as we discuss below, our decision to disclose datasets related to these activities are impacted by our ability to definitively attribute.\nWhat are your standards for disclosure? First, as noted above, we only disclose datasets associated with coordinated malicious activity that we are able to reliably associate with state-affiliated actors. For privacy and safety reasons, we do not disclose information about individuals or accounts not affiliated with a state actor.\nSecond, given the challenges of attribution, we require clear, verifiable associations between accounts we identify and state-affiliated actors. While we enforce our rules proactively and at scale, disclosure of datasets requires additional evidence of coordinated, state-backed activity.\nFinally, we rigorously quality-check the resulting datasets in an attempt to eliminate potential false positives caused by account compromises or analytical error. Mistakes can happen, and we do our best to avoid this at every stage of our investigations. This process takes time.\nHow does Twitter decide when to disclose datasets? Timing varies. If and when we identify malicious activity on Twitter, our first priority is to enforce our rules and remove accounts engaged in attempts to manipulate the public conversation. Following these enforcements, we carry out thorough investigations of the accounts and individuals involved. This analysis can take anywhere from several days to many months \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and in some instances, subsequent enforcement actions may allow us to retrospectively attribute activity we enforced against in the past. We only disclose datasets once we have determined attribution, and once all applicable investigations have concluded. We also proactively notify law enforcement, our peers, and other relevant state agencies.\nWhy the focus only on state-affiliated actors? When we have significant evidence to indicate that state-affiliated entities are knowingly trying to manipulate and distort the public conversation, we believe it should be disclosed as a matter of public interest. People and organizations with the advantages of institutional power and which consciously abuse our service are not advancing healthy discourse but are actively working to undermine it. This is a violation of our company principles, policies, and overarching mission to serve the public discourse.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said that you challenge millions of accounts per week for engaging in platform manipulation. Why not disclose information about those? We do. Twice a year, we share information about our actions to detect and prevent platform manipulation and spam in the Twitter Transparency Report. Our goal in disclosing additional datasets related to malicious state-backed activity on Twitter specifically is to enable research that improves the public understanding of information operations. While other forms of platform manipulation and spam may at times be involved in these operations, we do not disclose specific, Tweet-level data about these activities unless they are directly associated by clear, technical indicators to a specific, attributed campaign by a state-actor. We do, however, have a public API that allows researchers to investigate a small subset of Tweets to further public awareness of the conversation on Twitter.\nWhat about research I see on Twitter and \u00e2\u0080\u0098bots\u00e2\u0080\u0099? Non-peer reviewed research using our public API can often be deeply flawed. We see a lot of commercially-driven and non-peer reviewed research that make sweeping assessments of account behaviors only using public signals, such as location (if cited), account content, how often an account Tweets, and the accounts it follows. To be clear: none of these indicators are sufficient to determine attribution to a state entity definitively. Looking for accounts that look similar to those disclosed as part of our archives is an equally flawed approach, given many of the bad actors mimic legitimate accounts to appear credible. This approach also often wrongly captures legitimate voices who share a particular political viewpoint that one disagrees with.\nWe work with thousands of signals and behaviors to inform our analysis and investigation. Furthermore, none of our preemptive work to challenge accounts for platform manipulation (up to 8-10 million accounts per week) are visible in the small sample available in our public API. Before engaging in this type of research and making these claims, ethical norms should be considered. To do otherwise does not further public knowledge but rather risks deeply undermining trust in public debate and conversation.\nFor more on our archive of information operations, please visit our dedicated site and follow the conversation at @Policy and @TwitterSafety.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\nsafety\nelections\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

With a mission of creating new possibilities through technology literacy and a love of learning, the NeighborNest provides San Francisco residents and partner organizations access to technology and critical life skills. Programs such as our Digital literacy courses, Affordable Housing workshops, Coding for Kids classes and Twitter for nonprofits allow us to work with and for the community to bridge the digital divide.\nCheck out this moment to see highlights from the last four years!\nPowered by community partners and Twitter volunteers, the NeighborNest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family-friendly environment helps to foster bright and hopeful futures for all. Since opening our doors in 2015, we've had the pleasure of hosting more than 17,000 visits from residents and community members, and conducting 4,700 hours of programming. This wouldn't have been possible without the commitment and support of over 15 partner organizations and 1,600 hours of service from Twitter volunteers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI personally am so proud of the facility and program that we have created and thrilled that this resource is available and welcoming for the homeless and at-risk families we serve, helping them to bridge the very real digital divide in a supportive and encouraging environment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d -- Erica Kisch, Executive Director, Compass Family Services\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe NeighborNest is such a well-conceived and executed contribution to helping families move out of poverty and homelessness.

Race and ethnicity data is US only, of which 80.8% of Tweeps self-identified.] \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen increases across women, black, and Latinx leadership representation. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWomen representation in technical roles increased slightly, while black and Latinx remained steady.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe anticipate a spike in the hiring of technical roles in Q3. This will unlock a significant opportunity to increase women, black, and Latinx representation. \nHiring is a critical indicator of future trends. New hire results below are expressed as a percentage of total new hires in May 2019. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAttrition data informs where we prioritize our retention efforts. The data here is shown as a percentage of total company attrition. For example, 38.7% of total attrition were women.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHere are the broader race and ethnicity breakdowns for the US.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNew diversity dashboards In March of this year, we launched a new internal dashboard that gives all Tweeps access to org-level demographic data (gender, race, leadership, and tech representation stats) at the management level. All data is based on voluntary self-ID.\nThere are drop-downs to view gender and race/ethnicity data at the Twitter level, and also at the team level (Engineering, Product, Marketing, Legal, etc). \nBy hovering over any of the columns, leadership and tech vs. non-tech representation is provided. For instance, a Tweep can select a leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name in the drop-down, select race/ethnicity, and hover over the column on the right to learn how many black employees are within that leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPay equity  In Q1 we finished an analysis of pay after our comp planning cycle.\u00c2\u00a0 We found that all of our people are paid equitably across genders, races, and ethnicities.\nOur analysis compared pay across all US-based employees, as well as pay for employees in our global offices, and included base salary, incentive compensation (where applicable), performance bonus, and equity compensation. We looked at the data across gender (globally) and race/ethnicity (US only) based on employee self-ID.\nPromotions Recently, the People team began a review of our promotion data. We are currently analyzing the results and once complete we plan on sharing our findings in Q3. We will prioritize any next steps that might be needed to ensure equity.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur data: what we learned After analyzing our data and gathering feedback from Tweeps and people on Twitter, we identified three key issues to address:\nWe have significant gaps in self-ID. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a fully accurate capture of our people and our work can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be maximized without that foundation.\nWe have been too limited in the definitions of diversity we have used. We need to expand from the\u00c2\u00a0US government definition\u00c2\u00a0of diversity and create something broader to reflect diversity of backgrounds, geography, cultures, and perspectives.\nOur data and insights are too US-centric. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a global company and every local market has diversity priorities and challenges. We have not done enough to dive into the racial diversity in offices around the world. There are legal restrictions around what data can be captured but we believe through prioritization we can find time and resources against this.\nOur data: what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing about it\nSelf-identification (self-ID) refresh  We are doing a full refresh of our self-ID process, expanding the scope of what we collect to include sexual orientation, gender identity, disabilities, and military status. We will also communicate internally to raise the visibility of its importance. We plan to update the process for our US market in June and address non-US markets in the latter half of 2019.\nNew anonymous surveys with definitions  Secondly, in Q3 we will launch an anonymous survey to all Tweeps around the world. It is an opportunity to collect even more self-ID information via survey questions.  Some categories we are considering either expanding or which will be new include: Gender; Race/Ethnicity; Sexual Orientation; Gender Identity; Military Status; Disability Status; Nationality; Family/Caregiver Status.  The self-ID refresh coupled with the anonymous survey will help us arrive at our most accurate composite of employee representation to date. We will report our findings in a future quarterly report. \nHire international-focused diversity lead  Finally, we will add an international diversity lead to our I&D team. We have begun scoping the needs of our global offices, and this role will be fully-dedicated to inclusion and diversity, market to market.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAccountability\nNew Leadership team goals and targets While we have company-level diversity targets, we are now committing to individual Leadership (\u00e2\u0080\u009cStaff\u00e2\u0080\u009d) level goals.\nIn Q3, we will set targets for women, black, and Latinx for each executive team leader and their orgs. We believe this direct accountability will help drive progress in mindset and outcomes. We will also be refreshing the org-specific A.I.R. plans (attract, include, retain) to be customized to each team\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new targets for Women, Black, and Latinx populations. These are to be completed in Q3. \nNew company performance goals for 2020 and beyond Also in the latter half of 2019, we will review how we reward our leaders that make I&D a priority within their own teams.\nDiversifying supplier base We will also be incorporating accountability into how we drive towards a more diverse set of suppliers.\nIn April, we hired our first Supplier Inclusion & Diversity Manager within the Finance team, Kristen Hickey.\nA first area of focus is women-owned businesses, and we will look to intersect with other certified diverse businesses. We recently joined the Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest certifier of women-owned businesses in the US and a leading advocate for women business owners and entrepreneurs.\nIn the latter half of 2019, the Supplier I&D team will be incorporating supplier inclusion efforts into how we buy at Twitter. We expect to define longer term objectives and key results in Q3.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHiring\nThe recruiting team has been partnering with I&D and the business on ways to generate a more diverse pipeline, while still keeping a focus on the foundational systems and process work that needs to get addressed. \u00c2\u00a0We are installing new tools and systems that will allow us to build and track talent pipelines and referrals more effectively and providing improved candidate experiences. We also expect our decentralization work will support diversity hiring efforts over time, particularly by opening up candidate pools in locations with a more diverse population. \nWe have recently hired a new head of eng recruiting with a strong background in technical and diversity recruiting and we are recruiting for a Director of Diversity Recruiting to drive efforts across all parts of the recruitment org. \u00c2\u00a0Efforts currently underway include internal batch hiring days, fast follow up on candidates from Industry/BRG events and sourcing/referral jams, pilot hiring efforts for nontraditional hires (e.g., Associate SWE program), and competitive/SWAT efforts on opportunistic hires (e.g., diverse candidates, mass layoffs in a skillset, etc.).\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 \nThis year, we will also provide more training for hiring managers and recruiters on effective diversity sourcing and eliminating bias from the process. We are also partnering closely with the People Analytics team to arrive at ways to measure diversity within our funnels. This will allow us to understand where drop-off is occurring and identify where we need to make improvements. \nWe are also moving toward implementing policies that would require hiring managers to be presented with a diverse slate of candidates for certain roles moving forward. We expect to land on any changes in Q3 and will share those details in a future report. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTraining\nOur goal is to ensure our company reflects our service by building the processes, training, and tools that underpin a healthy workplace and help Tweeps grow: \nUpcoming new programs include:\nNEW healthy conversations training: global workshops in Q2 to arm all Tweeps with the skills and tools to have authentic, respectful conversations\nNEW updated bias training: Twitter bias training in Q3 based on completion of an in-depth needs analysis to understand how to identify bias, how to reduce it, and what to do if we see it\nEXPANDED investment in female leaders: a WELead program aimed at mid-level female leaders (Level 6-7) and a new Stanford Women's Executive program aimed at senior leaders (Level 8+)\nTEST AND LEARN mentor program: Finance is piloting a new system to scale mentoring across the company so we can access and share critical skills and expertise. We will assess ability to scale this across the company for 2020.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nProduct and Partnerships\nInclusion and diversity must be reflected in the products we build, and the partnerships we forge: \nMachine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability (META) Earlier this year we created the META (Machine Learning Ethics, Transparency, and Accountability) team. Their focus includes:\nDefining and measuring fairness in our algorithmic decisions by building the necessary tooling\nEstablishing best practices for algorithmic transparency and accountability. Promoting the adoption of fairness by design, i.e., a set of fairness concerns injected at every stage of ML driven software development\nProviding the framework to understand bias in our systems and drive its adoption across Twitter\nCommunicating the latest research and Twitter specific cases of biases to our ML practitioners and the company at large\nMaintaining a healthy relationship with the research community. This includes sponsoring conferences, hosting researchers (fellowships), and more\nMETA is supported by our academic partners Professor Moritz Hardt and Professor Ben Recht (who have been retained as part-time consultants) and was funded as a strategic investment by Engineering. \nAccessibility Last year, several Tweeps formed a group called Accessibility Shepherds to help drive awareness of accessibility issues faced by those that use Twitter, as well as those that work at Twitter.\nIn recent months, the Accessibility Shepherds have taught internal classes and engaged with product teams to raise awareness and answer questions on the topic of accessibility. Our Engineering and Product teams have been working on improvements for client accessibility (iOS, Android, web). \nIn 2019, the Accessibility Shepherds will be formalizing as a Business Resource Group (BRG), developing training materials for our engineering teams, and also exploring early conversations around product enhancements that benefit this space. \nDiversity Partnerships In March, Candi Castleberry Singleton took on the new role of overseeing our Diversity Partnership Strategy & Engagement. \u00c2\u00a0The Diversity Partnership Strategy (DPS) is focused on building trust, advancing inclusivity in our industry, and diverse communities. Introductory meetings with partners have been underway. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweeps\nTweeps play a critical and active role in building an inclusive and diverse Twitter. Here are some Q1 highlights. \n#TweepTour Throughout March, April, and May our leaders have been connecting with local Tweeps and their communities on the #TweepTour. So far they have visited Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo, Detroit, Toronto, Chicago, LA, Seattle, Boulder, Mexico, Sao Paulo, and Cambridge, with many more stops planned in June.\nThe tour has been well received and a source of great learning and insights for our leaders with common themes emerging, including questions around decentralization, how we can build greater global mindset, and key insights on culture. \nBusiness Resource Groups In February, @Blackbirds executed an end-to-end plan for Black History Month which included hosting fireside chats with black leaders and creatives, welcoming guest chefs specializing in the flavors and traditions of African Diaspora, and celebrating black women throughout history via the #WallForACause event with NY-based artist Keebs. In London, Blackbirds partnered with Black Girls Book Club on a #DopeDiscussion chat and also hosted a screening with The Mother Drum about their diaspora film series.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n @TwitterWomen hosted 60+ events across 23 offices during the month of March in celebration of International Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day (March 8) and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s History Month (March in the US). Highlights included a #SheInspiresMe wall in all offices and a VIT visit from @ChelseaClinton. On our platform, there were 11.9M Tweets with the hashtag #SheInspiresMe, which activated the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbol emoji with translations in 19 languages.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n@TwitterALAS recently participated in the #TweepTour in Mexico and Brazil where there is much excitement in activating events and experiences in both countries. ALAS also hosted a three-day immersive tech experience for young women (in partnership with MindGirl by Mindot) and inked a deal to partner with Recruiting & Women of ALPFA (Association of Latino Professionals for America).\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn 2019, @TwitterAsians is focused on going global. \u00c2\u00a0Growing beyond the community which began in our North American offices, we are extremely proud to now have @TwitterAsians Leads in 12 offices worldwide including Singapore, Tokyo, Manila, Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai. \u00c2\u00a0Q1 kicked off with 15+ Lunar New Year celebrations and a march in the Chinese New Year Parade.\n@TwitterOpen co-hosted two intersectional events. The first was a Lunch & Learn co-hosted by @TwitterParents with Dr. Guy Ringler, who spoke of fertility, surrogacy and other family-building options for the LGBTQ community. The second event was a fireside chat co-hosted by @TwitterAsians with California State Assemblymember Evan Low, who made history by being the youngest openly LGBT mayor in the United States at the age of 26. The team is gearing up for an amazing Pride Month this June, complete with events and experiences across our global offices.\n@TwitterStripes participated in a number of intersections events with other BRGs including Blackbirds and Twitter Women during their affinity months. Additionally, Stripes worked closely with Twitter For Good to host various events for veterans and tech industry partners.\nBRG action plans We asked our BRGs to prioritize the problems they are facing at Twitter. We are underway with follow-up sessions and aligning on plans that address each BRGs unique needs and asks. Elements of those plans include:\nRecognizing value: ensuring the positive impact delivered each day by the BRGs is recognized and rewarded as part of our performance review process\n#notapipelineproblem: building a process through which the amazing people introduced to Twitter via BRG channels do not get \u00e2\u0080\u009clost in the shuffle\u00e2\u0080\u009d; we commit to proactively follow through and leverage this talent pool when sourcing for future roles\nEvent support: developing end-to-end playbooks and providing resources to support the BRGs with large cross-functional efforts such as Black History Month and International Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day\nAs a further step, the People leadership team has set up a recurring weekly sync with the objective of deep diving into attract and retain efforts for our women, black, and Latinx communities. This level of focus and attention is expected to set the tone and pace needed to make a real change. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Next?\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a lot of work ahead of us and will be listening to our Tweeps, and your feedback. We believe these quarterly updates will spark conversations and actions needed for change\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 at Twitter and beyond.

The Irish Tweeps set a fundraising target of \u00e2\u0082\u00ac10,000 by the end of 2019, with the funds going towards support services for those who have recently been re-housed by the Trust. For #TwitterForGood Day, the team kicked off the day by calling over 60 businesses on behalf of PMVT to enable the building of their database. Tweeps hit the streets of Dublin selling badges on behalf of PMVT which were created by our very own #CreativeNest committee. Tweeps also prepared 1,000 care kits to donate to PMVT to aid those experiencing homelessness. The Public Policy team trained more than 40 individuals from a variety of NGOs on Twitter best practices and how these can help their organisation tell its unique story. The #GreenerTwitter committee organised flower planting for the PMVT residences to brighten up their windows with some summery flower boxes. The Dublin team ended the day with leaders in the office participating in our Leadership Challenge and raising our last few pennies with a raffle with prizes sponsored by Tweeps and all money raised going to PMVT.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLondon\n@TwitterUK hosted a range of #TwitterForGood activities throughout the month of May, starting with a charity Bake Sale, which raised more than \u00c2\u00a3200 for the Rainbow Trust (@RainbowTrustCC).

From onboarding people on the platform to connecting them with relevant conversations, we leverage machine learning (ML) across a multitude of our product surface areas.\nTo continually advance the state of machine learning, inside and outside Twitter, we are building out a research group at Twitter, led by Sandeep Pandey, to focus on a few key strategic areas such as natural language processing, reinforcement learning, ML ethics, recommendation systems, and graph deep learning. \nWe are excited to announce that, to help us get there, we have acquired Fabula AI (Fabula), a London-based start-up, with a world-class team of machine learning researchers who employ graph deep learning to detect network manipulation. Graph deep learning is a novel method for applying powerful ML techniques to network-structured data. The result is the ability to analyze very large and complex datasets describing relations and interactions, and to extract signals in ways that traditional ML techniques are not capable of doing. \nThis strategic investment in graph deep learning research, technology and talent will be a key driver as we work to help people feel safe on Twitter and help them see relevant information. Specifically, by studying and understanding the Twitter graph, comprised of the millions of Tweets, Retweets and Likes shared on Twitter every day, we will be able to improve the health of the conversation, as well as products including the timeline, recommendations, the explore tab and the onboarding experience. \nFabula was founded by Michael Bronstein, Damon Mannion, Federico Monti, and Ernesto Schmitt. It is led today by co-founder and chief scientist Michael Bronstein and chief technologist Federico Monti, who began their collaboration together while at the University of Lugano, Switzerland. Bronstein is one of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading researchers in graph deep learning, and has pioneered its application in the realm of Internet companies. \n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are really excited to join the ML research team at Twitter, and work together to grow their team and capabilities. Specifically, we are looking forward to applying our graph deep learning techniques to improving the health of the conversation across the service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael Bronstein.\nOur initial focus when Fabula joins the Twitter team will be to improve the health of the conversation, with expanding applications to stop spam and abuse and other strategic priorities in the future.\nBronstein is currently the Chair in Machine Learning & Pattern Recognition at Imperial College, and will remain in that position while leading graph deep learning research at Twitter. Bronstein will be joined by long-time collaborators from academia (many current or former students) who have spent years researching advances in geometric deep learning. \nOur acquisition of Fabula builds on other investments we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in machine learning, for example, Madbits in 2014, Whetlab in 2015 and Magic Pony in 2016. Fabula's team will be joining the Twitter Cortex team of ML engineers, data scientists, and researchers. Cortex is the central ML org at Twitter with the goal to advance machine learning inside & outside Twitter. \nWe are excited to welcome the Fabula team to Twitter! \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n@TwitterEng\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nmachine learning\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an exciting, loud and engaging few weeks, where Europeans not only came out in force at polling stations, but also on Twitter.  To drive engagement across all official EU languages, we launched two special emojis for the occasion - #EP2019 and #EUelections2019. From Thursday to Sunday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when voters from 28 Member States went to the polls \u00e2\u0080\u0094 EU election-related conversations amassed an incredible 2.1 million Tweets collectively, including those using #EP2019, #EUelections2019 and #ThisTimeImVoting. Relatedly, voter turnout was way up.  Overall, since the campaign began in February, there was 6.2 million election-related Tweets, marking a\u00c2\u00a0 273% increase in Tweet volume on the previous EU elections. Twitter was the conversational platform of choice for those who wanted to engage on the issue for the 2019 EU elections. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nUnsurprisingly, Brexit-related issues attracted a huge level of conversation and engagement with over 1.5 million Tweets posted on the topic over the election weekend alone, with 221k of those using #Brexit.\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0  In terms of candidates who are front-runners for the next President of the EU Commission, most mentioned during the election weekend were @TimmermansEU, @ManfredWeber and @SkaKeller with the most frequently mentioned political parties being; European Green Party; European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The rise in Twitter conversation involving the European Green Party is one that is certainly reflective of the #GreenWave across Europe in terms of voting patterns.  Engagement was also extremely high for the #TellEurope Eurovision debate, with 2.5m views on Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s livestream of the event from the Parliament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s @Europarl_EN account. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe much-loved #DogsAtPollingStations also proved popular, with almost 22,000 Tweets between Thursday and Friday. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a snippet of what was shared: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOn Sunday, when 21 countries went to the polling stations, Europe was alight with election 2019 conversation as demonstrated by our Tweet velocity heatmap. The map shows the geographical distribution of conversation across the region, including spikes as people expressed their democratic participation in every individual Member State.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs the figures show, the depth of conversation around the #EUelections was significantly higher (273%) than the previous election cycle, highlighting how Twitter is increasingly utilized by citizens to express themselves on the issues that matter to their everyday lives. To help protect these critical online conversations, we took a number of proactive steps specific to these elections. These included establishing an elections integrity team to monitor trends and behaviours; rolling out a new tool to allow people to report deliberately misleading election-related content; and launching a political campaign ads policy to provide more insight into electioneering ads.\nIn February, we said Twitter would work diligently to ensure it would be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window into the EU election conversation. Between selfies at count centres, breaking news alerts and the intense back-and-forth of the Brexit debate, the conversation was dynamic, extraordinarily varied and most importantly, created an online town square to unite voters around key issues relevant to them. \u00c2\u00a0 \nServing and protecting the health of the public conversation continues to be Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s key priority. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue working to protect conversations on the service, particularly around election cycles, by investing in technology, developing new policies, and building meaningful partnerships to further our understanding of the political and social context within which Twitter operates.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nelections\ngovernment\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          "}

For the past seven years, our biannual Twitter Transparency Report has highlighted trends in requests made to Twitter from around the globe. Over time, we have significantly expanded the information we disclose adding metrics on platform manipulation, Twitter Rules enforcement, and our proactive efforts to eradicate terrorist content, violent extremism, and child sexual exploitation from our service.\nWe strongly believe in providing data and information that is straightforward and provides insights into the types of requests we receive from governments and others around the world. This is why we also upload legal requests directly into Lumen database, a long-term partnership with the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard. We encourage the public to explore this site to get a sense of the day-to-day queries we receive from governments and other entities around the world.\nFreedom of expression is the cornerstone of why we exist, and we hope that the larger and more granular datasets published in our Transparency Report provide you with information that can help you understand the political and social contours of how nation-states and their institutions interact with our company. We believe it is vital that the public see the demands we receive, and how we work to strike a balance between respecting local law, letting the Tweets flow, and protecting people from harm. We will continue to update our report with new data and evolve our commitment in this space, particularly around the Twitter Rules and our own enforcement.\nThe below data points highlight some of the most important and interesting trends we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed during this reporting period (July-December 2018).\nGlobal information requests (legal requests for account information):\nWe received broadly the same number of information requests (combined emergency disclosure requests and non-emergency requests for account information) compared to the previous reporting period.\nThe US submitted 6% fewer information requests than the last reporting period, with 58% fewer accounts specified. This contributed to the lower volume of accounts specified globally. Notably, the number of accounts specified worldwide decreased by 34%.\nWe have received government information requests from 86 different countries. The United States now comprises only 30% of global government information requests and 35% of all global accounts specified in the same category.\nThe second highest volume of information requests were submitted by Japan (24% of global information requests, comprising 20% of global accounts specified). Requests from the United Kingdom (13%), India (6%), Germany (6%), and France (5%) together account for 30% of all global information requests, and 29% of all global accounts specified.\nThe volume of global emergency disclosure requests (EDRs) decreased by 2% since the last reporting period. For the first time since we began reporting, the United Kingdom submitted the greatest percentage of global EDRs (33%), followed by the United States (30%).\nGlobal removal requests (legal requests for content removal):\nWe received roughly 8% fewer global legal requests to remove content, impacting approximately 2% fewer accounts, compared to the previous reporting period. However, there was an 84% increase year-over-year between 2017 and 2018.\nWe received legal requests specifying 27,283 accounts from 48 different countries, including Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan,\u00c2\u00a0Republic of North Macedonia, and Slovenia for the first time.\n74% of the total global volume of legal requests to remove content originated from only two countries: Russia and Turkey.\nRemoval of terrorist content  During this reporting period, a total of 166,513 accounts were suspended for violations related to promotion of terrorism, which is a reduction of 19% from the volume shared in the previous reporting period. Of those suspensions, 91% consisted of accounts flagged by internal, purpose-built technological tools. The trend we are observing year-on-year is a steady decrease in terrorist organizations attempting to use our service. This is due to zero-tolerance policy enforcement that has allowed us to take swift action on ban evaders and other identified forms of behavior used by terrorist entities and their affiliates. In the majority of cases, we take action at the account setup stage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 before the account even Tweets. We are encouraged by these metrics but will remain vigilant. Our goal is to stay one step ahead of emergent behaviors and new attempts to circumvent our robust approach.\nRemoval of child sexual exploitation  During this reporting period, we suspended a total of 456,989 unique accounts for violations related to child sexual exploitation, which is down 6% from the volume disclosed in the previous reporting period. Of those unique accounts suspended, 96% were surfaced by a combination of technology solutions, including PhotoDNA and internal proprietary tools. As standard and required by law, we continue to report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Alongside our other safety partners worldwide, NCMEC continue to play a critical role and we deeply value and appreciate the partnership.\nPlatform manipulation*  Proactive challenges of accounts for spammy behavior and platform manipulation have decreased by 17% in the second half of 2018 versus the first half, totalling 194 million challenges in the second half of 2018. Approximately 75% were subsequently automatically removed after failing our account challenge process. This is due to a range of factors, including our increased emphasis on detection of malicious activity at signup \u00e2\u0080\u0094 stopping bad actors from ever getting to the stage of Tweeting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and positive external trends affecting the volume of this activity targeting Twitter. Aggregate reports of these types of behavior have also decreased in the second half of 2018, suggesting that people continue to experience fewer spammy interactions on Twitter.\nNational security requests  As in past reports, Twitter is only able to publish very limited information about national security requests due to legal prohibitions that we continue to challenge in court (see here for a full update on Twitter v. Barr, our ongoing transparency litigation). At this time we are able to share information about the number of National Security Letters (NSLs) received which are no longer subject to non-disclosure orders. We believe it is much more meaningful to publish these actual numbers than reporting in the bands authorized per the USA Freedom Act.\nDuring this reporting period we notified users affected by two additional NSLs after the gag orders were lifted. As reflected in the report, non-disclosure orders for 14 total NSLs have been lifted to date. Twitter is committed to continuing to use the legal mechanism available to us to request judicial review of these gag orders. More broadly, we are also committed to arguing that indefinite non-disclosure orders are unconstitutional in both the criminal and national security contexts. We view each request for judicial review as an opportunity to strengthen the legal precedent protecting our First Amendment rights. \nTwitter Rules enforcement  Across the six Twitter Rules policy categories included in this report, 6,388 accounts were reported by known government entities compared to 5,461 reported during the last reported period, an increase of 17%. We have a global team that manages enforcement of our Rules with 24/7 coverage, in every supported language on the service. It is worth noting that the raw number of reported accounts is not a consistent indicator of the validity of the reports we receive. During our review process, we may consider whether reported content violates aspects of the Twitter Rules beyond what was initially reported. For example, content reported as a violation of our private information policy may also be a violation of our policies for hateful conduct. If the content is determined to violate any Twitter Rule, it is actioned accordingly. Not all reported accounts are found to violate the Twitter Rules, and reported accounts may be found to violate a different rule than was initially reported. We may also determine that reported content does not violate the rules at all. The volumes often fluctuate significantly based on world events, including elections, national and international media stories, and large conversational moments in social and political culture.\nLegislative changes  We produce the Twitter Transparency Report to inform the public about the actions we take and the requests we receive from governments around the world. As the public discussion about regulation increases, we believe transparency is an essential part of ensuring you \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the public \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are able to see how these laws operate. Transparency is not just the responsibility of tech companies. Governments and regulators should be transparent about their own actions, enabling people to know if content has been removed because of a decision Twitter made, or because of a government request. This transparency is essential if we are to foster an informed debate and mitigate the risk of inappropriate use of state power.\nWe encourage you to review our latest Twitter Transparency Report in depth and to follow the conversation over at @Policy.\n*A note about our previous report: We regularly review, refine, and iterate upon the data we collect and evaluate for the Twitter Transparency Report. Since we published our last report, we have moved to a different data source for tracking the number of spam and platform manipulation reports we receive from people who use Twitter. In our last report (covering January-June 2018), we shared that we received 4,020,893 spam reports. Based on our updated data source, we now believe that 3,606,533 reports the accurate number. Today we reflect these corrections as a revision to our previous report\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\npolicy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

The safety and security of the people who use Twitter is our top priority. Over the past year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve utilized the power of our service to help prevent drug misuse, curb illegal online drug sales, and promote public health information. Most importantly, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to champion those who use Twitter to build a thriving #RecoveryMovement.  In 2017 alone, 70,237 people in the United States died from drug overdoses. Nearly 70 percent of those deaths involved opioids, surpassing the number of deaths resulting from traffic accidents. Last year, US government leaders invited Twitter to collaborate on efforts to help combat the #OpioidCrisis. Twitter is committed to leveraging our resources and tools to help meet this important challenge.  DEA #TakeBackDay Twitter is once again partnering with the Drug Enforcement Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (DEA) for its Take Back Day, a biannual campaign that encourages Americans to dispose of their prescription drugs at a local drop-off site in order to prevent drug misuse. The next #TakeBackDay in the United States is on April 27.\nTwitter has re-launched a custom emoji for #TakeBackDay and is coordinating with congressional leaders and Administration officials to raise awareness for this event on the platform. Last year, launching the custom #TakeBackDay emoji and the corresponding hashtags helped to elevate the conversation with 50x the engagement compared to previous years. In fall 2018, #TakeBackDay Tweets garnered more than 1 million impressions with the help of high-profile Tweets, including one from the First Lady of the United States.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWorking to prevent drug sales online We remove any Tweets offering to sell opioids and regulated drugs. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ramped up the use of our anti-spam tools, deployed new, targeted technologies around this issue, and implemented additional internal processes to enforce the Twitter Rules regarding drug-related content.  To inform our efforts, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve consulted expert researchers from leading institutions, government officials, and law enforcement entities. This work has resulted in the removal of more than 17,000 Tweets globally since mid-2018 for violating our rules related to illegal and regulated drug sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 included in that figure is attempted credit card scams and diet pill sales, as well as related spammy behaviors.  In the next few weeks, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be updating our rules so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shorter, simpler, and easier to understand. Included in that effort will be additional clarity regarding how we treat the sale of illegal and regulated drugs on Twitter.  #RecoveryMovement According to a recent study conducted by researchers at Johns Hopkins and Harvard, 2.5 million US adults in recovery report recovery-related use of online technology and that interventions leveraging online technologies have enhanced outcomes for these individuals.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed strong partnerships with recovery researchers from leading academic institutions and advocates to shape our product and policy work. To support the people who are active in the #RecoveryMovement online, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve held events and supported on-platform engagement, including donating pro bono advertising awards through our #AdsForGood program. We invite government leaders, NGOs, advocates, and people in recovery to join us in celebrating #RecoveryMonth in September on Twitter.  Collaboration to promote public health We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hosted events at Twitter's DC office with guests including the US Surgeon General, members of Congress, Young People in Recovery President and CEO Justin Luke Riley, and Substance Use Disorders Institute Recovery Scientist Robert Ashford to discuss the opioid crisis and #RecoveryMovement.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLast year, Twitter participated in the US Food and Drug Administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (FDA) Online Opioid Summit in which we committed to taking stronger action against the availability of illegal online drug sales. We provided an update on our progress at a follow-up event at the FDA earlier this month.  Nonprofits help to share public health information, conduct important research and create communities of support, oftentimes through online services. To support their efforts, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve conducted best practices training with organizations like Lily\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Place and The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids to enhance their effectiveness on Twitter.  In November 2018, Twitter co-hosted an event with industry peers and The Center for Safe Internet Pharmacies featuring Dopesick author Beth Macy and representatives from the National Institutes of Health. We also participated in a panel discussing how the tech industry can continue to combat the opioid crisis.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn San Francisco, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re teaming up with the Saint Francis Foundation, the Harm Reduction Coalition, GLIDE, the Tenderloin Community Benefit District, and Gubbio Project \u00e2\u0080\u0094 organizations that are all working toward a multifaceted approach to address the crisis. This year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also keynoting Young People in Recovery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2019 conference and will provide training for the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chapter leaders across the country.  Our commitment continues We will continue to invest in tools and technology to improve the health of the conversation on Twitter, as well as build on our efforts with outside partners to ensure Twitter doing its part to help those with substance use disorders connect to recovery communities.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npolicy\ncrisis response\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          "}

At Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re delighted to partner with the Earth Day Network, as well as share new commitments that our company is making to help address this pressing issue.\nFrom the first Earth Day in 1970, the annual event has grown from 20 million to more than 1 billion people participating in activities around the globe. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re helping to promote a variety of campaigns on Twitter focused on increasing environmental awareness and education, as well as working to mobilize citizens around the movement.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built and launched an emoji in celebration of #EarthDay\u00c2\u00a0that highlights key campaigns people are driving on Twitter including #ClimateAction, #EarthRise, and #VoteEarth. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also donated pro bono advertising credits under our #AdsForGood program to help promote efforts leading up to Earth Day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 50th Anniversary.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs part of our commitment to making San Francisco \u00e2\u0080\u0094 where our company is headquartered \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a greener place, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve partnered with the San Francisco Parks Alliance. Today, Tweeps are volunteering to clean up and restore the habitat at Cayuga Park. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be bringing Tweeps together for volunteer initiatives in our offices around the globe as part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreat Global Clean Up\u00e2\u0080\u009d in May and #FridayForGood.  Leading up to the 50th anniversary of Earth Day in 2020, Twitter is also making new commitments, including:\nTravel: We will begin to offset our carbon emissions for regular employee travel, as well as large-scale events like #OneTeam2020 and the #TweepTour. This program works by funding green energy projects around the world, managed through Cool Effect, a climate change nonprofit.\nData Centers: Our data centers represent a significant piece of our carbon footprint. Our goal is to achieve 100% carbon-neutral power sourcing in our current data centers by the end of 2022. While we work to bring that online, we will also offset our current carbon emissions through Cool Effect.\nPlastic Use: We will minimize our use of plastic at Twitter events, as well as end the use of single-use bottles, utensils, and plates by 2020.\nRecycled Products: By year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, all Twitter offices will use 100% recycled paper products in the United States and globally by 2020.\nComposting: We will implement a new composting program in our US offices by the end of 2020, building on the leadership of the green initiatives already underway in many of our offices worldwide.\nOffice Build-Outs: We will continue to work closely with our Real Estate and Workplace team to ensure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re retrofitting and installing environmentally-friendly water faucets and achieving at least 95% \u00e2\u0080\u009cGreen Certified\u00e2\u0080\u009d status and 100% Carbon Neutral Energy in our directly-leased buildings by 2025. Our EMEA HQ in Dublin office is already powered entirely by renewable energy. To achieve this, building aspects including water consumption, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, and material selection were designed and installed in line with LEED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guidelines and metrics. The team received an award for its leadership in the city.\nHow can you participate? Start by joining the conversation using the dedicated hashtags, following the accounts mentioned here, and thinking of ways you can reduce your own carbon footprint at home and at work.\nWe believe taking these steps are important but know we have more to do to.

Last year, we shared that building a Twitter free of abuse, spam and other things that distract from the public conversation is our top priority. Since then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made strides in creating a healthier service. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing an update on our progress and previewing some changes you can expect to see in the next few months. There will always be more to do, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made meaningful progress that is important to share.\nHere is a summary of progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made, with more detail on our proactive work below:\n38% of abusive content that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enforced is surfaced proactively to our teams for review instead of relying on reports from people on Twitter.\n16% fewer abuse reports after an interaction from an account the reporter doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow.\n100,000 accounts suspended for creating new accounts after a suspension during January-March 2019 \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00e2\u0080\u0093 a 45% increase from the same time last year.\n60% faster response to appeals requests with our new in-app appeal process.\n3 times more abusive accounts suspended within 24 hours after a report compared to the same time last year.\n2.5 times more private information removed with a new, easier reporting process.\nTaking Action Without Reports\nPeople who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel safe on Twitter shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be burdened to report abuse to us. Previously, we only reviewed potentially abusive Tweets if they were reported to us. We know that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not acceptable, so earlier this year we made it a priority to take a proactive approach to abuse in addition to relying on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reports.\nThis time last year, 20% of potentially abusive content was flagged to our teams for review proactively. Today, by using technology, 38% of abusive content that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enforced is surfaced proactively for human review instead of relying on reports from people using Twitter. This encompasses a number of policies, such as abusive behavior, hateful conduct, encouraging self-harm, and threats, including those that may be violent.\nThe same technology we use to track spam, platform manipulation and other rule violations is helping us flag abusive Tweets to our team for review. With our focus on reviewing this type of content, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also expanded our teams in key areas and geographies so we can stay ahead and work quickly to keep people safe. Reports give us valuable context and a strong signal that we should review content, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve needed to do more and though still early on, this work is showing promise.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to Come\nKeeping people safe on Twitter remains our top priority, and we have more changes coming to help us work toward that goal. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some of what to expect in the coming months:\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to improve our technology to help us review content that breaks our rules faster and before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reported, specifically those who Tweet private information, threats, and other types of abuse.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make it easier for people who use Twitter to share specifics when reporting so we can take action faster, especially when it comes to protecting people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical safety.\nContext on Tweets and our enforcement is important in understanding our rules, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll add more notices within Twitter for clarity, such as if a Tweet breaks our rules but remains on the service because the content is in the public interest.\nWe are updating our rules in the next few weeks so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shorter, simpler and easier to understand.\nStarting in June, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be experimenting with ways to give people more control over their conversations by giving them an option to hide replies to their Tweets.\n We have more to do to ensure everyone feels safe on Twitter, and will keep sharing progress on @TwitterSafety.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nhealth\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

Focus groups and market research are expensive undertakings, and often they take so long they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out of date by the time anyone gets to look at them.\nTwitter data is a fantastic, real-time source of public opinion on pretty much anything, but there are millions of tweets sent every day. How do you know where to start looking?\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a simple five-minute guide for which audiences you should be identifying, how to define them, what you can discover from them, and what to do next.\nBrandwatch Audiences\nBrandwatch Audiences\u00c2\u00a0is an influencer and audience analytics platform that helps marketers identify and reach the right people.\nPowered by the full fidelity Twitter API, it allows users to study all the public tweets of any group of people in real-time.\nWhat makes Brandwatch Audiences especially useful for building meaningful personas and marketing strategies is that it can benchmark any insights against the whole of Twitter. This is critical when trying to cut through the noise to see not only what your target audience is talking about the most but also what they talk about more than anyone else.\nTo learn more about Brandwatch, check out their\u00c2\u00a0profile.\n          Ready to get started?\n        \n    Contact\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n          Related content\n        \n            Four ways Brandwatch and Co-op use Twitter across different time frames\n          \n          Read case study\n          \n          \n            Looking ahead in 2020: Twitter Data Partners weigh in\n          \n          Read case study\n          \n          \n            Are marketers missing customer signals on social?\n          \n          Read case study\n          \n          \n                X platform\n                \n                  X.com\n                \n                  Status\n                \n                  Accessibility\n                \n                  Embed a post\n                \n                  Privacy Center\n                \n                  Transparency Center\n                \n                  Download the X app\n                \n                X Corp.\n                \n                  About the company\n                \n                  Company news\n                \n                  Brand toolkit\n                \n                  Jobs and internships\n                \n                  Investors\n                \n                Help\n                \n                  Help Center\n                \n                  Using X\n                \n                  X for creators\n                \n                  Ads Help Center\n                \n                  Managing your account\n                \n                  Email Preference Center\n                \n                  Rules and policies\n                \n                  Contact us\n                \n                Developer resources\n                \n                  Developer home\n                \n                  Documentation\n                \n                  Forums\n                \n                  Communities\n                \n                  Developer blog\n                \n                  Engineering blog\n                \n                  Developer terms\n                \n                Business resources\n                \n                  Advertise\n                \n                  X for business\n                \n                  Resources and guides\n                \n                  X for marketers\n                \n                  Marketing insights\n                \n                  Brand inspiration\n                \n                  X Ads Academy\n                \n              \u00a9 2024 X Corp.\n            \n                Cookies\n              \n                Privacy\n              \n                Terms and conditions\n              \nDid someone say \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 cookies?\n  X and its partners use cookies to provide you with a better, safer and\n  faster service and to support our business.

Live on Twitter\nThis season @MLB will be giving fans a unique opportunity to vote for which players\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at-bats they want to watch live on Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0093 every day.  Each morning, @MLB will Tweet out a call for fans to choose which player will be the featured hitter that day. @MLB will then livestream every one of that player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at-bats on Twitter for fans in the United States. This is scheduled to debut on Opening Day - Thursday, March 28 - and continue throughout the regular season.  In addition, @MLB will broadcast live shows on Twitter around key tentpole events on the Major League Baseball calendar, including the London Series, Home Run Derby, All-Star Game from Cleveland, trade deadline, and the Postseason.  Highlights of every home run  For the first time this year, @MLB will post highlights of each and every home run hit during the season on Twitter, including capturing some of those in a specially-curated nightly video montage.  MLB also will once again make near real-time game video highlights available for fans moments after they happen on the field from @MLB on Twitter, offering additional ways to follow all of the baseball action at home or on the go. Spanish-language highlights also will be available from @LasMayores, MLB\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official Spanish-language account, throughout 2019.

It has contributed to the democratisation of access to news and events in innovative and dynamic ways. Every single person has the potential to tell the world what's happening in their village, their town, their city, and their community. There are fewer barriers to full participation in the global conversation.\nWhile we firmly believe in the power of open, public conversation, the speed of the Internet presents unique challenges around media literacy and information quality. Building public capacities to analyse and discern what is and is not quality material is vital. As the European Commission says, a high level of media literacy is a key factor to enable citizens to make informed decisions in the digital age.\nThis week marks the first ever #EUMediaLiteracyWeek, a new initiative driven by the Commission to promote skills required to navigate an increasingly complex information environment. Twitter is pleased to play its part in supporting and celebrating this important event.\nWhat we're doing across the EU\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information. Journalists, experts and engaged citizens tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds. However, we do not rely on user interaction alone.\nAs part of our work improving the health of the public conversation, we are focusing on product, policy and enforcement innovations to address the behaviours which detract from that conversation. We\u00c2\u00a0have updated and expanded our Rules to better reflect how we identify fake accounts, and continue to aggressively address malicious automation and other forms of platform manipulation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also signed the EU Code of Conduct on Disinformation with industry partners, and we are sponsoring and contributing to media literacy initiatives in many countries around the world, including in Europe. Here are some examples:\nIreland (EMEA HQ)\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supporting the #BeMediaSmart campaign run by the Media Literacy Network, an initiative of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. This campaign plays on how conscious we are of where our food comes from and asks that we give the same consideration to the sources of media we consume. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be amplifying the reach of this campaign by supporting nonprofit partners with Ads for Good grants. Partners include the National Youth Council of Ireland, the National Adult Literacy Agency, and Webwise.

Last week, we hosted secondary school students from across Dublin who participated in the School Digital Champions programme, an initiative of the Department of Communications, Climate Action, and Environment. We\u00c2\u00a0talked\u00c2\u00a0to them about digital citizenship and the increasing importance of media literacy skills.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFrance\nWe are partnering with CLEMI (@LeCLEMI) - the Liaison Center for News Media and Education. We will be highlighting their students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 work from @TwitterFrance and, later this month, we will host 60 students in the Paris office to discuss the representation of women in sport by analysing Tweets from various sources. At the event, we will be joined by a sports journalist, a teacher, and an Olympic basketball player.\nBrussels\nLast week, we participated in an event for platforms to highlight media literacy initiatives, as well as the implementation of the AVMSD and how it can have a positive impact on media literacy capacities.\nUK\nWe have awarded Ads for Good grants to some of our closest nonprofit partners. Shout Out UK runs political and media literacy programmes in schools and colleges and will amplify their Media Minded content with this Twitter campaign. Bite the Ballot will reach out to young people on the service and survey them on their civic literacy. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be running a Tea, Toast and Tweeting session to support senior citizens in their use of Twitter.\nGlobal UNESCO partnership\nTwitter is delighted to have a fruitful partnership with UNESCO, which includes media and information literacy. Later this year, we will publish a co-branded educational resource, Teaching and Learning with Twitter, which includes expert guidance from UNESCO on media and information literacy best practices for educators of all kinds.\nIn the meantime, UNESCO publishes a great range of helpful information on media and information literacy on their MILClicks account. This includes: 13 points to help detect disinformation online; how misinformation can be spread through the use of \u00e2\u0080\u0098false experts\u00e2\u0080\u0099; why \u00e2\u0080\u0098disinformation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is preferable to \u00e2\u0080\u0098fake news\u00e2\u0080\u0099; the common traits of propaganda; and some helpful tips on phishing and monitoring your cookie trail.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNo single actor, organisation or institution has the capacity to enhance media literacy skills across Europe.

Our company must reflect the people we serve \u00e2\u0080\u0093 every community and all voices.\nLast year, we set two year diversity targets, prioritizing the populations that have historically been underrepresented in tech and at Twitter: Women (globally), Black and Latinx (US).\nSo where are we today?\nWhen we say we want our company to reflect our service, we've got a long way to go, but we've made solid progress towards our goals.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nIncreasing workforce representation is only part of the story. In order to move the needle on diversity, we need to measure and understand our workforce holistically including hiring, attrition and retention. \nNew hire results below are expressed as a percentage of total new hires in 2018. For example, 45.7% of all new hires in 2018 were Women. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nOn attrition, these results are expressed as a percentage of total attrition in 2018. For example, 39.6% of total attrition were Women.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEach member of the leadership team has new A.I.R. (attract, retain, include) plans tailored to their orgs against these targets. With overall Women and Black representation up 1.8 and 1.1 percentage points respectively in 2018, and positive hiring and retention trends, we believe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on track to achieve our 2019 targets for both of these demographics.\nWe have a lot of work to do with our overall Latinx representation, with improvement in 2018 at just 0.5 of a percentage point. We need to retain the amazing Tweeps we have, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll focus on attracting new people. We will work closely with Twitter Alas, our Business Resource Group for Latinx employees and allies, the People team and external partners to help us close this gap with urgency.\nBeyond these three demographics, we continue to actively track and support representation across our workforce. Here are the broader breakdowns.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nMissing from this chart is sexual orientiation and gender identity because we had lower participation in our self-ID survey for this category. We believe a refresh of our self-identification efforts and a new anonymous survey will allow us to better understand and share a more accurate representation of our company moving forward. This will also put us in a position to report on representation for employees with disabilities and with military status.\nOur Business Resource Groups (Blackbirds, Twitter Alas, Twitter Asians, Twitter Open, Twitter Stripes, Twitter Women) are a critical force within the company. They tell our story through events and experiences, support our recruitment strategy, drive an inclusive culture, and ensure diversity is front and center in everything we do. This year, a new group is being formed to represent Tweeps with disabilities, as well as intersection groups to give Tweeps a safe space to discuss issues that matter to them.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhat comes next?\nWhen sharing details of future plans, we always want to get feedback and drive conversation. The below is a thread from Leslie Berland, our Head of People and Chief Marketing Officer. It focuses on transparency, accountability and organizational changes that we believe will set us up for a more inclusive and diverse Twitter in 2019 and beyond.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nFootnotes:\nData reported from 2018 is as of 12/31/2018 and was pulled on 1/16/2019 Previously unreported data from 2017 is as of 12/31/2017 and was pulled on 1/10/2019  \u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndiversity\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          \nIntroducing the Twitter Engineering Apprenticeship Program\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 10 July 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

This is part of our overall goal to protect the health of the public conversation on our service and to provide meaningful context around all political entities who use our advertising products.  Last May, we launched our Political Campaigning Policy in the United States to provide clear insight into how we define political content and who is advertising political content on Twitter. In conjunction, we launched the Ads Transparency Center (ATC). The ATC allows anyone across the globe to view ads that have been served on Twitter, with even more details on political campaigning ads, including ad spend and targeting demographics.  Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding our political ads policy and transparency approach to include all European Union member states, India, and Australia.  When will enforcement begin? Enforcement of this policy will begin the week commencing March 11th in these countries, after which only certified advertisers will be allowed to run political campaigning ads on our service. Political advertisers must apply now for certification and go through the every step of the process.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? Our teams will continue to build the operational and tooling support to expand our political advertising policies to other key markets throughout 2019. We strongly believe that meaningful transparency is the best path forward for all advertising products we offer, particularly those that are utilized in a political context.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nelections\nATC\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          "}

The second largest democratic exercise of its kind in the world in 2019, the European elections will have a major impact on the region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geopolitical outlook and priorities for the next five years.  Twitter is committed to serving the public conversation around this major global event. As a real-time, live service, we seek to be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window into the critical conversations happening right across Twitter between candidates, voters, journalists, political parties and groups, civil society, and electoral commissions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already working proactively to support and protect these conversations, and today we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re detailing some of the additional steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking ahead of #EUElections2019.  Expanding our political campaigning ads policy across all Member States Our political campaigning ads policy is being expanded to cover #EUElections2019, providing the general public with an additional layer of insight into who is running a political campaign ad on Twitter. The policy, which is also being expanded into India and Australia today, means that an ad endorsing a party or a candidate will be viewable in our Ads Transparency Center, where you will be able to see details such as billing information, ad spend, and impressions data per Tweet. Additionally, we will be showing demographic targeting data for the ads being served. The ads will exist indefinitely within the Transparency Center, where they are viewable by anyone in the world, regardless of whether or not they own a Twitter account.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn addition to the information being shared within the Ads Transparency Center itself, we are making it clearer who is advertising European political campaign content on Twitter by including a visual label and disclaimer information on promoted content from certified accounts. This will allow users to easily identify political campaign ads and to know who paid for them. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo qualify for the policy, candidates, organisations, and individuals seeking to advertise political campaigning content must now undergo a thorough certification process. Once proof of identity is verified, and advertisers meet our eligibility requirements, a letter with an access code will be posted to their address to confirm they are located within the EU. This will ensure that only EU-based individuals can advertise political campaign content on the service.  Enforcement of this policy will begin on 11 March, after which only certified advertisers will be allowed to run political campaigning ads on our service. Political advertisers must apply now for certification and go through every step of the process. Guidelines for political advertisers can be found here.  We will expand this policy to country-level elections in the future, as our teams continue to develop their operational and tooling support.  Cross-functional European elections team In addition to increased transparency around political ads, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also formed a high-level internal elections group to lead our electoral integrity work in the region from now until polling day. Using our proprietary-built internal tools, the team will proactively protect the integrity of regional trends, support partner escalations, and identify potential threats from malicious actors.  Cross-functional by design, the team consists of several of the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top trust and safety experts, as well as members of our site integrity, legal, engineering, data science investigations, and our public policy teams in Europe. This blend of perspectives, expertise and backgrounds is absolutely critical.  It also mirrors the model we put in place for the internal teams who directed our proactive efforts during recent elections in Germany, Sweden, Mexico, the US, and Brazil. As we move forward, we will continue with this model of bringing in additional expertise and personnel who can augment our approach, growing the experience level from one critical election to the next.  Promoting media literacy and healthy campaigning on Twitter In the coming weeks and months, our public policy team across Europe will ramp up their engagement with political parties and the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s local Member State offices to arrange Twitter trainings, distribute media literacy resources, and to promote healthy, constructive participation in the democratic process.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to identify candidates for verification, amplify campaigns that encourage voter participation and launch a special election emoji to encourage engagement and conversation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll provide updates on this work when we have more information.\nFurther recent election integrity efforts by Twitter include:\nSigning up to the EU Code of Conduct on Disinformation, and forming a global partnership with @UNESCO to promote better media literacy among citizens.\nIntroducing new policies on fake accounts and hacked materials, and updating our spam reporting flow to enable the public to provide more granular information when reporting to us.\nDonating to the @DisinfoEU, @AtlanticCouncil and @NDI, all of which are doing meaningful work on #EUElections2019.\nEmpowering independent research of foreign influence campaigns\u00c2\u00a0in places like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela to develop a shared understanding of these threats and tactics.\nAs the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window into the public conversation around #EUElections2019, Twitter is prepared to play its part in enhancing access to healthy democratic discourse.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nelections\npolicy\nATC\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

In the last year, we have made more than 70 policy, product, and process updates to build a healthier Twitter. We also took a number of steps to help people see high-quality information, strengthening our sign-up processes, account verification and the ways our data can be accessed. Some of these changes included:\nTackling issues of behaviors that detract from the public conversation on Twitter and introducing new signals, which has led to fewer abuse reports.\nIntroducing new policies to address fake accounts, attributed activity and the distribution of hacked material.\nGathering public feedback as we developed new policies. \nExpanding our team and focusing more resources on our health work, including the acquisition of Smyte.\nRolling out new notices so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to see when a Tweet was removed for breaking our rules. \nMaking Twitter safer is a job that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never complete. Nor is it a job we can do alone. On Safer Internet Day, we support our global network of safety partners by amplifying their campaigns, awarding Ads for Good grants, and hosting them in our offices for frank and robust conversations. To serve that conversation on the platform, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve launched a special emoji for the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2019, available in twelve languages to encourage conversations around a safer internet.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs we look to 2019, we know that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of work to do.

We are committed to improving the quality of information you see on Twitter, and to ensuring that content does not lead to offline harm. We will continue to make it more difficult for bad actors to create spammy or fake accounts that manipulate our platform. And we want to do all of this as transparently as possible.

The public conversation occuring on Twitter is never more important than during elections. Our service shows the world what is happening, democratizes access to information and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at its best \u00e2\u0080\u0094 provides people around the globe with insights into a diversity of perspectives on critical election issues. Any attempts to undermine the integrity of our service erode the core tenets of freedom of expression online, the value upon which our company is based. This issue affects all of us and is one that we care deeply about as individuals, both inside and outside the company.  What we learned  Partnerships matter As the internet evolves, so too do the challenges and opportunities society faces. Collaborative partnerships with peer companies, federal agencies, law enforcement, state governments, and civil society organizations make us better. Our greatest partner in making the service healthier continues to be the public who challenge us, hold us accountable, and bring potentially problematic content to our attention.  Threats change Although we identified voter suppressive content of primarily domestic origin on Election Day, we cannot assume that this will be the dominant threat going forward. Elections are coming up around the world, and our goal is to protect their integrity to the best of our ability and to take the learnings from each with us. Our role, as ever, is to do our best to stay one step ahead while remaining humble in the face of potential new challenges.\nCross-functional is key The teams that work on these issues at Twitter are truly cross-functional by design. This blend of perspectives and backgrounds is absolutely critical. We all care deeply about elections and work passionately to protect the service. From engineering to data science to legal, these enforcements and disclosures touch upon many core areas of our company. As we move forward, we will continue with this model of bringing in additional expertise and personnel who can augment our approach, growing the level of experience from one critical election to the next.  What we saw in 2018  Major voter registration drive The 2018 US midterm elections were the most Tweeted-about midterm election in history. More than 99 million Tweets were sent from the first primaries in March through Election Day. The overwhelming majority of the Tweets relating to the midterms were individuals expressing their views on issues and candidates they care about, and encouraging others to vote. Americans Tweeted to encourage neighbors, friends, family, and complete strangers to register to vote. In addition to the strong discussion we hosted on Twitter, we also collaborated with a number of non-governmental organizations to promote voter registration, civic engagement, and media literacy, including RockTheVote, Democracy Works, TurboVote Challenge, HeadCount, DoSomething, and Ballotpedia.  Domestic attempts at voter suppression In order to protect this positive conversation, we took several proactive measures to remove malicious content posted by bad-faith actors, like building new policies, having a dedicated partner escalation path, and training our teams on how to be most effective in the face of new threats. In this context, we removed content that attempted to influence an election by deterring groups of eligible voters, particularly through voter intimidation or providing false information about voting or registering to vote. The number of problematic examples was relatively small. We took action on nearly 6,000 Tweets we identified as attempted voter suppression, much of which originated here in the United States. As we prepare for elections worldwide, we remain vigilant and continue to build external partnerships, while focusing internally on effectively deploying our resources to protect election-related conversations.  Foreign information operations In contrast to 2016, we identified much less platform manipulation from bad-faith actors located abroad. That said, as part of our ongoing review we found limited operations that have the potential to be connected to sources within Iran, Venezuela, and Russia. The majority of these accounts were proactively suspended in advance of Election Day due to the increasingly robust nature of our technology and internal tooling for identifying platform manipulation. As ever, attribution is difficult and takes time and significant resourcing to properly investigate. These datasets are analyzed in the full retrospective review and we have added them all to our archive to empower further research by experts in the field.  Our commitment continues The core mission of Twitter is to serve the public conversation. It is why we exist. We must promote and maintain the health of that conversation. The people who use our service must have confidence in the integrity of the information found on the platform, especially with respect to information relevant to elections and the democratic process. We continue our efforts to address the threats posed by hostile domestic and foreign actors, and work to foster an environment conducive to healthy, meaningful conversations on our service.

It is our fundamental belief that these accounts should be made public and searchable so members of the public, governments, and researchers can investigate, learn, and build media literacy capacities for the future.  So far, this archive of accounts and content has been accessed by thousands of researchers, governments, and people interested in learning more about foreign information operations. We have already seen valuable reporting and research produced on the basis of these datasets, including by major universities and think tanks in the United States and around the world.  Today, we are adding to this archive five new account sets we found based on continued contextual and semantic analysis from our investigations teams, one of the core components in our effort to protect the integrity of our service.  Bangladesh As noted last December, working with our industry peers we identified and suspended a very small number of accounts originating from Bangladesh for engaging in coordinated platform manipulation. The Tweets were entirely in Bengali and focused on regional political themes. All of these accounts and content are now part of the archive and can be investigated and reviewed by interested parties.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIran In August 2018, we were notified by an industry peer about possible malicious activity on their service about an attempted influence campaign we identified as potentially located within Iran. After receiving information from them, we began an investigation on our service to build our understanding of these networks. As soon as we discovered malicious activity, we immediately notified law enforcement and updated the public.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSince that time, through ongoing data science analysis, we have identified and suspended 2,617 additional malicious accounts that we believe may have origins in Iran. Twitter has been in close contact with our industry peers on this matter and shared detailed information with them about the malicious accounts. This multilateral process of information-sharing will continue, enabling us and our industry peers to work together to better understand and identify malicious activity.  Russia In September 2018, Jack Dorsey testified on Capitol Hill on recent activities affiliated with the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA), disclosing that Twitter had suspended a total of 3,841 accounts. Through ongoing analyses and investigations, we continue to build on our contextual understanding of these networks of accounts to improve our ability to find and suspend this activity as quickly as possible in the future. This is particularly vital as groups such as the IRA evolve their practices in response to industry-wide suspension efforts.  Our ongoing efforts have uncovered an additional 418 accounts. We cannot render definitive attribution to the IRA for these accounts, although most appear to originate in Russia, and much of the behavior mimics the activity of prior accounts tied to the IRA. We encourage researchers and other experts to study them and to contribute to general public awareness of these activities online.  Venezuela Twitter has removed 764 accounts located in Venezuela. We are unable to definitively tie the accounts located in Venezuela to information operations of a foreign government against another country. However, these accounts are another example of a foreign campaign of spammy content focused on divisive political themes, and the behavior we uncovered is similar to that utilized by potential Russian IRA accounts. We are disclosing them out of an abundance of caution and welcome the feedback of researchers.  Additionally, we have removed 1,196 accounts located in Venezuela which appear to be engaged in a state-backed influence campaign targeting domestic audiences. We have shared information on these accounts with our industry peers, and continue to investigate malicious activity originating in Venezuela, both targeting audiences with in Venezuela and abroad.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next? As we have said, these issues are not new. Manipulation of information for national or geopolitical ends is part of human history and transcends ideological viewpoints. The medium of communication is what has changed. The behavior is against our values as a company. For our part, we are learning, evolving, and building a technological and personnel-driven approach to combating it. We hope that holistic, transparent disclosures such as this can help us all learn and build the necessary societal defenses and capacities to protect public conversation.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntransparency\nelections\ngovernment\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          "}

With world leaders, journalists, celebrities on the platform, we serve conversations that are influential and leave a lasting impact on society. It is important to us to help increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation.\nMachine Learning plays a key role in powering Twitter. From onboarding users on the platform to preparing their timeline and everything in between, a multitude of ML models help power the experience. Thus, making Twitter more healthy requires making the way we practice ML more fair, accountable and transparent.\nStudying the societal impact of machine learning is a growing area of research in which Twitter has been participating. We are a proud sponsor of the ACM FAT* 2019 conference. But we feel that this is just a start and and there is a lot more work ahead of us from both a research and a practical standpoint. We owe it to our users and society at large to improve in this area.\nToday we are proud to share a significant step in this direction -- we are partnering with researchers at UC Berkeley to establish a new research initiative focused on studying and improving the performance of ML in social systems (such as Twitter). The initiative will be lead by Professor Moritz Hardt and Professor Ben Recht.\nThe team at UC Berkeley will closely collaborate with a corresponding team inside Twitter. As a company, Twitter is able to bring data and real-world insights to the table, but by partnering with UC Berkeley we can create a research program that has the right mix of fundamental and applied research components to make a real practical impact across industry.\nToday, the consequences of exposing algorithmic decisions and machine learning models to hundreds of millions of people are poorly understood. Even less is known about how these algorithms might interact with social dynamics: people might change their behaviour in response to what the algorithms recommend to them, and as a result of this shift in behaviour the algorithm itself might change, creating a potentially self-reinforcing feedback loop. We also know that individuals or groups will seek to game or exploit our algorithms and safeguarding against this is essential.\nBy bringing together the academic expertise of UC Berkeley with our industry perspective, we are looking to do fundamental work in this nascent space and apply it to improve Twitter.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npartnerships\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

It is likely that within 25 years, none will remain. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to us all to preserve their memory; to ensure that the horrors of the past will never be repeated.  In 2017, we initiated the first ever global #WeRemember campaign for International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It asks people around the world to complete an easy, yet meaningful, task. Write the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe Remember\u00e2\u0080\u009d on a sheet of paper; take a picture of yourself holding the sign; and post it to social media with the hashtag #WeRemember. We hoped that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even if just for just a moment \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this would encourage people stop and reflect.\nOur initial goal was to reach a symbolic 16 million people \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jewish population before the Holocaust. But, to our surprise, over the past two years, we have touched nearly 1 billion people in more than 100 countries. Using social media, we have fostered a community of people who have a common goal: stand up to hate.\nSocial media platforms like Twitter have succeeded in bringing the world together in ways previous generations could never have imagined. Advances in technology have fundamentally altered the way that we consume information. Moreover, the Internet has lent a voice to those who were once voiceless. Having been born in the former Soviet Union, it astonishes me that the average citizen can now respond to a Tweet from his or her country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leader knowing that there is a real chance it will be seen.\nThe Internet is vast, and while it has connected the world and enhances our lives in so many ways, it has also exposed some dark realities. White supremacists and antisemites are now afforded access to the same platforms as the influencers that billions of young people look to for the latest in fashion and pop culture trends.\nAlthough these are serious online threats, they pale in comparison to the threats that Jewish communities around the world face to their physical security from ideological extremists. In the past few years alone, there have been violent attacks against Jews in France, Bulgaria, Belgium, Denmark, and the United States, to name just a few. The recent attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, which claimed the lives of 11 people, is just the latest example of how radicalism and ignorance can have a tragic impact.\nMuch of this rise in antisemitism can be attributed to a decline in or complete lack of Holocaust education in schools. We must find new ways to reach young people so they will be able to learn the lessons of history\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greatest tragedy. Educational seminars and remembrance events are no longer enough. Shockingly, nearly a third of all Americans and more than 4-in-10 Millennials believe that substantially less than 6 million Jews were killed (two million or fewer) during the Holocaust. Even more troubling, there were more than 40,000 concentration camps and ghettos during the Holocaust and almost half of Americans (45 percent) cannot name a single one. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThrough our #WeRemember campaign and www.AboutHolocaust.org, created in partnership with UNESCO, we are taking steps toward filling the glaring hole in Holocaust education around the world.\nA key component of the campaign is the sharing of personal stories of Holocaust survivors. Today, thanks to Twitter, we will be holding an event @TwitterNYC to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. We will hear from Toby Levy, a courageous woman who survived the Holocaust in hiding thanks to the kindness of an average citizen who stood up to the Nazis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hate.

We have also added a new section covering platform manipulation, which you can read more about below and in the report itself.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nInternet freedom and online expression\nInternet freedom and online expression remain under significant pressure and constraint, a trend we have observed across recent reports. The latest Twitter Transparency Report shows that Twitter received approximately 80% more global legal demands, impacting more than twice as many accounts compared to the previous reporting period. Similar to the last reporting period, roughly 87% of the total global volume originated from only two countries: Russia and Turkey.\nTwitter also received 10% more government information requests (combined emergency disclosure requests and non-emergency requests), which is the largest percentage increase since our July-December 2015 report.\nThe new Twitter Rules enforcement\nThe new Twitter Rules enforcement section within the Transparency Report is a significant milestone on our transparency journey. It provides data and insights into the following areas of our enforcement approach: abuse, hateful conduct, private information, child sexual exploitation, sensitive media, and violent threats.\nThese categories represent some of the most common reports that Twitter receives, and our intention is to include more categories in future reports.\nThis data does not take into account content that has been actioned using technological tools, the goal of which is to limit the reach and spread of potentially abusive content. In addition, not every report we receive is actionable. For example, we receive a large volume of false reports that bad actors have submitted in a coordinated effort to detract from our enforcement capabilities. Furthermore, many of the reports that did not fall into these core categories were actioned under other policies, such as impersonation, unlawful use, evasion of suspension, etc.\nWith each successive report, we are committed to evolving our approach to make it more comprehensive.\nProviding actionable data and insights takes time to aggregate and to make clear for the widest possible audience \u00e2\u0080\u0094 our goal with every report. As such, we are continuously working to ensure the material we provide is clear, contextual, and meaningful. We strive to improve how we accurately measure and report, and we look forward to expanding our transparency in this area as we work to improve the health of the public conversation.\nPlatform manipulation\nThis also marks the first Twitter Transparency Report in which we are publishing metrics pertaining to our actions to fight spam and other malicious forms of automation. This builds on our recent work to disclose a full database of previously removed content and accounts that had potential links to state-backed information operations.\nAs we discussed in our June 2018 blog post, we are making strong progress in this area. We challenge millions of potentially spammy accounts every month, requesting additional details, like email address and phone numbers to authenticate them. From January to June, 2018, approximately 75% of accounts challenged ultimately did not pass those challenges and were suspended.\nAt the same time, the average number of reports we received through our reporting flow continued to drop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from an average of approximately 868,349 in January to approximately 504,259 in June. These report decreases indicate the effectiveness of our proprietary built technology in proactively identifying and challenging accounts at source and at scale. We have also built a new and refined reporting flow so account holders can give us more signals to augment our proactive enforcement strategies.\nEfforts to eradicate child sexual exploitation\nTwitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 whether in Direct Message or elsewhere throughout the service. This includes media, text, illustrations, or computer-generated images. When we remove content, we immediately report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC makes reports available to the appropriate law enforcement agencies around the world to facilitate investigations and prosecutions.\nIn the reporting period of January 1, 2018, to June 30, 2018, we suspended a total of 487,363 accounts for violations related to child sexual exploitation. 97% of those accounts were proactively flagged by a combination of technology, including PhotoDNA, and other purpose-built internal proprietary tools.\nWe will continue to aggressively fight online child sexual abuse, as well as invest in the technology and tools that are essential to our zero tolerance enforcement policy. We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on these types of egregious content.\nRemoving terrorist content\nWe continue our efforts to eradicate content from our platform that violates the Twitter rule prohibiting the promotion of terrorism. We suspended a total of 205,156 accounts under this policy in the period of January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2018. Of those suspensions, 91% consisted of accounts that were proactively flagged by internal, proprietary tools. Continuing the trend we have seen for some time, the number of reports we received from governments of terrorist content decreased by 77% compared to the previous reporting period. Government reports now constitute less than 0.1% of all suspensions in the reported time period as a result of the scale of our technological approach.\nThe full Twitter Transparency Report with updated details and data covering January through June 2018 can be found here. As part of our longstanding commitment to #transparency, we will continue to evolve and expand this report, and we look forward to sharing these updates in the future.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npolicy\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

This behavior has prompted us to look deeply at the Twitter audience -- to understand what are the unique, defining characteristics of this audience given their on-platform behavior.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSo we conducted a holistic, multicountry study in 2017 to unify what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to know about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience from various studies over the\u00c2\u00a0years.\u00c2\u00b9 \nThe results were fascinating, as they were largely consistent across the globe: Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience operates in a receptive mindset when using the platform, and the audience is also highly influential across a vast array of topic categories.\nHowever, this blog post will largely focus on the findings from the US portion of the study.\n1. An audience at its most receptive on Twitter\nConsumer attention is perhaps one of the most scarce resources facing advertisers today. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no longer sufficient to simply try and reach the right audience; that audience must also be receptive for ads to be effective. For example, in 2016, we conducted research to understand what Twitter and other platforms uniquely offer their users in the UK.\u00c2\u00b2 Unsurprisingly, we found that Twitter uniquely provides its users the opportunity to discover what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world. That functional purpose translates into Twitter users operating in a different mindset when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on the platform compared to other online environments.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn particular, the act of discovery, the predominant way in which the audience uses the platform, puts them in a receptive mindset, meaning that information is stored in their long-term memory more effectively. This is particularly important for advertisers, as academic literature shows that long-term memory encoding relates closely to purchase intent.\nOur most recent audience study delved into discovery and found that Twitter users are natural explorers. Compared to the general online population:\nThey are more likely to discover new things (82% vs. 71% for the online pop.)\nThey are more open-minded (81% vs. 74%)\nThey also like to be the first\u00c2\u00a0to try new things (59% vs. 41%).\n2. Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience is valuable for its influence\nTwitter users are hugely influential. A previously Twitter-commissioned study in the UK\u00c2\u00b3 interviewed friends of Twitter users (without them knowing why their friend had been selected for the research). We found that 3 in 4 of them said that a Twitter user is the first person they look to for advice when they want to learn more about a topic, and 9 in 10 of them said they had changed their opinion on a purchase based on advice from their Twitter-using friend. Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s audience is influential far beyond Twitter, which is of great value to brands.\nIn this study, we went one step further. We wanted to understand how universal the Twitter audience influence was, beyond what we observed in the UK. More specifically, we wanted to find out whether Twitter users were influential, regardless of geography, age, gender, or topic.\nWhat we found was that Twitter users in the US (and across the globe) are also influential across the vast majority of demographics and topic category.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFurthermore, we found that Twitter users love to share content they see on Twitter, on and off the service. In fact:\n \n78% of US Twitter users like to give their opinion about things they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re knowledgeable about or interested in (vs 66% US online population)\n55% of US Twitter users share things they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen on Twitter with others offline (by showing them their phone screens)\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n3. Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s users and brands\nWhen it comes to brands, Twitter users are demanding consumers, who want quality and responsiveness, and they strongly reward brands that make the effort.\nThe study found that Twitter users are willing to pay more for quality products (66% vs. 58% for online pop.) and to save time (54% vs. 42% for online pop.).\nThey are also more brand conscious, choosing brands that fit the best with their values.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n4. So what does this all mean?\nThis study demonstrates how the Twitter audience is curious, leaned in and ultimately receptive. Combined with their influence, proclivity to share what they know, and loyalty to brands offering quality products in a way that align with their values, they are the perfect catalyst for any marketers campaign messaging.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFootnotes: \u00c2\u00b9Methodology: Research done in partnership with Kantar Media.

But its primary strength is the manner in which it has democratised information for citizens, affording them opportunities to be part of real-time conversations around major global and domestic events.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true that the increasing frequency, speed, and velocity of online information being presented to users is a remarkable technological advance, but at times it can be difficult to separate the signal from the noise.\nBuilding media literacy skills\nWe believe citizens should be empowered to develop the skills that help them critically analyse material for credibility and to ask the right questions of the information they are engaging with and sharing online.\nFor our part, we have already taken steps to help empower citizens become more media literate.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our dedicated educational resource, the Educator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide to Twitter, which raises awareness of media and information literacy among parents, educators, and academics.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also supported the efforts of many non-profits across the world who work to promote media and information literacy.\nMore recently, we reinforced our commitment to enhancing media literacy levels of people who use our platform when we signed up to the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Code of Conduct on Disinformation, along with various online platforms, social media networks, advertisers and the advertising industry.\nThe Code encourages signatories to enhance media literacy levels to better help Europeans identify online disinformation and approach online content with a critical eye.\nThe Commission will in turn encourage fact-checkers and civil society organisations to provide educational material to schools and educators and organise a European Week of Media Literacy.\nGlobal Media and Information Literacy Week 2018\nAs part of our ongoing efforts, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also very proud to partner with UNESCO to promote Global Media and Information Literacy Week 2018, which begins today and runs until October 31.\nTwitter has a long-standing, fruitful relationship with UNESCO, and this year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re particularly excited by their focus on developing a network of Media and Information Literate Cities.\nTheir vision is to nurture cities which help their citizens improve quality of life by making the most of media, information and digital tools available to them.\nMr Moez Chakchouk, UNESCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Assistant Director-General for Communication and Information, said: \"UNESCO is pleased to be partnering with Twitter to promote media and information literacy (MIL) among people in cities and communities around the world.\n\"Media and Information Literacy is key to empowering citizens with the critical thinking essential to building sustainable and smart cities. Social media platforms like Twitter have the potential to facilitate debate and foster inclusive knowledge societies.\"\nSome of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activities as part of the Global MIL Week 2018 include:\nLaunching a new hashtag #ThinkBeforeSharing with an accompanying emoji as part of a global call to action which encourages people to pause and to be mindful of the content they choose to share online\nPublishing a co-branded educational resource entitled Teaching and Learning with Twitter, an easy-to-read manual for educators of all stripes who want to unlock the benefits of Twitter as a learning tool in the classroom and at home, while receiving guidance directly from UNESCO on media and information literacy best practices.\nDistributing Ads for Good grants to 10 separate NGOs in UNESCO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media and literacy network, to help raise awareness of their work.\nDelivering a speech at MIL Week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feature conference at the Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas, Lithuania, along with speakers from the Council of Europe, the European Commission, Harvard University, the London School of Economics, the Communications University of China, the Centre for Media and Information Literacy in Kenya, and the Brazilian Institute of Information in Science and Technology, amongst a truly global gathering of expert participants.\nPartnering with the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) to support Media Literacy Week in the United States using the hashtag #MediaLitWk. US Media Literacy week will be held from November 5th until 9th and Twitter is proud to again partner with NAMLE to support media literacy education programs in the United States.\nImportant elections coming up in 2019 for the European Union, Africa, and India mean that now more than ever, citizens are turning to platforms like Twitter for information and context to inform their decision.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for this reason we are investing more heavily in resources and tools to help surface more credible content with behaviour-based signals, and tackle problematic content like spam and automation.\nOur continued and committed focus to media literacy will help supplement these efforts.\nWe cannot do this alone and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beyond one internet service. Collaboration is vital. That is why we are partnering with industry partners, regulators, educators, and parents to help build a new generation of empowered and media literate citizens.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\neducation\npolicy\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nThe Twitter NeighborNest turns four\n            \n            \n             Friday, 7 June 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          "}

One piece of feedback we've heard regularly is that it's not always clear to people when we took enforcement action or if someone deleted a Tweet on their own. Starting today, we're adding new notices to make it easier to see when we've taken enforcement action on a Tweet.\n Now, once we've required a Tweet to be deleted, we will display a notice stating that the Tweet is unavailable because it violated the Twitter Rules along with a link to the Rules and an article that provides more detail on how we enforce our rules. This notice will be displayed on both the account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile and the specific Tweet for 14 days after the Tweet is deleted.

We had previously disclosed these activities, but are now releasing substantially more information about them to enable independent academic research and investigation.\nThis is the continuation of our overarching mission to serve the public conversation.\nWhy are we doing this?\nEarlier this year, we committed to the United States Congress and the public to provide regular updates and information regarding our investigation into foreign interference in political conversations on Twitter. Since that time, we have shared examples of these types of content posted on Twitter by the Internet Research Agency (IRA) and provided the public with a direct notice if they interacted with these accounts. In August, we also disclosed details of another attempted influence campaign we identified as potentially located within Iran.\nIn line with our strong principles of transparency and with the goal of improving understanding of foreign influence and information campaigns, we are releasing the full, comprehensive archives of the Tweets and media that are connected with these two previously disclosed and potentially state-backed operations on our service. We are making this data available with the goal of encouraging open research and investigation of these behaviors from researchers and academics around the world.\nThese large datasets comprise 3,841* accounts affiliated with the IRA, originating in Russia, and 770 other accounts, potentially originating in Iran. They include more than 10 million Tweets and more than 2 million images, GIFs, videos, and Periscope broadcasts, including the earliest on-Twitter activity from accounts connected with these campaigns, dating back to 2009.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nIt is clear that information operations and coordinated inauthentic behavior will not cease. These types of tactics have been around for far longer than Twitter has existed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they will adapt and change as the geopolitical terrain evolves worldwide and as new technologies emerge. For our part, we are committed to understanding how bad-faith actors use our services. We will continue to proactively combat nefarious attempts to undermine the integrity of Twitter, while partnering with civil society, government, our industry peers, and researchers to improve our collective understanding of coordinated attempts to interfere in the public conversation. Our dedicated site integrity team, in partnership with a diverse range of committed organizations and personnel across the company, continue to invest heavily in this area. We are constantly seeking to improve our own ability to detect, understand, and neutralize these campaigns as quickly and robustly as technically possible.\nIndependent analysis of this activity by researchers is a key step toward promoting shared understanding of these threats. To support this effort, we have provided early access to a small group of researchers with specific expertise in these issues. Working with law enforcement and the authorities will always be our first priority, but we strongly believe that this level of transparency can enhance the health of the public conversation on the internet. This is our singular mission.\nTo learn more about what is included and how researchers can download the datasets, visit our dedicated Elections Integrity Hub. \u00c2\u00a0\n*In this case, we initially misidentified 228 accounts as connected to Russia. As our investigations into their activity continued, we uncovered additional information allowing us to more confidently associate them with Venezuela.\u00c2\u00a0More here.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\nelections\npolicy\nTwitter for Good\nresearch\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nCommemorating the 50th Earth Day\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 22 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          "}

Over the past year, we have expanded this capability to nearly 20 global markets, including Australia, Brazil, and Spain.\nToday, we are pleased to announce that publishers can now monetize their entire global video audience on Twitter through In-Stream Video Ads. Previously, In-Stream Video Ads were limited to the markets in which publishers are based, but in many cases, publishers have a global following. We heard feedback that they want to monetize their organic following, outside of their home country.\nWe expect this opportunity can build on the momentum publishers across the world are seeing on Twitter: Over the first half of 2018, publisher earnings for this product have more than doubled relative to the same period in 2017.\nThis new feature is garnering excitement from publishers around the globe looking to increase reach and revenue:\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAll of our brands have seen exceptional growth this year on Twitter and built massive audiences of highly-engaged fans from around the world on the platform.

We are excited about the new opportunities to connect advertising partners with our audience and bring them into the amazing stories we tell, on a global scale.\nChrista Carone\nPresident of Group Nine Media\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@ChristaCarone\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nIn-Stream Video Ads has changed how we work on Twitter daily, and now we are creating much more native video on the platform. Apart from monetizing our content, it's enabling us to reach new audiences that aren't connected with our Club. In-Stream Video Ads allows us to generate revenue, gain impact in new markets and increase our number of followers. It is also very significant that the monetized videos have a completion rate beyond the organic average.\nDidac Lee\nFC Barcelona Board Member, Digital\n\u00e2\u0080\u008e@DidacLee\u00e2\u0080\u008e\nThis is a big win for monetization against the way BuzzFeed creates global content.

As platform manipulation tactics continue to evolve, we are updating and expanding our rules to better reflect how we identify fake accounts, and what types of inauthentic activity violate our guidelines. We now may remove fake accounts engaged in a variety of emergent, malicious behaviors. Some of the factors that we will take into account when determining whether an account is fake include:\n\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 -Use of stock or stolen avatar photos\n\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 -Use of stolen or copied profile bios\n\u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0 -Use of intentionally misleading profile information, including profile location\nAttributed activity: As per the Twitter Rules, if we are able to reliably attribute an account on Twitter to an entity known to violate the Twitter Rules, we will take action on additional accounts associated with that entity. We are expanding our enforcement approach to include accounts that deliberately mimic or are intended to replace accounts we have previously suspended for violating our rules.\nDistribution of hacked materials: Our rules prohibit the distribution of hacked material that contains private information or trade secrets, or could put people in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way. We are also expanding the criteria for when we will take action on accounts which claim responsibility for a hack, which includes threats and public incentives to hack specific people and accounts. Commentary about a hack or hacked materials, such as news articles discussing a hack, are generally not considered a violation of this policy.\nDetection and enforcement\nWe have seen positive results from our investments in conversational health and information integrity:\nWe continue to enforce our rules against intentionally misleading election-related content. In August, we removed approximately 50 accounts misrepresenting themselves as members of various state Republican parties. We have also taken action on Tweets sharing media regarding elections and political issues with misleading or incorrect party affiliation information. We continue to partner closely with the RNC, DNC, and state election institutions to improve how we handle these issues.\nIn August, we removed 770 accounts engaging in coordinated behavior which appeared to originate in Iran. Our investigation into this activity continues, and we will share further updates on our findings with law enforcement, our industry peers, and the public.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur automated detections continue to identify and challenge millions of potentially spammy and automated accounts per week. In the first half of September, we challenged an average of 9.4 million accounts each week. \nAs a result of our proactive detections and enforcements, we have continued to see a decline in the average number of spam-related reports we receive from users each day \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from an average of approximately 17,000 per day in May, to approximately 16,000 per day in September.\nIn July, we introduced a new registration process for developers requesting access to our APIs, intended to prevent the registration of spammy and low quality apps. While we continue to proactively identify and remove malicious applications \u00e2\u0080\u0094 suspending, on average, approximately 30,000 applications each month as a result of these efforts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we continue to make it more difficult for these apps to operate in the first place.\nWe are continuing to roll out improvements to our proactive enforcements against common policy violations, including building new proprietary systems to identify and remove ban evaders at speed and scale.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nProduct developments\nFinally, we continue to make improvements to the Twitter product to help people stay informed and to see the best content first:\nWe heard feedback that people want an easy way to see the most recent Tweets in their home timeline. We recently updated the timeline personalization setting to allow people to select a strictly reverse-chronological experience, without recommended content and recaps. This ensures you have more control of how you experience what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on our service.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are continuing to roll out new features to show people context about accounts on Twitter. In May, we launched an election labels beta for candidates in the 2018 US midterm elections. We are also going to send candidates a message prompt to ensure they have two-factor authentication enabled on their account so it is safe and secure. \nWe are offering electoral institutions increased support via an elections-specific support portal, which is designed to ensure we receive and review critical feedback about emerging issues as quickly as possible. We will continue to expand this program ahead of the elections and will provide information about the feedback we receive in the near future.\nAs part of our civic engagement efforts, we are building conversation around the hashtag #BeAVoter with a custom emoji, sending US-based users a prompt in their home timeline with information on how to register to vote, and drawing attention to these conversations and resources through the top US trend. This trend is being promoted by @TwitterGov, which will create even more access to voter registration information, including election reminders and an absentee ballot FAQ.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nelections\ngovernment\npolicy\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nThe Twitter NeighborNest turns four\n            \n            \n             Friday, 7 June 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          "}

In the past, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve created our rules with a rigorous policy development process; it involves in-depth research and partnership with the members of our Trust and Safety Council and other experts to ensure these policies best serve every person on the service. Now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying something new by asking everyone for feedback on a policy before it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part of the Twitter Rules.\nFor the last three months, we have been developing a new policy to address dehumanizing language on Twitter. Language that makes someone less than human can have repercussions off the service, including normalizing serious violence. Some of this content falls within our hateful conduct policy (which prohibits the promotion of violence against or direct attacks or threats against other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease), but there are still Tweets many people consider to be abusive, even when they do not break our rules. Better addressing this gap is part of our work to serve a healthy public conversation.\nWith this change, we want to expand our hateful conduct policy to include content that dehumanizes others based on their membership in an identifiable group, even when the material does not include a direct target. Many scholars have examined the relationship between dehumanization and violence. For example, Susan Benesch has described dehumanizing language as a hallmark of dangerous speech, because it can make violence seem acceptable, and Herbert Kelman has posited that dehumanization can reduce the strength of restraining forces against violence.\nWe want your feedback to ensure we consider global perspectives and how this policy may impact different communities and cultures. For languages not represented here, our policy team is working closely with local non-governmental organizations and policy makers to ensure their perspectives are captured.\nBelow you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find a quick survey, which will be available until Tuesday, October 9, at 6:00am PST. Once the feedback form has closed, we will continue with our regular process, which passes through a cross-functional working group, including members of our policy development, user research, engineering, and enforcement teams. We will share some of what we learn when we update the Twitter Rules later this year.\nThis is part of our singular effort to increase the health of the public conversation on our service and we hope this gives you a better understanding of how new rules are created. We want you to be part of this process, let us know what you think in the form below.\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dehumanization Policy\nYou may not dehumanize anyone based on membership in an identifiable group, as this speech can lead to offline harm.\nDefinitions:\nDehumanization: Language that treats others as less than human. Dehumanization can occur when others are denied of human qualities (animalistic dehumanization) or when others are denied of their human nature (mechanistic dehumanization). Examples can include comparing groups to animals and viruses (animalistic), or reducing groups to a tool for some other purpose (mechanistic).\nIdentifiable group: Any group of people that can be distinguished by their shared characteristics such as their race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, serious disease, occupation, political beliefs, location, or social practices.\nExamples of dehumanization:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThank you for submitting your feedback.

The emoji will appear when people Tweet with the hashtags #WorldSuicidePreventionDay, #SuicidePrevention, #WSPD2018, and #WSPD from September 7-16 in 15 different languages.\nAt Twitter, we believe that addressing mental health requires collaboration between all stakeholders \u00e2\u0080\u0094 public, private, and not-for-profit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and we recognize that we have a role and responsibility to help ensure that people can access and receive support when they need it most.\nOne of the key ways that we do this is via a range of valued partnerships with suicide prevention and counselling services in various countries. This includes our marquee \"There is Help\" partnerships with the Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the US, the Tokyo Suicide Prevention Center in Japan, and Lifeline Korea. Today we are expanding our services to bring relevant resources to additional countries through formalized partnerships in Brazil, Australia, Hong Kong, Spain, Ireland, Germany, and the UK.\nThis service offers a prompt on Twitter, which links the user directly to valuable mental health resources to vulnerable people and encourages them to reach out and get help when they need it.\nWhen someone searches for terms associated with suicide or self-harm, the top search result is a prompt encouraging them to reach out for help. This valuable notification provides the contact details of the partner organization in their country when certain keywords are used. It is available on mobile devices and desktop in the US, Japan and Korea, and now offered on mobile in Brazil, Australia, Hong Kong, Spain, Ireland, Germany, and the UK.\nSuicide prevention remains a complex challenge but at Twitter we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that people who are struggling are seen and heard so that they can get the help they need.\nThe various communities on Twitter are a source of positive support, encouraging users who may be struggling not to self-harm to reach out for professional help. We also have a list of international resources on our website where people can go to find more information and the details of relevant organizations within their respective countries. Increasingly, we see mental health organizations offering critical services via digital channels and social media platforms that are relevant, widely used and reflective of the way society communicates today.\nWe have a reporting form for people threatening suicide or self-harm and a dedicated team who review these reports. When we receive reports that a person is threatening suicide or self-harm, we will contact the reported user and let him or her know that someone who cares about them identified that they might be at risk. We will provide the reported user with available online and hotline resources and encourage them to seek help.\nWe also provide information in our Help Center, both for people who may be experiencing thoughts of suicide and self-harm, and for people who are concerned about another Twitter user.\nWe believe \"There is Help\" and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other partnerships and initiatives in this space will make a valuable contribution to the ongoing and larger efforts required to address this serious issue.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ncommunity outreach\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

This year, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving faster towards this goal by focusing on improving Twitter for iOS, Android, and twitter.com. As part of this, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve chosen to stop supporting some other experiences. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve removed support for Twitter for Apple Watch and Twitter for Mac, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve replaced our previous Twitter for Windows app with our Progressive Web App, and today we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re removing support for some outdated developer tools.\nWe feel the best Twitter experience we can provide today is through our owned and operated Twitter for iOS and Android apps, as well as desktop and mobile twitter.com.

This means that some Twitter-like apps will not be able to function the exact same way as before. For example, instead of Tweets automatically streaming in like they once did in some third-party apps, you might need to pull to refresh like you do in Twitter-owned apps and sites. Several of the most popular apps have already made updates so that you can continue using them with minimal disruption.\nWe know some of you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this more focused approach.

However, there are several barriers to using Twitter, including slow mobile networks, expensive data plans, or lack of space on mobile devices. When building new products, we want to make sure what we create allows people to have the best possible experience, no matter where they are.\nAs a result of this, last year, we released Twitter Lite as an app in the Google Play Store, which minimizes data usage, loads quickly on slower networks and takes up less space on your device. Today we are excited to announce we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding to 21 more countries including Argentina, Belarus, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Romania, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, Uruguay, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. Now, Twitter Lite will be available in the Google Play Store in more than 45 countries.\nHere are a few ways Twitter Lite makes Twitter more accessible, fast, and data-friendly for you:\nData saver: We want to make sure that Twitter Lite is accessible to people with data, bandwidth, and device constraints. By enabling Data saver, you can control which images and videos load on your phone. You can still load all this content at any time by hitting \u00e2\u0080\u009cLoad image\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cLoad video\u00e2\u0080\u009d, helping you save money and data in real time.\nBuilt for 2G and 3G networks: At an install size of 3MB, Twitter Lite saves data and space, and loads quickly on unreliable networks. While using the app on 2G or 3G, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll notice that content will load quickly on Twitter Lite. We want to make sure you can see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening no matter what network you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on!\nBookmarks: Running low on data? Want to save a Tweet for later? Bookmarks is an easy-to-use feature that allows you to save important Tweets for later, for when you have more data or a better internet connection.\nPush notifications: Starting today, Twitter Lite supports push notifications, allowing you to keep up with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening around the world.\nNight mode: Night mode gives your timeline a darker theme, which is easier on your eyes and easier to read \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even during the day.\nThreads: Following our announcement last year, threaded Tweets are now available on Twitter Lite! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made it easy to create a thread by adding a plus button in the composer, so you can connect your thoughts and publish your threaded Tweets all at the same time.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAs mobile-first users continue to change how we use the internet, we want to make sure that Twitter is relevant, useful, and dependable.

While we welcome everyone to express themselves on our service, we prohibit targeted behavior that harasses, threatens, or uses fear to silence the voices of others. We have the Twitter Rules in place to help ensure everyone feels safe expressing their beliefs and we strive to enforce them with uniform consistency.\nOur policies and enforcement options evolve continuously to address emerging behaviors online and we sometimes come across instances where someone is reported for an incident that took place prior to that behavior being prohibited. In those instances, we will generally require the individual to delete the Tweet that violates the new rules but we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t generally take other enforcement action against them (e.g. suspension). This is reflective of the fact that the Twitter Rules are a living document. \u00c2\u00a0We continue to expand and update both them and our enforcement options to respond to the changing contours of online conversation. This is how we make Twitter better for everyone.\nWe are continually working to update, refine, and improve both our enforcement and our policies, informed by in-depth research around trends in online behavior both on and off Twitter, feedback from the people who use Twitter, and input from a number of external entities, including members of our Trust & Safety Council. \u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nA few examples of how our rules have changed*:\nIn August 2013, we added a section explicitly prohibiting \u00e2\u0080\u009ctargeted harassment\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the Twitter Rules under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbuse and Spam\u00e2\u0080\u009d category.\nIn December 2015, we added a separate \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbusive Behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d section to the Twitter Rules.\nIn November 2016, we shared more details around hateful conduct and how we enforce policy violations.\nSince then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve updated the list of abusive behaviors we prohibit to include unwanted sexual advances, posting or sharing intimate photos or videos of someone that were produced or distributed without their consent, wishes or hopes of harm, and threats to expose or hack someone.\nLast year we expanded hateful conduct and media policies to include abusive usernames and hateful imagery. We also updated rules around violence and physical harm to include the glorification of violence and violent extremist groups.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nSimilarly, our enforcement options have expanded significantly over the years. We originally had only one enforcement option: account suspension. Since then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added a range of enforcement actions and now have the ability to take action at the Tweet, Direct Message, and account levels. Additionally, we take measures to educate individuals that have violated our rules about the specific tweet(s) in violation and which policy has been violated. We also continue to improve the technology we use to prioritise reports that are most likely to violate our rules and last year we introduced smarter, more aggressive witness reporting to augment our approach.\nGiven the scale of Twitter, we will not always get it right. We believe we have to rely on a straight-forward principled approach and focus on the long term goal of understanding - not just in terms of the service itself - but in terms of the role we play in society and our wider responsibility to foster and better serve a healthy public conversation.\n----\nReference:\nTwitter Help Center \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Our approach to policy development and enforcement philosophy\nTwitter blog \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Serving the Public Conversation During Breaking Events\nJuly 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Twitter Rules\nAugust 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Twitter Rules (addition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTargeted Harassment\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\nApril 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Twitter Rules (addition of \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbusive Behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d section)\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nhealth\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

We want everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience on Twitter to be free of abuse, harassment, and other types of behaviors that can detract or distort from the public conversation. Work has been underway for months to make progress in these areas, such as making changes so you can be confident in your follower counts, introducing new signals into how we present and organize Tweets, sharing more on our expanded efforts to fight malicious automation, and acquiring Smyte to address safety, spam, and security challenges more quickly and effectively.\nIf you want to improve something, you must be able to measure it. Inspired by our friends at Cortico, a nonprofit research organization that has taken the time to more deeply understand the concept of measuring conversational health, we wanted to examine what this would look like for Twitter. However, we knew this was not something we should address alone, and put out a request for proposals to help us develop a measurement framework. Partnering with outside experts who can provide thoughtful analysis, external perspective, and rigorous review is the best way to measure our work and stay accountable to those who use Twitter. Since March, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reviewed more than 230 proposals from around the world that challenged us to think critically about how we can define and measure the health of public conversation on Twitter.\nOur teams reviewed each proposal in depth. To start, we organized a review committee with representatives from diverse groups across Twitter, including Engineering, Product, Machine Learning, Data Science, Trust & Safety, Legal, and Research. In the first round, each proposal was reviewed and scored by two different people. The 50 proposals that made it to the next round were each reviewed by a total of four different people, and then the 16 semifinalists were further evaluated by a small committee of subject-matter experts. Finally, we interviewed a handful of finalists by video conference before making the final selection. By the end, we had written more than 350 reviews in total and examined the finalists in depth; as a result, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident in the process that led us to the two extraordinary partners we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve selected.\nExamining echo chambers and uncivil discourse\nLed by Dr. Rebekah Tromble, assistant professor of political science at Leiden University, along with Dr. Michael Meffert at Leiden, Dr. Patricia Rossini and Dr. Jennifer Stromer-Galley at Syracuse University, Dr. Nava Tintarev at Delft University of Technology, and Dr. Dirk Hovy at Bocconi University, this project will develop two sets of metrics: how communities form around political discussions on Twitter, and the challenges that may arise as those discussions develop.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the context of growing political polarization, the spread of misinformation, and increases in incivility and intolerance, it is clear that if we are going to effectively evaluate and address some of the most difficult challenges arising on social media, academic researchers and tech companies will need to work together much more closely. This initiative presents an important and promising opportunity for Twitter and our team of researchers to share expertise and work on solutions together,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tromble said.\nThe Leiden-led project will primarily focus on two key challenges: echo chambers and uncivil discourse. Based on their past findings, echo chambers, which form when discussions involve only like-minded people and perspectives, can increase hostility and promote resentment toward those not having the same conversation. The project\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first set of metrics will assess the extent to which people acknowledge and engage with diverse viewpoints on Twitter.\nThe second set of metrics will focus on incivility and intolerance in Twitter conversations. The group has found that while incivility, which breaks norms of politeness, can be problematic, it can also serve important functions in political dialog. In contrast, intolerant discourse \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as hate speech, racism, and xenophobia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is inherently threatening to democracy. The team will therefore work on developing algorithms that distinguish between these two behaviors.\nThe project brings together scholars with different backgrounds and expertise, bridging political science, communication, and computer science. The six scholars working together across four universities will combine deep social scientific subject expertise with strong technical expertise to develop and adapt measures of healthy conversations on Twitter.\nBridging gaps between communities on Twitter\nProfessor Miles Hewstone and John Gallacher at\u00c2\u00a0the University of Oxford, in partnership with Dr. Marc Heerdink at the University of Amsterdam, will be studying how people use Twitter, and how exposure to a variety of perspectives and backgrounds can decrease prejudice and discrimination.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very excited about the opportunity to work with Twitter on investigating the important social challenges of a digitally connected world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miles Hewstone, Ph.D., professor of social psychology at Oxford University. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvidence from social psychology has shown how communication between people from different backgrounds is one of the best ways to decrease prejudice and discrimination. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re aiming to investigate how this understanding can be used to measure the health of conversations on Twitter, and whether the effects of positive online interaction carry across to the offline world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe project builds on Professor Hewstone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding work to study intergroup conflict. When the communication between groups contains more positive sentiments, cooperative emotions, and more complex thinking and reasoning from multiple perspectives, prejudice is reduced and relations can improve. This was previously demonstrated in a variety of contexts, including in post-conflict community building efforts in Northern Ireland as well as in online communities. As part of the project, text classifiers for language commonly associated with positive sentiment, cooperative emotionality, and integrative complexity will be adapted to the structure of communication on Twitter.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nEnsuring we have thoughtful, comprehensive metrics to measure the health of public conversation on Twitter is crucial to guiding our work and making progress, and both of our partners will help us continue to think critically and inclusively so we can get this right. We know this is a very ambitious task, and look forward to working with these two teams, challenging ourselves to better support a thriving, healthy public conversation.\nThank you to everyone who submitted an application \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we are grateful to all who took the time and initiative to help shape this critical work. We look forward to working with these two organizations, and the broader academic community to counsel and support our teams to create healthier experiences on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nhealth\nTwitter Media\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

We do not. But let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start with, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is shadow banning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe best definition we found is this: deliberately making someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content undiscoverable to everyone except the person who posted it, unbeknownst to the original poster.\nWe do not shadow ban. You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow (although you may have to do more work to find them, like go directly to their profile). And we certainly don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.\nWe do rank tweets and search results. We do this because Twitter is most useful when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immediately relevant. These ranking models take many signals into consideration to best organize tweets for timely relevance. We must also address bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or detract from healthy conversation.\nAs a specific example, if a search result has 30,000 tweets, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we take into consideration when ranking:\nTweets from people you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in should be ranked highly\nTweets that are popular are likely to be interesting and should be higher ranked\nTweets from bad-faith actors who intend to manipulate or divide the conversation should be ranked lower\nThis last bullet is the basis of our work around serving healthy public conversation. Here are some of the signals we use to determine bad-faith actors:\nSpecific account properties that indicate authenticity (e.g. whether you have a confirmed email address, how recently your account was created, whether you uploaded a profile image, etc)\nWhat actions you take on Twitter (e.g. who you follow, who you retweet, etc)\nHow other accounts interact with you (e.g. who mutes you, who follows you, who retweets you, who blocks you, etc)\nWe know this approach is working because we see fewer abuse reports and spam reports.\nWhat Happened This Week\nYesterday, we identified an issue where some accounts weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t auto-suggested in search even when people were searching for their specific name. To be clear, this only impacted our search auto-suggestions. The accounts, their tweets and surrounding conversation about those accounts were showing up in search results. As of yesterday afternoon, this issue was resolved.\nThere were a number of follow up questions relating to our thread yesterday that we wanted to address:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow many people were impacted by the search auto-suggest issue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hundreds of thousands of accounts were impacted by this issue. This impact was not limited to a certain political affiliation or geography. And, to be clear, these accounts were only impacted within search auto-suggestions-- they still appeared in search results. This issue has now been resolved.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looks like this only affected Republican politicians. Were Democratic politicians also impacted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yes, some Democratic politicians were not properly showing up within search auto-suggestions as result of this issue. As mentioned above, the issue was broad-ranging and not limited to political accounts or specific geographies. And most accounts affected had nothing to do with politics at all.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOK, so there was a search auto-suggest issue. But what caused these Republican representatives to be impacted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d For the most part, we believe the issue had more to do with how other people were interacting with these representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts than the accounts themselves (see bullet #3 above). There are communities that try to boost each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence on the platform through coordinated engagement. We believe these types of actors engaged with the representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts-- the impact of this coordinated behavior, in combination with our implementation of search auto-suggestions, caused the representatives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 accounts to not show up in auto-suggestions. In addition to fixing search yesterday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to improve our system so it can better detect these situations and correct for them.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on making these systems better and smarter over time and sharing our work and progress with all of you. We think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to promoting healthy public conversation on Twitter and earning trust.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nhealth\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Information that is housed on one platform can not be easily and securely transferred to other services. This is not a positive collective experience for the people who use our services and we are keen to work through some of the challenges as an industry. The Data Transfer Project is an open source initiative aiming to empower any company to create tools that enable people to freely move their information across the web - without barriers. To start, our companies want to share experiences and knowledge to carve out a positive path forward.\nAt Twitter, we feel strongly that portability and interoperability are central to innovation on the internet. We believe that a more frictionless, individually-driven forms of data transfer between online platforms and services will result in an innovative, creative, and people-first online experience for all. Making it easier for users to choose among services also facilitates competition, empowering everyone to try new services and choose the offering that best suits their individual needs. This facilitative and collaborative spirit of openness is the principled bedrock of our free and open internet. It is a principle we at Twitter are dedicated to furthering.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nAlongside Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve produced a white paper that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designed to set the course we want to chart as this project evolves. In keeping with our overarching principles around transparency and accountability, this process of information sharing between our companies and the related work streams will be open for all to scrutinise, critique, and to build off. To find out more and to help us along our way, please visit the dedicated GitHub Data Transfer Project site.\nAs always, we will keep you updated on our progress. This will take time but we are very excited to work with innovators and passionate people from other companies to ensure we are putting you first. Fundamentally this about pushing towards a more open and dynamic internet for you to engage with and one that places the control and the power in your hands.\nFollow @Policy for more updates.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nuser experience\npolicy\nprivacy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

Follower counts are a visible feature, and we want everyone to have confidence that the numbers are meaningful and accurate.\nOver the years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve locked accounts when we detected sudden changes in account behavior. In these situations, we reach out to the owners of the accounts and unless they validate the account and reset their passwords, we keep them locked with no ability to log in. This week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be removing these locked accounts from follower counts across profiles globally. As a result, the number of followers displayed on many profiles may go down.\nMost people will see a change of four followers or fewer; others with larger follower counts will experience a more significant drop. We understand this may be hard for some, but we believe accuracy and transparency make Twitter a more trusted service for public conversation.\nThough the most significant changes are happening in the next few days, follower counts may continue to change more regularly as part of our ongoing work to proactively identify and challenge problematic accounts.\nWhy does an account get locked?\nIf we detect sudden changes in account behavior, we may lock the account and contact the owner to confirm they still have control of it. These sudden changes in account behavior could include Tweeting a large volume of unsolicited replies or mentions, Tweeting misleading links, or if a large number of accounts block the account after mentioning them. We sometimes lock an account if we see email and password combinations from other services posted online and believe that information could put the security of an account at risk \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so we require accounts to change of their passwords for protection. Until we confirm that everything is ok with the account, we lock it, which makes them unable to Tweet or see ads.\nHow are these accounts different from spam or bots?\nIn most cases, these accounts were created by real people but we cannot confirm that the original person who opened the account still has control and access to it.\nSpam accounts (sometimes referred to as bots) typically exhibit spammy behavior from the beginning, are increasingly predictable by our systems, and can be automatically shut down with our technology.\u00c2\u00a0You can learn more about our ongoing work to prevent spam on Twitter here.\nWhy just followers? Will this expand to Tweets, Likes, and Retweets?\nOur ongoing work to improve the health of conversations on Twitter encompasses all aspects of our service. This specific update is focused on followers because it is one of the most visible features on our service and often associated with account credibility. Once an account is locked, it cannot Tweet, like or Retweet and it is not served ads.\nWill this change affect your Monthly Active User (MAU) or Daily Active User (DAU) metrics?\nNo, it will not. Removing locked accounts from followers doesn't impact MAU or DAU. Locked accounts that have not reset their password in more than one month are not included in MAU or DAU. While today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s change doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect MAU or DAU, some accounts we remove from the service as part of our ongoing commitment to a healthy public conversation have the potential to impact publicly reported metrics.\nContinuing to Communicate with You\nThis is another step to improve Twitter and ensure everyone can have confidence in their followers.

Please visit Business.Twitter.com to learn more and download a historical archive of all political and issue ads prior to the prohibition of both Political and Issue Ads on Twitter.\nLast year, we announced our intention to provide transparency for all ads running on Twitter, with a specific emphasis on political advertising. Our first step towards this was releasing a new Political Campaigning Ads Policy for US federal elections and candidates.\nToday we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to share the second part of our efforts, the Ads Transparency Center, which allows anyone across the globe to view ads that have been served on Twitter, with even more transparency around US federal election campaigning ads.\nWhat does it look like?\nSimilar to the search experience on Twitter, to view ads from any advertiser you will be able to simply search for a specific handle and see the creative for all ad campaigns that have run within the last 7 days from that handle.\u00c2\u00a0If an ad is reported and taken down from Twitter, it will be tombstoned in the Ads Transparency Center within approximately 24 hours. If the account was suspended, Tweets will not be shown in the ATC. The same applies to deleted users and Tweets. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFor US political advertisers that fall under our new Political Campaigning Policy, you will be able to see further details, including billing information, ad spend, and impression data per Tweet.

This will allow users to easily identify political campaign ads, know who paid for them, and whether it was authorized by a candidate.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWho has access to the Ads Transparency Center?\nEveryone around the world will have access to the Ads Transparency Center. No login or Twitter account will be required, making it very simple for people to have clear insight and details on who is advertising on Twitter. The Ads Transparency Center will include all advertisers on Twitter globally, but only US federal election campaigning ads that fall under our new policy will be shown at this stage.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nWe will be launching a specific issue ads policy in the future, as well as enhancements to the Ads Transparency Center itself. In addition, we are examining how to adapt and internationalize both political campaigning and issue ads policies. We are doing our due diligence to get this right and will have more updates to come.

One of the most important parts of our focus on improving the health of conversations on Twitter is ensuring people have access to credible, relevant, and high-quality information on Twitter. To help move toward this goal, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve introduced new measures to fight abuse and trolls, new policies on hateful conduct and violent extremism, and are bringing in new technology and staff to fight spam and abuse.\nBut we know there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still a lot of work to be done. Inauthentic accounts, spam, and malicious automation disrupt everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience on Twitter, and we will never be done with our efforts to identify and prevent attempts to manipulate conversations on our platform.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share some recent progress and new measures for how we handle spam, malicious automation, and platform manipulation.\nNew processes for fighting malicious automation and spam\nTwitter fights spam and malicious automation strategically and at scale. Our focus is increasingly on proactively identifying problematic accounts and behavior rather than waiting until we receive a report. We focus on developing machine learning tools that identify and take action on networks of spammy or automated accounts automatically. This lets us tackle attempts to manipulate conversations on Twitter at scale, across languages and time zones, without relying on reactive reports. \nOur investments in this space are having a positive impact:\nIn May 2018, our systems identified and challenged more than 9.9 million potentially spammy or automated accounts per week. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up from 6.4 million in December 2017, and 3.2 million in September.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nDue to technology and process improvements during the past year, we are now removing 214% more accounts for violating our spam policies on a year-on-year basis.\nAt the same time, the average number of spam reports we received through our reporting flow continued to drop \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from an average of approximately 25,000 per day in March, to approximately 17,000 per day in May. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also seen a 10% drop in spam reports from search as a result of our recent changes. These decreases in reports received means people are encountering less spam in their timeline, search, and across the Twitter product.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also moving rapidly to curb spam and abuse originating via Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s APIs. In Q1 2018, we suspended more than 142,000 applications in violation of our rules \u00e2\u0080\u0094 collectively responsible for more than 130 million low-quality, spammy Tweets. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve maintained this pace of proactive action, removing an average of more than 49,000 malicious applications per month in April and May. We are increasingly using automated and proactive detection methods to find misuses of our platform before they impact anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience. More than half of the applications we suspended in Q1 were suspended within one week of registration, many within hours.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThese numbers tell us that our tools are working: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re preventing or catching more of this activity ourselves before you ever see it on Twitter.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nPlatform manipulation and spam are challenges we continue to face and which continue to evolve, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re striving to be more transparent with you about our work. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing four new steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to address these issues:\n\u00c2\u00a0\n1) Reducing the visibility of suspicious accounts in Tweet and account metrics\n\u00c2\u00a0\nA common form of spammy and automated behavior is following accounts in coordinated, bulk ways. Often accounts engaged in these activities are successfully caught by our automated detection tools (and removed from our active user metrics) shortly after the behavior begins. But we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done enough in the past to make the impact of our detections and actions clear. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve started updating account metrics in near-real time: for example, the number of followers an account has, or the number of likes or Retweets a Tweet receives, will be correctly updated when we take action on accounts.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nSo, if we put an account into a read-only state (where the account can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage with others or Tweet) because our systems have detected it behaving suspiciously, we now remove it from follower figures and engagement counts until it passes a challenge, like confirming a phone number. We also display a warning on read-only accounts and prevent new accounts from following them to help prevent inadvertent exposure to potentially malicious content. If the account passes the challenge, its footprint will be restored (though it may take a few hours). We are working to make these protections more transparent to anyone who may try to interact with an account in this read-only state.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAs a result of these improvements, some people may notice their own account metrics change more regularly. But we think this is an important shift in how we display Tweet and account information to ensure that malicious actors aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to artificially boost an account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credibility permanently by inflating metrics like the number of followers.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nStay tuned: In the coming weeks, we will have more to share about additional steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to reduce the impact of this sort of activity on Twitter.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n2) Improving our sign-up process\n\u00c2\u00a0\nTo make it harder to register spam accounts, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also going to require new accounts to confirm either an email address or phone number when they sign up to Twitter. This is an important change to defend against people who try to take advantage of our openness. We will be working closely with our Trust and Safety Council and other expert NGOs to ensure this change does not hurt someone in a high-risk environment where anonymity is important. Look for this to roll out later this year.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n3) Auditing existing accounts for signs of automated sign-up\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also conducting an audit to secure a number of legacy systems used to create accounts. Our goal is to ensure that every account created on Twitter has passed some simple, automatic security checks designed to prevent automated signups. The new protections we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve developed as a result of this audit have already helped us prevent more than 50,000 spammy sign-ups per day.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nAs part of this audit, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re imminently taking action to challenge a large number of suspected spam accounts that we caught as part of an investigation into misuse of an old part of the sign-up flow. These accounts are primarily follow spammers, who in many cases appear to have automatically or bulk followed verified or other high-profile accounts suggested to new accounts during our signup flow. As a result of this action, some people may see their follower counts drop; when we challenge an account, follows originating from that account are hidden until the account owner passes that challenge. This does not mean accounts appearing to lose followers did anything wrong; they were the targets of spam that we are now cleaning up. We've recently been taking more steps to clean up spam and automated activity and close the loopholes they'd exploited, and are working to be more transparent about these kinds of actions.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n4) Expansion of our malicious behavior detection systems\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also now automating some processes where we see suspicious account activity, like exceptionally high-volume Tweeting with the same hashtag, or using the same @username without a reply from the account you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re mentioning. These tests vary in intensity, and at a simple level may involve the account owner completing a simple reCAPTCHA process or a password reset request. More complex cases are automatically passed to our team for review.\nWhat you can do\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThere are important steps you can take to protect your security on Twitter:\nEnable two-factor authentication. Instead of only entering a password to log in, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also enter a code which is sent to your mobile phone. This verification helps make sure that you, and only you, can access your account.\nRegularly review any third-party applications. You can review and revoke access for applications by visiting the Apps tab in your account settings on twitter.com.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reuse your passwords across multiple platforms or websites. Have a unique password for each of your accounts.\nYou can also use a FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) security key for login verification when signing into Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAdditionally, if you believe you may have been incorrectly actioned by one of our automated spam detection systems, you can use our appeals process to request a review of your case.\nNext steps\nGoing forward, Twitter is continuing to invest across the board in our approach to these issues, including leveraging machine learning technology and partnerships with third parties. We also look forward to soon announcing the results of our request for proposals for public health metrics research.\nThese issues are felt around the world, from elections to emergency events and high-profile public conversations. As we have stated in recent announcements, the public health of the conversation on Twitter is a critical metric by which we will measure our success in these areas.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nhealth\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

Take a scroll through the numerous social feeds on your phone and you are bound to see branded content from a creator. For marketers today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not \u00e2\u0080\u009cif\u00e2\u0080\u009d you should be partnering with creators but more so \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy and how\u00e2\u0080\u009d to partner with them. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even more important for brands to understand is that there is a unique why and how for every platform - especially for Twitter.\nTo help brands and agencies better understand how to incorporate creator content into their Twitter strategy, we partnered with Magna and IPG Media Lab on a Twitter-sponsored study to analyze what brands and marketers should know about working with creators, how to optimize creator content, and what they have to gain from working with creators.\nTHE WHY\nCreators are today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s celebrities. They are not just influential - they entertain, inform and inspire audiences by sharing original content every single day. On Twitter, they are more than just a part of \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In fact, 2 of 3 Twitter users agree that creators actually change and shape culture*. In many instances, they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMore than any other platform, Twitter is about conversation. Creators turn to Twitter to build a community, and their followers come to the platform to connect directly with the creators they love the most. In fact, 61% of Twitter users follow a creator, more so than on any other platform*.\nWhen individuals who carry a wealth of influence and creativity become more accessible and their thoughts and conversations more transparent, audiences begin to trust those individuals. People look to creators for recommendations over online reviews, brand Tweets, and traditional TV and digital ads when it comes to what to buy, where to go, and what to watch. Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word-of-mouth marketing is often driven by creators on Twitter.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe results of this media trial proved that creator content is a valuable asset for brands. To keep up with the fast-moving pace of social environments, branded creator content is a quick, easy, and affordable way for advertisers to impact consumers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kara Manatt, SVP Intelligence Solutions & Strategy at MAGNA.\nTHE HOW\nCreators are unique in that they care just as much about the content they produce as the brand does - first and foremost, original content is their livelihood. In order to ensure their content feels authentic, 94% of creators look for brands that connect with their style and image*. They want to work with brands that share a common aesthetic, and partner to create content that feels true to their message and their audience.\nCreators also want to be more than just a production resource - collaboration is key to successful creator-driven marketing campaigns. 93% of creators look for brands that want to hear their ideas and tap into their voice*. Creators are experts at eliciting a response from their audience and brands should trust this expertise. Provide guidelines but let the creator come back with ideas that feel genuine to their feed.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWHAT MARKETERS HAVE TO GAIN\nWhen you partner with creators in a way that feels authentic, all parties will benefit. Brand metrics are higher across the board when creators are recognized as genuine. These include:\n+61% increase in brand favorability\n+88% increase in purchase intent\n+64% increase in recommendation intent*.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn fact, branded content from creators drives increased view times for those ads on Twitter. Audiences on Twitter spend 24% more time watching an ad from a creator, because they are more genuine and trustworthy*. This in turn drives significant impact to lower funnel metrics. Twitter users who recall an ad from a creator show a +39% increase in brand favorability, and +41% increase in purchase intent, versus ads recalled that were produced by brands*. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMAKE IT HAPPEN\nFinally, once you understand \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009chow\u00e2\u0080\u009d to work with creators - you also need to determine the best way to connect with them. From a creator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standpoint, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d much rather work with experts in the space who can effectively translate the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs while supporting creators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 creative integrity.\nFor brands on Twitter, Niche is your solution. Niche is Twitter's talented team of Strategists and Content Managers who connect brands on Twitter with the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best creators to reach an audience through premium, original content. Niche has one of the largest and most diverse community of creators in the world and understands fully how to optimize branded creator content across any category.\nIn addition to custom content needs, Twitter also just launched Creator Originals, a new program that enables creators to produce their own high-end content series. Brands can partner now with creators on programs, in line with our in-stream video sponsorship offerings.\nCreators are what's happening on Twitter - and with Niche, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier than ever to partner with them for powerful branded content.\nMETHODOLOGY\nWe conducted a research study with Magna and IPG Media Lab in a two-phased approach, using a creator perspective and consumer perspective. In Phase 1, the creator perspective, we partnered with Niche to survey creators in the US and UK and understand the creator experience of making content and the process in working with brands (n=171). In Phase 2, the consumer perspective, we surveyed participants in the US from a representative online panel via a mobile survey (n=3,251). We first asked demographic and media consumption behavior questions and then participants were asked to view their Twitter feed to determine their ad experience. We tested promoted content and leveraged a post experience survey to measure traditional brand metrics. This was done across 12 brands and 9 industry verticals.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n*Twitter + Magna IPG Media Lab, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Art of the Creator\u00e2\u0080\u0099, 2018 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ninfluencers\nNiche\nresearch\nmarketing\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

The court ordered the DOJ to review the gag order every three years, making clear that any non-disclosure obligation must be narrowly tailored to a finite time period for review.\nIn addition to sharing this ruling, we can now publish and provide user notice to the affected account-holders for seven more NSLs (10-271500, 10-276879, 10-287342, 10-291339, 10-293548, 10-302279, 10-315095) \u00c2\u00a0where the gag orders have been lifted in response to our petitions, as well as publish and provide user notice to the affected account-holders for two additional NSLs (15-419074, 10-320727) where the DOJ has lifted any non-disclosure requirement. \u00c2\u00a0This brings the total number of NSLs that we have been able to publish since 2010 to 15. \u00c2\u00a0We will update the numbers in our US Report when we publish our next Transparency Report later this year.\nLastly, while we are pleased to share these details with you today, there is no mechanism by which we could ask that gag orders for any requests received under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\u00e2\u0080\u009cFISA\u00e2\u0080\u009d) be reviewed or lifted. \u00c2\u00a0Nor are we able to publish the numbers of such requests, to the extent we had received them, except in bands. Our ongoing litigation in pursuit of greater transparency in this regard, Twitter v. Sessions, is continuing. \u00c2\u00a0We remain steadfast, in Sessions, in asserting that the restrictions on our ability to share information related to FISA requests (to the extent we had received them) with our users and the public are unconstitutional.\n We will continue to take practical steps to promote meaningful transparency, and look forward to sharing more updates about these efforts as they become available. \u00c2\u00a0As always, you can learn more about our commitment to protecting free expression in our Help Center. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntechnology\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

We heard from you that Explore would be easier navigate if it was organized by topic instead of content type (video, articles, etc). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now experimenting with topic tabs in Explore so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in news and entertainment, and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most relevant to you.

More than one thousand Moments are created every week, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now available in 16 markets and five languages. These collections of Tweets are a great way to understand and catch up with a story and the discussion around it.\nNew Look\nRight now, you swipe horizontally to read Moments, but our research showed us that Moments are easier to use vertically, just like your timeline. In our tests of this new look, we saw significantly more people using and returning to Moments. So, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re starting to introduce this new vertical timeline experience for Moments.\nSome Moments \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including Moments outside of the US, Sponsored Moments and Moments created by you \u00e2\u0080\u0094 will temporarily continue to be horizontal as we roll out this change.\nMore Tweets\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out multiple timelines in some US Moments to help you see all the best Tweets surrounding a story: a recap timeline showing Tweets you may have missed, another showing the latest, as well as top commentary when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a live video, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see it there, too.

As we stated last year, we are committed to enforcing stricter policies for political advertisers and providing clear, transparent disclosure for all ads on Twitter, with more details for political campaigning ads.\nToday, we are launching our Political Campaigning Policy in the United States to provide clear insight into how we define political content and who is advertising political content on Twitter. \nWhat will this policy entail?\nAs part of this new policy, we will require advertisers who want to run political campaigning ads for Federal elections to self-identify and certify that they are located in the US Candidates and committees will have to provide their FEC ID, and non-FEC registered organizations and individuals will have to submit a notarized form. We will send a letter to the mailing address registered with the FEC, business, or individual to validate the identity and location of all political campaigning advertisers. In addition, we will not allow foreign nationals to target political ads to people who are identified as being \u00c2\u00a0in the US.\nAdditionally, handles used for political campaigning advertising will have to comply with stricter requirements. The handle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profile photo, header photo, and website must be consistent with its online presence and the Twitter bio must include a website that provides valid contact information.\nWe will also be including a visual badge and disclaimer information on promoted content from certified accounts in the near future. This will allow users to easily identify political campaigning ads, know who paid for them, and whether it was authorized by a candidate.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Sample iOS Experience \u00a0\n          \n          \n        \n          \n            Sample iOS Experience \u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nThis complements our recent announcement around US election labels, which will appear on the campaign Twitter accounts of candidates running for state Governor, or for the US Senate or US House of Representatives, during the 2018 US midterm general election. These labels contain relevant information about a political candidate, including the office the candidate is running for, the state the office is located in, district number (when applicable), and will be clearly identifiable with a small icon of a government building.\nWhen will enforcement begin?\nEnforcement of this policy will begin later this summer, after which only certified advertisers will be allowed to run political campaigning ads. Political advertisers can apply now for certification.\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nAs stated earlier this year, we will be launching an Ads Transparency Center this summer. The Ads Transparency Center will provide insight into all ads running on Twitter, with even more details on political campaigning ads, including ad spend and targeting demographics.\nIssue ads will fall under a separate upcoming policy. This allows us to have a nuanced approach to transparency that is mindful of the inherent difference between political and issue-oriented advertising campaigns. Given the global nature of our company, we are also looking into how these policies can be enforced internationally and will have more to share in the future.\nThis is just the beginning of our efforts in increased transparency for all advertising on Twitter.

This is especially true during elections, where Twitter has become the first place voters go to seek accurate information, resources, and breaking news from journalists, political candidates, and elected officials.\nWe understand the significance of this responsibility and our teams are building new ways for people who use Twitter to identify original sources and authentic information.\nWith that goal in mind, today we are introducing US election labels for specified candidates running in the 2018 US midterm general election.\nWhat are US election labels?\nLabels contain relevant information about a political candidate, including the office the candidate is running for, the state the office is located in, district number (when applicable), and will be clearly identifiable with a small icon of a government building. The label will appear on the Twitter Profile page of the candidate and alongside all Tweets sent or Retweeted by the account everywhere Tweets are visible \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Tweets embedded off of Twitter.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhich candidates will qualify for US election labels?\nLabels appear on the campaign Twitter accounts of candidates running for state Governor, or for the US Senate or US House of Representatives, during the 2018 US midterm general election.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter is partnering with Ballotpedia, a non-profit, civic organization that publishes nonpartisan information on federal, state, and local politics, to help identify the campaign Twitter accounts of candidates once they qualify for the general election ballot for an applicable office.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWhen will US election labels appear?\n\u00c2\u00a0\nLabels will begin to appear after May 30 on the campaign Twitter accounts of candidates who have already qualified for the general election ballot for an applicable office.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis will continue on a rolling basis as states continue to hold primary elections and candidates officially qualify for the general election ballot.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWhat are the next steps?\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe are launching this tool initially for specified offices during the 2018 US midterm general election.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nProviding the public with authentic, trustworthy information is crucial to the democratic process, and we are committed to furthering that goal through the tools we continue to build.\nUpdate: When election labels first launched, applicable candidates were required to opt-in to the program in order to receive a label.

One important issue we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to address is what some might refer to as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrolls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Some troll-like behavior is fun, good, and humorous. What we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter, particularly in communal areas like conversations and search. Some of these accounts and Tweets violate our policies, and, in those cases, we take action on them. Others don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t but are behaving in ways that distort the conversation.\nTo put this in context, fewer than 1% of accounts make up the majority of accounts reported for abuse, but a lot of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reported does not violate our rules. While still a small overall number, these accounts have a disproportionately large \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and negative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 impact on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience on Twitter. The challenge for us has been: how can we proactively address these disruptive behaviors that do not violate our policies but negatively impact the health of the conversation?\nA new approach\nToday, we use policies, human review processes, and machine learning to help us determine how Tweets are organized and presented in communal places like conversations and search. Now, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tackling issues of behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation in those areas by integrating new behavioral signals into how Tweets are presented. By using new tools to address this conduct from a behavioral perspective, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to improve the health of the conversation, and everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience on Twitter, without waiting for people who use Twitter to report potential issues to us.\nThere are many new signals we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking in, most of which are not visible externally. Just a few examples include if an account has not confirmed their email address, if the same person signs up for multiple accounts simultaneously, accounts that repeatedly Tweet and mention accounts that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow them, or behavior that might indicate a coordinated attack. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also looking at how accounts are connected to those that violate our rules and how they interact with each other.\nThese signals will now be considered in how we organize and present content in communal areas like conversation and search. Because this content doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t violate our policies, it will remain on Twitter, and will be available if you click on \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow more replies\u00e2\u0080\u009d or choose to see everything in your search setting. The result is that people contributing to the healthy conversation will be more visible in conversations and search.\nResults\nIn our early testing in markets around the world, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen this new approach have a positive impact, resulting in a 4% drop in abuse reports from search and 8% fewer abuse reports from conversations. That means fewer people are seeing Tweets that disrupt their experience on Twitter.\nOur work is far from done. This is only one part of our work to improve the health of the conversation and to make everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Twitter experience better. This technology and our team will learn over time and will make mistakes. There will be false positives and things that we miss; our goal is to learn fast and make our processes and tools smarter.

This day serves as an annual reminder about the importance of freedom of the press in elevating public discourse, illuminating issues of civic importance, holding public officials accountable, and strengthening democracy across the world. World Press Freedom Day carries special significance in the wake of the killing of ten journalists in Afghanistan on April 30 -the bloodiest day for reporters since the war began. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter was created 12 years ago to be a platform where anyone -- no matter where they are in the world -- can answer the question, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening right now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Today journalists, NGOs, and defenders of the free press play a vital part in answering that question on Twitter.

We recently identified a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone.\nOut of an abundance of caution, we ask that you consider changing your password on all services where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used this password. You can change your Twitter password anytime by going to the password\u00c2\u00a0settings\u00c2\u00a0page.\nAbout The Bug\nWe mask passwords through a process called hashing using a function known as bcrypt, which replaces the actual password with a random set of numbers and letters that are stored in Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s system. This allows our systems to validate your account credentials without revealing your password. This is an industry standard.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nDue to a bug, passwords were written to an internal log before completing the hashing process. We found this error ourselves, removed the passwords, and are implementing plans to prevent this bug from happening again.\nTips on Account Security\nAgain, although we have no reason to believe password information ever left Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s systems or was misused by anyone, there are a few steps you can take to help us keep your account safe:\nChange your password on Twitter and on any other service where you may have used the same password.\nUse a strong password that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reuse on other websites.\nEnable login verification, also known as two factor authentication. This is the single best action you can take to increase your account security.\nUse a password manager to make sure you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using strong, unique passwords everywhere.\nWe are very sorry this happened.

We want to continue providing our Microsoft users with the latest and greatest, and will be adding additional features like night mode, in the coming weeks and months.\nWe encourage everyone to update the Windows app as soon as you update your OS as previous versions will no longer be available for download starting today and no longer supported starting June 1st. \u00c2\u00a0If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running Windows 8.1 or below, you can access the latest update by updating to Windows 10 or through twitter.com in your browser to continue enjoying the full Twitter experience. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nproduct\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          \nMeasure your launch and connect campaigns using Twitter Brand Surveys\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 3 December 2019\n          \nIntroducing Topics\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 11 November 2019\n          "}

We work hard to build a great experience for people Tweeting, and seeing Tweets all over the world, and protecting the privacy of the people who use Twitter every day. We believe you should know the types of data you share with us and how we use it. Most importantly, you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower you to make the best decisions about the information that you share with us and to ensure you feel confident that your data is protected and secure. As Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Data Protection Officer, I will be working to continue our longstanding commitment to protecting you and upholding your right to privacy.\nHistory of Our Privacy Policies\nFrom the beginning, Twitter has been a global platform for people to make themselves heard and to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. We are proud of our history of partnering with civil society and standing up to governments to protect and defend the people that use our services, and we continue to evolve our efforts around documenting our work.\nWe also recognize that to enjoy real freedom of expression, you also need and deserve meaningful privacy and security controls. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this very philosophy that has informed the process of updating and revising our Privacy Policy for everyone who uses Twitter around the world. \u00c2\u00a0We used this same philosophy in preparing our approach to the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into effect next month.\nUpcoming Changes\nStarting this month, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be introducing some changes to make it easier to manage your personal information on Twitter. As a first step, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve updated our Privacy Policy to make it visually clear and easy to use. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also see a download button at the top of the page that allows you to get a plain text version if you prefer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s optimized for both mobile and web.\nWe want our Privacy Policy to be easy to understand and follow. What you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see as you navigate through the policy is that we have broken it into seven main sections. This makes up the core of our approach.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPlain language.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve expanded and revised content throughout the updated Privacy Policy to make sure that some of the more legalistic or technical language is as clear as possible. For example, we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absolutely essential that you know exactly what we mean when we refer to location data or data from advertising partners.\nPrivacy settings.\nWoven throughout are direct links to your core privacy and security settings, which are accessible at any time when you are logged into Twitter. Here you can see what data Twitter has relating to your account and you can decide whether you want to share it or not. Over time, as we learn how people use these controls, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to work to improve them and Twitter as a whole. \u00c2\u00a0\nA conversation.\nWe welcome your comments and questions about our data practices. Within the Privacy Policy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find an efficient way to contact Twitter directly about any privacy concerns you may have. When you contact Twitter, only the Data Protection Officer (me) and my team have access to your questions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also keep you posted on our latest updates from @Policy.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that the new Privacy Policy will take effect on May 25th and will apply globally. By using our services on or after that date, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be agreeing to these updates and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall Terms of Service.\nNext Steps\nOn May 25th, people who live in the EU who log into their Twitter account will see a prompt that will explain that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve updated our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy to reflect the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s General Data Protection Regulation. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also show you a simple chart that categorizes the legal basis for the personal data we process. Specifically, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be encouraged to review our updated policies in full.

Whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time rescue efforts of Hurricane Harvey survivors in Texas, capacity-building with Indian NGOs who aid flooded communities, verifying credible voices after major events, or sending prompts to French citizens in the wake of the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, our goal is to provide support to people in times of crisis, and show people what matters most.\nOver the past few months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve refined our tools, improved the speed of our response, and identified areas where we can improve. In light of the horrific attack at YouTube headquarters this week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sharing more detail on how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re tackling an especially difficult and volatile challenge: our response to people who are deliberately manipulating the conversation on Twitter in the immediate aftermath of tragedies like this. In the 24 hours since this incident was first reported on Twitter there were more than 1.3 million Tweets about it, reflecting just how quickly these conversations unfold and the sheer volume of information that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared.\nWhat Happened\nWhen information from the shooting at YouTube HQ started to appear on Twitter, we saw credible and relevant information from individuals and news organizations. We also saw accounts deliberately sharing deceptive, malicious information, sometimes organizing on other networks to do so.\nThere are various policies we rely on in these types of situations, but we do not have a policy under which Twitter validates content authenticity or accuracy. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve previously shared, we strongly believe Twitter should not be the arbiter of truth. However, we do see information shared on the service in a way that violates many of our existing policies, as happened in the immediate aftermath of the attack in San Bruno. During these types of situations, some of the ways we evaluate content include:\nIs the content posted to harass or abuse another person, violating our rules on abusive behavior?\nIs this meant to incite fear against a protected category as outlined in our hateful conduct policy?\nCould misrepresenting someone in this way cause real-world harm to the person who is targeted per our rules on violent threats?\nIs this account attempting to manipulate or disrupt the conversation and violating our rules against spam?\nCan we detect if this account owner has been previously suspended? As outlined in our range of enforcement options, when someone is suspended from Twitter, the former account owner is not allowed to create new accounts.\nUsing these policies and enforcement options as our rationale for evaluating the conversation surrounding the YouTube shooting, we immediately started requiring account owners to remove Tweets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many within minutes of their initial creation \u00e2\u0080\u0094 for violating our policies on abusive behavior. We also suspended hundreds of accounts for harassing others or purposely manipulating conversations about the event. Immediately following a crisis, we rapidly implement proactive, automated systems to prevent people who had been previously suspended from creating additional accounts to spam or harass others, and to help surface potentially violating Tweets and accounts to our team for review.\nWhile we were removing Tweets and accounts that broke our rules, our team was also focused on identifying and surfacing relevant and credible content people could trust. Moments highlighting reliable information were available in 16 countries and in five different languages \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many within 10 minutes of the first Tweets \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and also surfaced within top trends related to the situation. Throughout the incident and the following day, we continued to surface updates as they became available.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhere We Go From Here\nThis work is ongoing. We are continuing to explore and invest in what more we can do with our technology, enforcement options, and policies \u00e2\u0080\u0093 not just in the U.S., but to everyone we serve around the world. Initial ideas include better use of our technology to catch people working to evade a suspension and identifying malicious, automated accounts, and more quickly activating our team to ensure a human review element continues to be present within our all of automated processes.\nWe're committed to continuing to improve and to holding ourselves accountable as we work to make Twitter better for everyone. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking forward to sharing more soon.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ncrisis response\nhealth\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}
{"date": "Thursday, 5 April 2018", "title": "Expanding and building #TwitterTransparency", "topic": "Company", "author": "", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2018/twitter-transparency-report-12", "post_text": "Company\nExpanding and building #TwitterTransparency\nThursday, 5 April 2018\nLink copied successfully\nWith our 12th biannual Twitter Transparency Report, we continue to expand and build upon our commitment to providing meaningful transparency about requests we receive to disclose account information or remove content. In particular, we are announcing updates on our work to permanently suspend terrorist accounts from Twitter, more granular data on our country-withheld content policy, and expanded reporting on requests for account information.\nOver 1.2 Million Accounts Suspended for Terrorist Content Since August 2015 \nDuring the reporting period of July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, a total of 274,460 accounts were permanently suspended for violations related to the promotion of terrorism. This is down 8.4% from the volume shared in the previous reporting period and is the second consecutive reporting period in which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a drop in the number of accounts being suspended for this reason. We continue to see the positive, significant impact of years of hard work making our site an undesirable place for those seeking to promote terrorism, resulting in this type of activity increasingly shifting away from Twitter.\nBetween August 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017, we suspended 1,210,357 accounts from Twitter for violations related to the promotion of terrorism.\u00c2\u00a0 Of those 274,460 accounts suspended in the last reporting period, 93% were flagged by internal, proprietary tools, and 74% of those accounts were suspended before their first Tweet. Government reports of violations related to the promotion of terrorism represent less than 0.2% of all suspensions in the most recent reporting period and reflect a 50% reduction in accounts reported compared to the previous reporting period.\nIncreasing Country Withheld Content Transparency\nIn December 2017, we updated our in-product messaging about withheld content to more precisely explain the reason for withholding. Subsequently, we began to differentiate between legal demands (e.g., court orders) and reports based on local law(s) (e.g., reports alleging the illegality of content in a particular country). These changes are now reflected in this latest Transparency Report, which includes details about removal requests from trusted reporters and non-governmental organizations that we reviewed for potential violations of local law(s). More details are available in the expanded Removal Requests report.\nExpanding US County-Level Transparency Reporting\nIn our last Transparency Report, we introduced a breakdown of non-federal information requests from California at the county level. We are now expanding this section to include counties from the other top non-federal requesters: Florida, Maryland, New York, and Virginia.\nLegal Threats to Freedom of Expression\nWith the passage of new legislation and ongoing regulatory discussions taking place around the world about the future of public discourse online, we are seeing a potential chilling effect with regards to freedom of expression. According to Human Rights Watch, the wave of regulatory pressure in Europe and beyond is setting an emerging precedent and creating a \u00e2\u0080\u009cdomino effect\u00e2\u0080\u009d as \u00e2\u0080\u009cgovernments around the world increasingly look to restrict online speech by forcing social media companies to act as their censors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAs regulators explore further potential restrictions, transparency is one of the most important ways we can continue to protect freedom of expression. Twitter is proud of our industry-leading policies regarding transparency about content restrictions. This includes our practice of uploading actioned requests to withhold content to Lumen, an independent database that collects and analyzes removal requests for content online (unless we are prohibited from doing so, e.g., if we receive a court order under seal). Lumen serves as a critical transparency resource as more freedom of expression comes under fire, by making such requests available for public review. \u00c2\u00a0Additionally, upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we promptly notify affected users (unless, like with our Lumen uploads, we are otherwise prohibited from doing so).\nPublic Health and Transparency\nOur commitment to transparency around how we enforce our Terms of Service and the Twitter Rules is part of our effort to increase the collective health, openness, and civility of public conversation around the world, and to hold ourselves publicly accountable toward progress. As we explore how we can best measure the health of the public conversation, we will look for ways to provide transparency around any new public health metrics. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

Today we're introducing an easy way to Tweet that brief moment of what matters from longer, live videos.\nSometimes, we want to draw attention to the specific moment in a live video that made us think, surprised us, or made us laugh. Previously, we could only Tweet an entire live video, which made it difficult to discuss what matters most. We saw people Tweeting with the specific time in the video directing us to the part they wanted us to watch.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSo, we built Timestamps which lets anyone Tweet a live or replay video starting from the exact moment they want to discuss.\nSharing Timestamps is easy. When you tap to share a live video, you can easily slide back to the exact time you want your audience to watch. From there, add your thoughts, and Tweet it to the world.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nAnyone seeing your Tweet will start watching at the time within the video you shared. If the broadcast is still live, they can easily skip to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening by tapping \u00e2\u0080\u009clive\u00e2\u0080\u009d at any time. The feature is available for any live video, whether from a professional content publisher or someone broadcasting from their phone.\nPeople have always used Twitter to talk about the things they experience. With Timestamps, now we can show rather than just tell everyone what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.

We know our best work comes from having a diverse workforce and we are constantly seeking new perspectives to make our company stronger.\nA New Approach\nWhen I joined Twitter in 2017, my first priority was to listen and learn. I spent time with leaders and employees around the world, assessing our strategy around inclusion and diversity and aligning with the newly formed people leadership team. Across the board I saw passion, authenticity, and a deep commitment. A solid foundation was in place \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but the world is changing fast, and we still have more to do.\nGiven the unique role Twitter plays in the world, we decided to approach the concept of diversity differently. Our goal is to create a more inclusive culture and diverse workforce by developing a strategy that begins with building a foundation of respect and understanding. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re focused on powering positive change by fostering respectful conversations, creating deeper human connections, and encouraging diverse interactions across the company. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling this strategy Intersectionality, Culture and Diversity (ICD) and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making it a part of everything we do at Twitter.\nA New Campaign\nAs part of this broader ICD strategy we introduced #GrowTogether, a campaign that encourages our people around the world to make personal commitments toward fostering an inclusive workplace. From day-to-day work practices and policies, to people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engagement with leadership and with each other, we aim to create and sustain a commitment to inclusion in everything we do.\nTo kick off, we began a listening tour across our offices globally, mindful that the experience of inclusion is not the same around the world, or even across all of our U.S. offices. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re activating programming for our people to foster intersectionality and respect for similarities and differences, enabling and encouraging everyone to bring every part of themselves to work. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also learning about what makes each office unique and special, as well as what Twitter can do better to make their experiences more inclusive. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nInside, Out\nIn addition to implementing #GrowTogether, we furthered our commitment to a more inclusive world by fostering important conversations on our service, creating programs that build a culture of inclusion, and partnering with organizations that are focused on building more diverse workplaces across the broader tech industry.\nWe harnessed the power of our platform to develop global campaigns celebrating diversity, including #HereWeAre, #SheInspiresMe, #HispanicHeritageMonth, #PrideIsHappening and #ForTheCulture. These hashtags serve as a helpful tool to build community around important issues, creating momentum that leads to movements.\nWe continued partnering with organizations such as Girls Who Code and Code2040 and hosted the 2017 Women Who Code Connect Conference. We also attended some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest gatherings of diverse tech talent including ADCOLOR, AfroTech, National Center for Women & Information Technology, and Tech Inclusion, with the goal of fostering professional development within Twitter and meeting and recruiting diverse talent.\nWith our University Recruiting team, we followed diverse talent to strengthen our pipeline and had active presences at Grace Hopper, National Society of Black Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Engineers, always looking for more ways to find the next generation of diverse tech leaders.\nWe created and implemented new programs: #EarlyBird focused on first-year students interested in computer science who identify as Black, Hispanic/Latinx and/or Native American, #TechProud brought together second year students interested in computer sciences who identify as LGBTQIA+, and #DevelopHER invited second year female students interested in computer science to Twitter.\u00c2\u00a0\nOur Business Resource Groups (BRGs, formerly Employee Resource Groups) are instrumental to fostering diverse communities at Twitter and providing programming to help us celebrate the cultures and identities of our people. Both on the platform and off, @TwitterAlas, @TwitterAsians @Blackbirds, @TwitterOpen, @TwitterParents, @TwitterStripes, and @TwitterWomen create spaces where individuals and allies can come together. Our partnership with the BRGs, in 2017, more closely aligned their 2018 efforts with our business goals.\nIn 2017, \u00c2\u00a0the @TwitterWomen #SheInspiresMe highlighted the power of women on our service.\nFor the second year, @TwitterOpen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work help us achieve 100% compliance with Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.\nFor more on how our BRGs spent 2017, check out these Moments: @TwitterAlas, @TwitterAsians,\u00c2\u00a0@Blackbirds, @TwitterOpen, @TwitterParents, @TwitterStripes, and @TwitterWomen\nOur 2017 Results\nWith our commitment to creating an even more inclusive and diverse community at Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen progress in hiring and career development and encouraged company-wide commitments to a more inclusive culture.\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur Goals\nWe know we have more work to do, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making some changes to our goals and how we report them moving forward. As part of our new approach to ICD, we took a critical look at our workforce and reframed our goals to put specific focus on increasing overall women, Black, and Latinx representation, areas which continue to be underrepresented in tech. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve set our goals for a two year period, which allows us to better assess our progress, develop specific programming, and adapt our strategies along the way. We will continue to publicly report our progress regularly as we work to achieve these goals over the next two years.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhile these goals allow us to focus on three key areas, they are just part of our overall ICD strategy. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re implementing strategies to source diverse talent, putting forth programs that create shared ownership across all functions, and integrating an intersectional mindset into our business culture. We want to help people learn from others different from themselves, have respectful conversations, and make more diverse connections with people around the world.\nICD is becoming an integral part of what we do at every level of the company \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0to see what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up to, follow us @TwitterTogether.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nUPDATE:\u00c2\u00a0We released our diversity report this morning which included a graph that caused some confusion. We want to apologize and clarify.\nConsistent with prior years, we disclosed percentages of a category we labeled as Underrepresented Minorities (URM), which included all non-white and non-asian employees.\nURM also included employees who declined to self-identify, which was not clear in the report and appeared to conflict with the race/ethnicity breakdown we reported. Based on feedback, we realized this was confusing and\u00e2\u0080\u008b we \u00e2\u0080\u008bremoved URM percentages from our report. \u00e2\u0080\u008b\nThe race/ethnicity breakdown in the report is more accurate and granular than URM which we had already decided to move away from. Our new goals put specific focus on increasing overall women, Black, and Latinx representation\u00e2\u0080\u008b at Twitter, and we're holding ourselves accountable.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nEEO-1 Report\nOur EEO-1 report is prepared annually to conform to US government requirements. Those requirements categorize job functions in ways that differ from how Twitter and other companies look at their workforces, and direct the use of visual identification with respect to employees who have not self identified. Our diversity report provides the best insights into our workforce and many of our key efforts to advance our commitment to inclusion and diversity. \nClick here to see our 2017 EEO-1 report.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@TwitterTogether\n#GrowTogether\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndiversity\nTwitter culture\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nInclusion & Diversity Report May 2020: Principles during a pandemic\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 27 May 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

By measuring our contribution to the overall health of the public conversation, we believe we can more holistically approach and measure our impact on the world for years to come.\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health will be built and measured by how we help encourage more healthy debate, conversations, and critical thinking; conversely, abuse, spam and manipulation will detract from it. We are looking to partner with outside experts to help us identify how we measure the health of Twitter, keep us accountable to share our progress with the world and establish a way forward for the long-term.\nThis approach is inspired by work from others in the industry. Cortico, a non-profit research organization, has spent time to more deeply understand the concept of measuring conversational health and developed four indicators to measure it: shared attention, shared reality, variety of opinion, and receptivity. We believe that we can identify indicators of conversational health that are even more specific to Twitter and its impact.\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all of the answers and cannot do this alone, but know that the outcome will be stronger when we look to experts around the world for counsel and support. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in helping us define what health means for Twitter and how we should approach measuring it, please submit your proposal through the form below by Friday, April 13.\nTo Apply\nApplicants should submit a proposal through the online form available below by Friday, April 13, that includes:\nContact information (name, email, organizational details)\nYour proposed health metrics, and methods for capturing, measuring, evaluating and reporting on such metrics\nAnticipated resource requirements and methodology\nProposed output from your proposal and estimated time needed to capture, measure and evaluate health metrics\nRelevant, peer-reviewed, publications and papers\nPlease make clear in your proposal if this is a joint application with another institution.\nAward\nSuccessful applicants will collaborate directly with Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s team, receive public data access and meaningful funding for their research. Funding will be provided as an unrestricted gift to the proposer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s organization(s), to be provided in full at the start of the project.\nOur expectation is that successful projects will produce peer-reviewed, publicly available, open-access research articles and open source software whenever possible.\nTimeline\nSubmissions are due Friday, April 13, and selected applicants will be invited to share further details on their proposals during May and June. We expect to announce the first selected projects in July.\nTerms of Agreement\nThis proposal request in no way constitutes an agreement between Twitter and any applicant. \u00c2\u00a0The issuance of this proposal request does not imply that Twitter is making an offer to do business. Twitter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel this solicitation and proposal request at any time during the process. \u00c2\u00a0This proposal request is not and shall not be considered an \u00e2\u0080\u009cagreement to negotiate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Twitter reserves the right to make any award, group of awards, or no award as it determines in its sole discretion. Twitter may, in its discretion, amend, supplement, terminate, modify, negotiate or otherwise change any provision or part of this proposal request, including but not limited to the evaluation criteria, the process used for evaluation, and/or the expected timeline, at any time prior. Any award of this contract will be made to applicant(s) at the sole discretion of Twitter after consideration of the factors stated above.\u00c2\u00a0 Twitter shall provide only public Twitter data (which shall be used solely for the purposes stated above) and such use shall be subject to additional terms and conditions (including, but not limited to, terms similar to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Developer Terms).

You can save a Tweet with a live morning show like Buzzfeed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s #AM2DM to watch at another time, bookmark a thread from @Lin_Manuel about new Hamilton music to come back to, and save Tweets with links to interesting articles for later reading or sharing. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll no doubt show us more creative uses for Bookmarks than we ever imagined! (You have a tendency to do that on Twitter.)\nBetter Because of Your Feedback\nWe Tweeted ongoing updates as we built Bookmarks so we could incorporate your input as we worked. By working this way, we learned that you like to save replies so you can answer later and that you may share a Tweet hours or days later after you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve bookmarked it. Thank you for being part of this process \u00e2\u0080\u0094 your feedback was valuable in building this update, and it made it all the more fun for us as we built a new feature for you.

We believe that a healthy ecosystem for publishers is paramount to helping people see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world, and we will continue to help publishers succeed. Because of our revenue-share model, success on both ends comes from true partnership. After nearly 5 years investing in Amplify and new digital creator models, we are proud of how our efforts have grown, now extending to over ten markets across the globe. Many publishers are seeing record revenue, with a 60 percent year over year increase in 2017 payout to publishers through our suite of monetization products: In-Stream Video Ads and Sponsorships, Periscope Super Hearts and Niche.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThe Amplify Publisher Program was created to make it easy for publishers to monetize video on Twitter, and also turn-key for advertisers to align with brand-safe content. By working closely with the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s premiere TV networks, sports leagues and teams, digital publishers, advertisers and agencies, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gained an understanding of our partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 needs.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nToday, we are sharing an update to our eligibility requirements for new and existing publishers as part of the Amplify Publisher Program. These requirements, which apply to In-Stream Video Ads and Sponsorships, will strengthen our partnership with those who adhere to Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Safe for Ads guidelines, newly updated today. We believe this will provide more clarity on what is acceptable to be monetized.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPremium publishers must meet the following criteria:\nBe verified\nPublish brand-safe content according to\u00c2\u00a0Safe For Ads\u00c2\u00a0content guidelines\nBe an active Twitter video publisher\nAccept the Amplify Publisher Program Terms & Conditions\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThese eligibility requirements ensure that brands can reach their target audience while aligning with premium publisher content.

More than ever, we will be focused on developing new products and features that truly help advertisers leverage the unique strengths of Twitter - helping brands be what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nGetting back to basics: connecting the consumer with the advertiser.\nTo ensure a clearer focus as a team, we needed to strip ourselves from thinking product-first, and go deep in understanding our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (and clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099) emotional and functional needs.\nWe did this by first understanding at the core, why do people come to Twitter? We know that they come to see and talk about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes Twitter special. By developing stronger synergies and really understanding where consumers are spending their time and how they are spending their time, we will be able to build the best advertising solutions that truly leverage what makes Twitter unique and different.\nUnderstanding how to scale our platform.\nFrom finding the intersection between the consumer and advertiser, we then took a step back to understand what our role is specifically for brands. We found that brands come to Twitter for three main reasons:\nTo launch something new to the marketplace, such as a product or new campaign.\nTo connect with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, and what people are talking about.\nTo promote their brand story, and ongoing branding campaigns.\nEach of these pillars help grow a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business by achieving specific goals, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raising awareness around a new product, engaging with existing and new customers, or simply having a cohesive brand voice. By honing in on these three categories, and understanding how the consumer falls under each, we can focus on that sweet spot that sits between the consumer and the advertiser.\nOver the course of 2017, we launched key product enhancements that have helped us better fulfill these advertiser needs, such as:\nPromoting your brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story with more effective formats. With the recently introduced Video Website Card, we have made it easy for people to learn more about a brand by allowing them to tap right into deeper content directly through a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video. And since the video continues to play while the site is loading, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen significant increases in time spent on the site.\nConnecting with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening via live event sponsorships. To further connect with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, Twitter offers a unique opportunity for brands to sponsor events, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the lead-up, during, or after. This is a great way to connect in real-time with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, and brands such as HP are finding success with this innovative type of sponsorship.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nAs we look ahead to 2018, we want to continue to drive the consumer-advertiser intersection and make it easier than ever for brands to reach their objectives. We will do so by focusing on the following:\nInvesting in innovative formats that empower brands to express themselves. We will continue to create advertising solutions that are unique while still embracing formats that we know work.\nImproving advertiser's ability to target audiences through increased machine learning and new planning tools. We will enable advertisers to reach new audiences by launching new targeting products built on our unique Twitter data. We will also improve planning and forecasting tools to help advertisers accurately predict what their campaigns will achieve before they launch.\nMaking it easier to advertise on Twitter by developing a more seamless way to buy. We are going to continue to make it easier to buy on Twitter to ensure a seamless experience from the very beginning. We are also testing new ways to buy ads, including third-party demand, and are currently learning from these tests.\nWe are going back to basics, while using our machine learning capabilities to help connect our advertisers to the best and most relevant content and customers. We are excited for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come, and will be providing regular updates along the way.

Twitter shows the world what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. We all contribute, we all have our part to play.\nSafety is an integral part of everything we do as a company. We recognize that to express yourself on our platform, you must feel safe. Over the past 12 months, we've introduced a range of new policies and tools to improve Twitter for everyone, including refinements to the core of our product. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also launched a brand new Safety Center and met and engaged with our Trust & Safety Council for the first ever Twitter Trust & Safety Summit, with the goal of soliciting their direct, expert feedback on our vision for a safer Twitter.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing results. By leveraging our technology, improving our core functionality, and introducing a host of brand new features, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a marked improvement. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also providing better user education and demonstrating increased transparency around our decision-making and the philosophy behind the Twitter Rules.\nTo celebrate the global conversation around internet safety, we launched a special emoji that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activated by using the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2018. The emoji helped to unify and strengthen the conversation around Safer Internet Day, encouraging users to create, connect, and share respect online. So far, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been more than 100,000 Tweets using the dedicated hashtags, generating 6,516,275 impressions.  \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nColin Crowell, VP, Global Public Policy & Corporate Philanthropy, Twitter, commented:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSafer Internet Day salutes the unparalleled potential and opportunity of the internet. This potential, if harnessed creatively, safely, and securely, can further the public good and elevate civic conversation worldwide. To get there, we must work together as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our shared responsibility. For our part, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken big strides forward over the last year across our policies, product, and educational outreach to improve the Twitter experience for everyone. For now, we thank our partners across the globe for their ongoing support and counsel. They make us better and we value their insights and expertise greatly. Create, connect, and share respect using the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2018.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSarah Willoughby, Insafe Team at European Schoolnet (EUN), commented: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter has always been strong supporters of Safer Internet Day and, as coordinators of the Insafe network of helplines and awareness centres, we very much value the relationship that we have with them. Raising awareness of the benefits but also the challenges of the internet and online communications is crucial, and the SID emoji helps to highlight our messages and encourage public discussion, dialogue and debate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn Europe, @TwitterDublin and @TwitterUK worked with the Insafe Team to coordinate the launch and promotion of the global #SaferInternetDay emoji, while also supporting the promotion of content through @safeinternetday and @UK_SIC. Across the continent, we supported partners such as @Webwise in Ireland and @klicksafe in Germany through our Ads for Good program, ensuring that their voice and core message was elevated on Safer Internet Day and beyond.\nIn Singapore, @TwitterSG hosted the Singapore Media Literacy Council\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch of its 2018 #BetterInternetSG campaign. Together with key social outreach organisations and the Digital Quotient Institute, @TwitterSG will partner with the Media Literacy Council throughout 2018, conducting digital literacy workshops for parents. With our support, a parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resource for the online space will also be created in all four official languages of Singapore. This targeted resource will include Twitter safety tips and best practices.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nIn Indonesia, we invited\u00c2\u00a0@DamarJuniarto\u00c2\u00a0from the South East Asia Freedom of Expression Network (@SAFEnetvoice) to write a guest\u00c2\u00a0blog\u00c2\u00a0and to share some tips to stay safe on the internet. We then amplified this across Indonesia using\u00c2\u00a0@TwitterID. There is also ongoing discussion of collaboration with SAFEnet for a possible joint campaign during Safer Internet Month later this year. \nIn India, we worked with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (@GoI_MEITY) and hosted a Twitter Q&A on cyber security questions, using #SaferInternetDay. The Director General of @IndianCERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) answered a range of questions and provided safety tips on avoiding phishing attacks and reporting cyber crime. We also worked with law enforcement agencies like @Uppolice, @MumbaiPolice, and @BlrCityPolice, as well as NGO partners @CSR_India, @INBreakthrough, and @YouthKiAwaaz to use the emoji to drive civic conversation.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn KSA, @TwitterMENA worked in cooperation with \u00c2\u00a0@CITC_SA, the Saudi Communication and Information Technology Commission.

Japan, Google, Airbnb, LINE and Mercari, participated.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nIn Australia, we worked with our safety partners to promote helpful tips and best practices about how to stay safe on Twitter. For example, using an Ads for Good grant, @Reachout_AUS was able to let kids know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone online and to learn Reachout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top five tips for how to deal with cyberbullying. @TwitterAU also put together a dedicated Twitter Moment that was updated over the course #SID2018. We sought to create just a snapshot of the vital work our safety partners are doing to support people across Australia and New Zealand. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn Spanish Speaking LatAm, @TwitterLatam collaborated in different ways to promote the outreach efforts of leading NGOs in the field. In Mexico and Chile, for example, we provided Ads For Good grants for @Redlamyc, @vocacioncentral, and @derechosdigital, as well as the Educator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Guide to Twitter to boost their efforts to promote a safer and secure Twitter. While in Colombia, we held a safety training for key in-market NGOs, all with with the help of our partner @karisma.\nIn Brazil, we attended @Safernet event hub in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo in which they discussed freedom of expression, online safety and education, and how to promote counternarratives online. We also awarded our partner in Brazil an Ads for Good grant to boost their efforts to promote a healthier, more secure environment online, and amplified Safernet's content through @TwitterBrasil.\nCheck out our continuing updates to promote a safer Twitter at @TwitterSafety.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTags:\npolicy\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

More than ever, we will be focused on developing new products and features that truly help advertisers leverage the unique strengths of Twitter - helping brands be what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nGetting back to basics: connecting the consumer with the advertiser.\nTo ensure a clearer focus as a team, we needed to strip ourselves from thinking product-first, and go deep in understanding our customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (and clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099) emotional and functional needs.\nWe did this by first understanding at the core, why do people come to Twitter? We know that they come to see and talk about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening - that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what makes Twitter special. By developing stronger synergies and really understanding where consumers are spending their time and how they are spending their time, we will be able to build the best advertising solutions that truly leverage what makes Twitter unique and different.\nUnderstanding how to scale our platform.\nFrom finding the intersection between the consumer and advertiser, we then took a step back to understand what our role is specifically for brands. We found that brands come to Twitter for three main reasons:\nTo launch something new to the marketplace, such as a product or new campaign.\nTo connect with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, and what people are talking about.\nTo promote their brand story, and ongoing branding campaigns.\nEach of these pillars help grow a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business by achieving specific goals, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raising awareness around a new product, engaging with existing and new customers, or simply having a cohesive brand voice. By honing in on these three categories, and understanding how the consumer falls under each, we can focus on that sweet spot that sits between the consumer and the advertiser.\nOver the course of 2017, we launched key product enhancements that have helped us better fulfill these advertiser needs, such as:\nPromoting your brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story with more effective formats. With the recently introduced Video Website Card, we have made it easy for people to learn more about a brand by allowing them to tap right into deeper content directly through a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video. And since the video continues to play while the site is loading, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen significant increases in time spent on the site.\nConnecting with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening via live event sponsorships. To further connect with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, Twitter offers a unique opportunity for brands to sponsor events, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the lead-up, during, or after. This is a great way to connect in real-time with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, and brands such as HP are finding success with this innovative type of sponsorship.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next?\nAs we look ahead to 2018, we want to continue to drive the consumer-advertiser intersection and make it easier than ever for brands to reach their objectives. We will do so by focusing on the following:\nInvesting in innovative formats that empower brands to express themselves. We will continue to create advertising solutions that are unique while still embracing formats that we know work.\nImproving advertiser's ability to target audiences through increased machine learning and new planning tools. We will enable advertisers to reach new audiences by launching new targeting products built on our unique Twitter data. We will also improve planning and forecasting tools to help advertisers accurately predict what their campaigns will achieve before they launch.\nMaking it easier to advertise on Twitter by developing a more seamless way to buy. We are going to continue to make it easier to buy on Twitter to ensure a seamless experience from the very beginning. We are also testing new ways to buy ads, including third-party demand, and are currently learning from these tests.\nWe are going back to basics, while using our machine learning capabilities to help connect our advertisers to the best and most relevant content and customers. We are excited for what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come, and will be providing regular updates along the way.

Twitter shows the world what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. We all contribute, we all have our part to play.\nSafety is an integral part of everything we do as a company. We recognize that to express yourself on our platform, you must feel safe. Over the past 12 months, we've introduced a range of new policies and tools to improve Twitter for everyone, including refinements to the core of our product. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also launched a brand new Safety Center and met and engaged with our Trust & Safety Council for the first ever Twitter Trust & Safety Summit, with the goal of soliciting their direct, expert feedback on our vision for a safer Twitter.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing results. By leveraging our technology, improving our core functionality, and introducing a host of brand new features, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a marked improvement. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also providing better user education and demonstrating increased transparency around our decision-making and the philosophy behind the Twitter Rules.\nTo celebrate the global conversation around internet safety, we launched a special emoji that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s activated by using the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2018. The emoji helped to unify and strengthen the conversation around Safer Internet Day, encouraging users to create, connect, and share respect online. So far, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been more than 100,000 Tweets using the dedicated hashtags, generating 6,516,275 impressions.  \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nColin Crowell, VP, Global Public Policy & Corporate Philanthropy, Twitter, commented:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSafer Internet Day salutes the unparalleled potential and opportunity of the internet. This potential, if harnessed creatively, safely, and securely, can further the public good and elevate civic conversation worldwide. To get there, we must work together as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our shared responsibility. For our part, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken big strides forward over the last year across our policies, product, and educational outreach to improve the Twitter experience for everyone. For now, we thank our partners across the globe for their ongoing support and counsel. They make us better and we value their insights and expertise greatly. Create, connect, and share respect using the hashtags #SaferInternetDay and #SID2018.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nSarah Willoughby, Insafe Team at European Schoolnet (EUN), commented: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter has always been strong supporters of Safer Internet Day and, as coordinators of the Insafe network of helplines and awareness centres, we very much value the relationship that we have with them. Raising awareness of the benefits but also the challenges of the internet and online communications is crucial, and the SID emoji helps to highlight our messages and encourage public discussion, dialogue and debate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nIn Europe, @TwitterDublin and @TwitterUK worked with the Insafe Team to coordinate the launch and promotion of the global #SaferInternetDay emoji, while also supporting the promotion of content through @safeinternetday and @UK_SIC. Across the continent, we supported partners such as @Webwise in Ireland and @klicksafe in Germany through our Ads for Good program, ensuring that their voice and core message was elevated on Safer Internet Day and beyond.\nIn Singapore, @TwitterSG hosted the Singapore Media Literacy Council\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch of its 2018 #BetterInternetSG campaign. Together with key social outreach organisations and the Digital Quotient Institute, @TwitterSG will partner with the Media Literacy Council throughout 2018, conducting digital literacy workshops for parents. With our support, a parents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resource for the online space will also be created in all four official languages of Singapore.

We then amplified this across Indonesia using\u00c2\u00a0@TwitterID. There is also ongoing discussion of collaboration with SAFEnet for a possible joint campaign during Safer Internet Month later this year. \nIn India, we worked with Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (@GoI_MEITY) and hosted a Twitter Q&A on cyber security questions, using #SaferInternetDay. The Director General of @IndianCERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) answered a range of questions and provided safety tips on avoiding phishing attacks and reporting cyber crime. We also worked with law enforcement agencies like @Uppolice, @MumbaiPolice, and @BlrCityPolice, as well as NGO partners @CSR_India, @INBreakthrough, and @YouthKiAwaaz to use the emoji to drive civic conversation.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn KSA, @TwitterMENA worked in cooperation with \u00c2\u00a0@CITC_SA, the Saudi Communication and Information Technology Commission.

Japan, Google, Airbnb, LINE and Mercari, participated.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nIn Australia, we worked with our safety partners to promote helpful tips and best practices about how to stay safe on Twitter. For example, using an Ads for Good grant, @Reachout_AUS was able to let kids know they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not alone online and to learn Reachout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top five tips for how to deal with cyberbullying. @TwitterAU also put together a dedicated Twitter Moment that was updated over the course #SID2018.

While in Colombia, we held a safety training for key in-market NGOs, all with with the help of our partner @karisma.\nIn Brazil, we attended @Safernet event hub in S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo in which they discussed freedom of expression, online safety and education, and how to promote counternarratives online. We also awarded our partner in Brazil an Ads for Good grant to boost their efforts to promote a healthier, more secure environment online, and amplified Safernet's content through @TwitterBrasil.\nCheck out our continuing updates to promote a safer Twitter at @TwitterSafety.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTags:\npolicy\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

The Retweet, '@reply', and hashtag are examples of this. A few years ago we noticed people creatively stitching Tweets together to share more information or tell a longer story \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like this. We saw this approach (which we call \u00e2\u0080\u009cthreading\u00e2\u0080\u009d) as an innovative way to present a train of thought, made up of connected but individual elements.\nNow, hundreds of thousands of threads are Tweeted every day! But this method of Tweeting, while effective and popular, can be tricky for some to create and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s often tough to read or discover all the Tweets in a thread. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thrilled to share that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making it simpler to thread Tweets together, and to find threads, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier to express yourself on Twitter and stay informed.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made it easy to create a thread by adding a plus button in the composer, so you can connect your thoughts and publish your threaded Tweets all at the same time. You can continue adding more Tweets to your published thread at any time with the new \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdd another Tweet\u00e2\u0080\u009d button. Additionally, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now simpler to spot a thread \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve added an obvious \u00e2\u0080\u009cShow this thread\u00e2\u0080\u009d label.\nA few weeks ago, we expanded our character count to make it easier for people to fit what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking into a Tweet. But we know people also may want to serialize a longer story or thought, or provide ongoing commentary on an event or topic. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where this update to threads comes in! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been using threads in creative ways like these for years \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0the ways and reasons to thread your Tweets are limited only by your imagination.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out these updates to everyone on iOS, Android, and Twitter.com in the coming weeks.

Over the past year, we have formalized this partnership with the launch of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). We hosted our first meeting in August where representatives from the tech industry, government and non-governmental organizations came together to focus on three key areas: technological approaches, knowledge sharing, and research. Since then, we have participated in a Heads of State meeting at the UN General Assembly in September and the G7 Interior Ministers meeting in October, and we look forward to hosting a GIFCT event and attending the EU Internet Forum in Brussels on the 6th of December.  The GIFCT is committed to working on technological solutions to help thwart terrorists' use of our services, and has built on the groundwork laid by the EU Internet Forum, particularly through a shared industry hash database, where companies can create \u00e2\u0080\u009cdigital fingerprints\u00e2\u0080\u009d for terrorist content and share it with participating companies.   The database, which we announced our commitment to building last December and became operational last spring, now contains more than 40,000 hashes. It allows member companies to use those hashes to identify and remove matching content \u00e2\u0080\u0094 videos and images \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that violate our respective policies or, in some cases, block terrorist content before it is even posted.   We are pleased that Ask.fm, Cloudinary, Instagram, Justpaste.it, LinkedIn, Oath, and Snap have also recently joined this hash-sharing consortium, and we will continue our work to add additional companies throughout 2018.  In order to disrupt the distribution of terrorist content across the internet, companies have invested in collaborating and sharing expertise with one another. GIFCT's knowledge-sharing work has grown quickly in large measure because companies recognize that in countering terrorism online we face many of the same challenges.   Although our companies have been sharing best practices around counterterrorism for several years, in recent months GIFCT has provided a more formal structure to accelerate and strengthen this work. In collaboration with the Tech Against Terror initiative \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which recently launched a Knowledge Sharing Platform with the support of GIFCT and the UN Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we have held workshops for smaller tech companies in order to share best practices on how to disrupt the spread of violent extremist content online.   Our initial goal for 2017 was to work with 50 smaller tech companies to to share best practices on how to disrupt the spread of violent extremist material. We have exceeded that goal, engaging with 68 companies over the past several months through workshops in San Francisco, New York, and Jakarta, plus another workshop next week in Brussels on the sidelines of the EU Internet Forum.   We recognize that our work is far from done, but we are confident that we are heading in the right direction. We will continue to provide updates as we forge new partnerships and develop new technology in the face of this global challenge. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\n#SaferInternetDay 2020: Creating a better internet for all\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 February 2020\n          \nHow the @Chiefs #SuperBowl victory played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 3 February 2020\n          \n#KpopTwitter rises to the top with 6.1 billion global Tweets in 2019\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 17 January 2020\n          \n#WorldCupDraw conversation is happening on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 30 November 2017\n          "}

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical to enabling free expression, fostering innovation, enhancing public safety, and maintaining U.S. global leadership on Internet issues. This summer, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced its plan to roll back Net Neutrality protections and solicited feedback from the American people about its proposal. The public opposition has been overwhelming, and Twitter joined millions of people in urging the FCC to rethink its plan.\nIf approved, Chairman Pai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal will gut Net Neutrality, removing the FCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current rules preventing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocking content, slowing down Internet speeds, and engaging in \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaid prioritization\u00e2\u0080\u009d -- the development of discriminatory fast & slow lanes on the Internet with gratuitous new fees.\nIn today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Internet economy, a rollback of Net Neutrality means businesses and startups that operate online or use platforms like Twitter to reach customers would be at the mercy of ISPs for vital communication exchanges.\nFor the millions of people who use Twitter to share their thoughts, start movements, speak truth to power, or find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world, the lack of strong Net Neutrality rules means ISPs have the final word when it comes to the openness of the Internet.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen robust public engagement - from diverse perspectives - around this issue on Twitter, including:\n3.5 million Tweets in the past month on #NetNeutrality\n2.5 million Tweets about #NetNeutrality since Chairman Pai unveiled the details of his proposal last Tuesday\nHalf a million Tweets on the #NetNeutrality Day of Action in July 2017\nAccording to multiple polls, Americans across the political spectrum support Net Neutrality. As a federal agency, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the FCC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job to represent the public interest and consumers, the overwhelming majority of whom want strong Net Neutrality rules.\nEarlier this week, FCC Chairman Pai attempted to distract people away from the serious defects of his proposal by taking swipes at Twitter that were misleading. Given the serious deficiencies of the Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan, his tactics to distract people from it are understandable. \u00c2\u00a0The truth is we are impartial and believe strongly in impartiality. The Twitter platform doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take sides. \u00c2\u00a0Diverse perspectives are present every day and treated equally so users can see every side. \u00c2\u00a0And the Twitter Rules apply to everyone equally. \u00c2\u00a0We note that the Chairman uses Twitter and liberally quoted Tweets in his recent speech. \u00c2\u00a0His voice and perspective are important and his presence on Twitter is most welcome. \u00c2\u00a0We hope he will revert to substantive discussions regarding the impact of his plan.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nAs a global platform, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen what happens when governments take steps to artificially constrain consumer choice and throttle innovation online. Today, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s undeniable that the majority of Americans want strong Net Neutrality rules and understand the serious negative impact the Chairman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposal will have for an open Internet. \u00c2\u00a0Twitter will continue to fight for an open Internet for all. \u00c2\u00a0 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npolicy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\nWhat to expect from Twitter ahead of the first #DemDebate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 26 June 2019\n          \nTwitter reveals first ever Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s World Cup #GoldenTweet award winners\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 16 July 2019\n          \nInsights into the 2019 #FIFAWWC conversation on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 8 July 2019\n          \nHow #E32019 played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 18 June 2019\n          "}

Through on-the-ground user research and Play Store reviews, we received a lot of valuable feedback. People using the app valued its small size, quick loading, and minimal data usage. Based on these positive results, we have decided to bring it to more people around the world. \nStarting today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adding Twitter Lite to the Google Play Store in 24 more countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Latin America, specifically: Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Malaysia, Nigeria, Nepal, Panama, Peru, Serbia, El Salvador, South Africa, Thailand, Tunisia, Tanzania, and Venezuela. \nWhether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using Twitter Lite on the mobile web or through the Google Play Store, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast, takes up less space, and is data-friendly:\nLoads quickly on 2G and 3G networks, and offers offline support in case you temporarily lose your connection\nMinimizes data usage, and offers a data saver mode to download only the images or videos you want to see\nReduces install size to under 3MB so it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take much room on your phone\n\u00c2\u00a0\nNo matter where you are in the world, we want to make Twitter the best way for you to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world and talk about it.

On October 13, 2017, 21 groups presented their plan to compete for 5 seed grants. Our very own Ala\u00e2\u0080\u0099a Agha Karss was part of a winning team with their plan to increase university enrollment for orphans in Jordan. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn your action plan, you have to work for your home country, touch the pain of it, and try to find the cure.

The week puts a spotlight on the importance of digital and media literacy as a key component in the education of children and young people.  Working with schools, libraries, and educational associations and organizations, Media Literacy Week participants seek to inspire a leap in Canadian and US citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thinking towards media education as an important \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and innovative \u00e2\u0080\u0093 approach towards creating thoughtful, engaged and informed young people.  This initiative provides online citizens with a focal point for media-related activities and, at the same time, showcases the creative ways that digital and media literacy are being integrated into classrooms and communities across the world.\nTo celebrate this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Media Literacy Week, Twitter joined a number of initiatives with our partners @MediaSmarts and @MediaLiteracyEd for the third consecutive year. Last year, we held a Digital Citizenship Summit that brought together educators from around the world.  \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe started the week unveiling a dedicated Twitter Emoji with the hashtags #MediaLitWk, #MLW17 and #getsmartonline:\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn the US we collaborated with the National Association for Media Literacy Education to host the closing Media Literacy Week event to celebrate the positive ways that US youth are using social media and to share best practices recommendations between educators and civil society experts. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn Canada, Twitter partnered with @MediaSmarts at their annual opening event at Lisgar Collegiate Institute in Ottawa, where over 100 high school students participated in a number of hands-on workshops including one on Twitter and online empowerment. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBeyond our contribution to this week, at Twitter we have the immense privilege of working with safety organizations who are experts on Media Literacy like Common Sense Media, Connectsafely, or Childnet. With their input, we have been able to develop a guide for educators. As people turn to Twitter to find and share ideas about teaching and learning, we wanted to create a resource geared to help educators make the most of Twitter in the classroom by connecting them to lessons, ideas, and experiences that can support their vital work. We unveiled the resource at NAMLE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual conference in Chicago earlier this year and it is available for download in English and French.\nIn EMEA, @TwitterDublin hosted UNICEF Ireland and 50 high school students for a special all-day event focused on digital literacy and active citizenship. Students were taught how to verify information sources, safeguard their online reputation and break down digital divides. Guest speakers talked about their learning experience with online platforms and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to develop the knowledge required to effectively leverage Twitter to advocate on issues they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re passionate about.  \n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTo ensure the students came away with practical guidance, we gave the group some worksheets featuring web pages and stories that appeared on real sites.

Our ultimate goal is for any user \u00e2\u0080\u0093within Twitter or anywhere online\u00e2\u0080\u0093 to have control over their online experience within the ever-changing digital landscape.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you are interested in learning more about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s media literacy efforts, check our Neighbor Nest where we provide digital literacy workshops to address the needs of low-income users who lack crucial computer skills. While the digital literacy classes cover basic computer and Internet search skills we recognize this is a critical first step to understand how we consume information. No matter the level of digital literacy, we recognize that everyone can benefit from guidelines about constructive online behavior and also provide a digital citizenship workshop to address these needs. In this workshop, Neighbor Nest staff and Twitter volunteers cover topics such as online abuse, media literacy, account security, and reputation management.\nYou can see the best content and tweets in this Moment: Celebrating Media Literacy Week.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\nTwitter reveals first ever Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s World Cup #GoldenTweet award winners\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 16 July 2019\n          \nInsights into the 2019 #FIFAWWC conversation on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 8 July 2019\n          \nWhat to expect from Twitter ahead of the first #DemDebate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 26 June 2019\n          \nHow #E32019 played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 18 June 2019\n          "}
{"date": "Tuesday, 7 November 2017", "title": "Tweeting Made Easier", "topic": "Product", "author": "Aliza Rosen", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2017/tweetingmadeeasier", "post_text": "Product\nTweeting Made Easier\n            By\n            \n  \n  \nTuesday, 7 November 2017\nLink copied successfully\nIn September, we launched a test that expanded the 140 character limit so every person around the world could express themselves easily in a Tweet. Our goal was to make this possible while ensuring we keep the speed and brevity that makes Twitter, Twitter. Looking at all the data, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to share we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve achieved this goal and are rolling the change out to all languages where cramming was an issue.*\nDuring the first few days of the test many people Tweeted the full 280 limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behavior normalized (more on this below). We saw when people needed to use more than 140 characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly, people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter remained.\nHighlights are below and in our additional blogs about our experimentation process, extensive data analysis, research, and design work.\nEasier to Tweet\nHistorically, 9% of Tweets in English hit the character limit. This reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a Tweet, often resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning Tweets before sending. With the expanded character count, this problem was massively reduced \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0that number dropped to only 1% of Tweets running up against the limit. Since we saw Tweets hit the character limit less often, we believe people spent less time editing their Tweets in the composer. This shows that more space makes it easier for people to fit thoughts in a Tweet, so they could say what they want to say, and send Tweets faster than before. You can see this happening in the graph below.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nKeeping Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brevity\nWe \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0and many of you \u00e2\u0080\u0093 were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen. Only 5% of Tweets sent were longer than 140 characters and only 2% were over 190 characters. As a result, your timeline reading experience should not substantially change, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still see about the same amount of Tweets in your timeline. For reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth emphasizing again that people in the test got very excited about the extra space in the beginning and\u00c2\u00a0many Tweets went way beyond 140. People did silly (creative!) things like writing just a few characters per line to make their Tweets extra large. It was a temporary effect and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t last long. We expect to see some of this novelty effect spike again with this week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s launch and expect it to resume to normal behavior soon after.\nEngagement\nIn addition to more Tweeting, people who had more room to Tweet received more engagement (Likes, Retweets, @mentions), got more followers, and spent more time on Twitter. People in the experiment told us that a higher character limit made them feel more satisfied with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, their ability to find good content, and Twitter overall.\nWe are making this change after listening and observing a problem our global community was having (it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t easy enough to Tweet!), studying data to understand how we could improve, trying it out, and listening to your feedback. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue listening and working to make Twitter easier for everyone while making sure we keep what you love.\n*Japanese, Korean, and Chinese will continue to have 140 characters because cramming is not an issue in these languages. In fact, these languages have always been able to say more with their Tweets because of the density of their writing systems. We shared more about this thinking and our research here.\n**On this graph, there is a small bump in the red line (which represents the group with 280 characters) at 140 because these people were also using older Twitter clients which didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the ability to send longer Tweets, so they continued to hit the 140 character limit.

In the weeks ahead, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll launch separate pages for each of our policies to provide even more context about what each policy covers and our rationale for enforcement.\nSome of the biggest updates include the following:\nAbusive behavior\nWe are making it clear that context \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including if the behavior is targeted, if a report has been filed and by whom, and if the Tweet itself is newsworthy and in the legitimate public interest \u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 is crucial when evaluating abusive behavior and determining appropriate enforcement actions. Expect more detail on how we review and enforce all of our policies and the range of enforcement options in a separate update on November 14.\nSelf-harm\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always shared resources with people experiencing suicidal or self-harming thoughts when we learn of such behavior, and removed any Tweets that encourage or promote suicide games. Our updated policy on suicide and self-harm clarifies how strictly we enforce this policy, and how we communicate with anyone promoting or encouraging this type of behavior.\nSpam and related behaviors\nWe are more clearly defining spam, how it behaves on Twitter, and sharing the factors we consider when reviewing accounts that may be spam. As part of this update, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also clarifying that when we review accounts that demonstrate spam-like behavior, we focus on behavioral signals, not the factual accuracy of the information they share.\nGraphic violence and adult content\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re providing more specific detail around the types of content we consider to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cgraphic violence\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cadult content.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also updating our media policy Help Center page so it includes examples that help set expectations around the types of content covered by this policy. Please note that the media policy will be updated again on November 22, to account for hateful imagery.\nWe have worked on this clarified version of our rules for the past few months to ensure it takes into account the latest trends in online behavior, considers different cultural and social contexts, and properly sets expectations around what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed on Twitter. We incorporated feedback from our global Trust and Safety Council, who provided important guidance about how to best present our policies to the world. On November 22, we will share another version of our rules, which will include new policies around violent groups, hateful imagery, and abusive usernames. We are constantly evaluating our rules and iterating to make them clearer. As always, we appreciate your feedback, and we are looking forward to continuing working to make Twitter safer, together.  \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsafety\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          "}

This decision was based on the retrospective work we've been doing around the 2016 US election\u00c2\u00a0and the US intelligence community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conclusion that both RT and Sputnik attempted to interfere with the election on behalf of the Russian government. We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter. \nEarly this year, the US intelligence community named RT and Sputnik as implementing state-sponsored Russian efforts to interfere with and disrupt the 2016 Presidential election, which is not something we want on Twitter. This decision is restricted to these two entities based our internal investigation of their behavior as well as their inclusion in the January 2017 DNI report. This decision does not apply to any other advertisers. RT and Sputnik may remain organic users on our platform, in accordance with the Twitter Rules.\nTwitter has also decided to take the $1.9 million we are projected to have earned from RT global advertising since they became an advertiser in 2011, which includes the $274,100 in 2016 US-based advertising that we highlighted in our September 28 blog post, and donate those funds to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections, including use of malicious automation and misinformation, with an initial focus on elections and automation.

We will also be improving controls for our customers and adopting stricter advertising policies.\u00c2\u00a0\nAll Ads: Advertising Transparency Center\nIn the coming weeks, we will launch an industry-leading transparency center that will offer everyone visibility into who is advertising on Twitter, details behind those ads, and tools to share your feedback with us.\nSpecifically, the Transparency Center will show:\nAll ads that are currently running on Twitter, including Promoted-Only ads\nHow long ads have been running\nAd creative associated with those campaigns\nAds targeted to you, as well as personalized information on which ads you are eligible to receive based on targeting\nPeople can also report inappropriate ads or give negative feedback (i.e. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this ad\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for every ad running on Twitter, whether the ad targets you or not. This feedback will help us more quickly remove inappropriate ads from Twitter, and show you more relevant ads in your timeline.\nPolitical (Electioneering) Ads\nElectioneering ads are those that refer to a clearly identified candidate (or party associated with that candidate) for any elected office.* To make it clear when you are seeing or engaging with an electioneering ad, we will now require that electioneering advertisers identify their campaigns as such. We will also change the look and feel of these ads and include a visual political ad indicator.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n             An example of what a future political ad may look like\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn the Transparency Center, there will be a special section for electioneering ads that will include:\nAll ads that are currently running or that have run on Twitter, including Promoted-Only ads\nDisclosure on total campaign ad spend by advertiser\nTransparency about the identity of the organization funding the campaign\nTargeting demographics, such as age, gender and geography\nHistorical data about all electioneering ad spending by advertiser\nWe are also updating our policies for electioneering advertisers to:\nInclude stricter requirements on who can serve these ads and limit targeting options\nRequire electioneering advertisers to self-identify as such\nIntroduce stronger penalties for advertisers who violate policies\nRegarding Issue-Based Ads\nWe are committed to stricter policies and transparency around issue-based ads. There is currently no clear industry definition for issue-based ads but we will work with our peer companies, other industry leaders, policy makers, and ad partners to clearly define them quickly and integrate them into the new approach mentioned above.\nThe Way Forward\nWe will make these updates first in the US, and then roll them out globally. We will share our progress here with all of you along the way.\nLast week, Senators Mark Warner (D-VA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John McCain (R-AZ) and Representatives Derek Kilmer (D-WA), and Mike Coffman (R-CO) introduced the\u00c2\u00a0Honest Ads Act legislation. We thank these members and others for their foresight in drawing attention to these issues as well as Chairman Hurd (R-TX) for holding a public hearing today on political advertising laws and regulations to facilitate a thoughtful discussion on disclosure policy. We look forward to engaging with Members of Congress and other key stakeholders on these issues as the legislative process continues.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n*\u00e2\u0080\u009cElectioneering Advertisements\u00e2\u0080\u009d Definition\nTwitter is basing our definition of \u00e2\u0080\u009celectioneering\u00e2\u0080\u009d ads on the FEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing definition: this means ads that refer to a clearly identified candidate (or party associated with that candidate) for any elected office, are targeted to the relevant electorate for that federal candidate and are publicly distributed within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election. This policy will also apply to ads on our platform that run at any time and expressly advocate for a clearly identified political candidate.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\nATC\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nFleets: a new way to join the conversation\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 November 2020\n          \nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nTransparency around image cropping and changes to come \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 1 October 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          "}

We write one set of rules for the hundreds of millions of people who use Twitter and the hundreds of millions of Tweets sent every day. Given that scale, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built a process that gives us time to recognize the impact of what these changes mean for everyone.\nMaking a policy change requires in-depth research around trends in online behavior, developing language that sets expectations around what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowed, and reviewer guidelines that can be enforced across millions of Tweets. Once drafted, we gather feedback from our teams and Trust & Safety Council. We gather input from around the world so that we can consider diverse, global perspectives around the changing nature of online speech, including how our rules are applied and interpreted in different cultural and social contexts. We then test the proposed rule with samples of potentially abusive Tweets to measure the policy effectiveness and once we determine it meets our expectations, build and operationalize product changes to support the update. Finally, we train our global review teams, update the Twitter Rules, and start enforcing it.\nWe hope this helps explain our process and why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to be thoughtful and deliberate about changes to our safety policies.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\nsafety\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          "}

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve focused on this mission for several years \u00e2\u0080\u0094 helping best-in-class brands drive impactful experiences at scale. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to announce that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve expanded the team to support even more brands with a new arm offering end-to-end creative consulting and support, #Fuel.  Brands want to move at the speed of culture, and this team is designed to address that need. #Fuel is an agile, rapid-response hub that responds quickly to creative briefs. The team develops content strategy to help set the strategic foundation, builds creative ideas to drive participation with brands, and drives video editing to help assets work harder in the feed. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve worked on more than 100 campaigns over the past few months with early brand partners.  Content strategy Twitter is the first place people go to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being talked about. They come leaned in with a discovery mindset, and that offers marketers a critical moment of receptivity. According to research from IPG, video ads in a curated social feed like Twitter are perceived to be more relevant and less intrusive than similarly skippable units on other platforms. Video ads on Twitter are also found to be almost 2X as memorable when compared to the same ads on other premium sites.  The #Fuel team helps brands develop their content strategy to connect with consumers and drive business impact. In Twitter Planning Studios, strategists work with brand partners to map moments of receptivity, develop content pillars, and apply creative best practices that earn attention in the fast-moving feed.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nCreative ideas While consumers skip uninteresting ads, they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skip experiences. Twitter is unique in that brands can create experiences that enable participation and drive conversation. The #Fuel team helps brands realize their creative potential through Twitter products like conversational video, chatbots, and auto-response campaigns that deliver custom content.\nAdditionally, the #Fuel team is helping brand partners develop their live-stream strategy. We worked with Converse to strengthen how they connect with their consumers, Generation Z. Leveraging the power of video on Twitter, Converse delivered original content from Miley Cyrus and Maisie Williams through its new mixtape-inspired series, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPublic Access.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nVideo optimization \u00e2\u0080\u009cFeed-first\u00e2\u0080\u009d is inspired by the notion that the legacy way of creating TV ads does not translate to a model where people are scrolling through Tweets on their mobile phones. Marketers have to break through the clutter by engineering content that creates \u00e2\u0080\u009cstopping power\u00e2\u0080\u009d and maximizes impact. Research with Omnicom showed that a 15-second ad on Twitter is just as effective as a 30-second ad on TV for stimulating a memory response.\u00c2\u00a0  Video ads are Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top-selling format, but not every advertiser has the time, resources, or insights to create Twitter-specific ads. In response, we rolled out #Fuel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s editing services to optimize creative without losing impact for Twitter In-Stream Video Ads, Promoted Video, and ads that run in live-streaming. This service can also be leveraged in conjunction with Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s research team for performance analytics. To date, early results show lift in brand metrics performing above benchmarks.\nBank of America leveraged #Fuel's editing service for a new campaign:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe recently worked with the #Fuel team for our \u00e2\u0080\u009cPay Back a Friend Day\u00e2\u0080\u009d campaign, and were impressed by the speed and quality of the work.

Today we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing the Video Website Card, a creative format that combines the power of video with the ability to drive users back to a site to learn more or take action in the moment.  The Video Website Card is designed to work across a variety of brand objectives, as well as in the gray spaces that often exist between objectives. So whether a brand is pairing the Video Website Card with the high reach of First View to announce a product launch, inviting travelers to click through to learn more about a featured destination, or showcasing game play to drive advance sales of a new video game, the Video Website Card removes friction for the consumer to engage, learn, or convert at their own rate.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWith the Video Website Card, businesses can:\nAttract qualified consumers with immersive auto-playing video showcasing their brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value, product, or service before a person clicks through. Overall in the beta, the Video Website Card achieved a 2X higher clickthrough rate than the industry benchmark for mobile video ads. Gupta Media (@GuptaMedia) partnered across several beta clients, including Republic Records (@RepublicRecords), who used the Video Website Card to drive digital streams of hip-hop artist Amin\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0099s (@heyamine) debut album \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood For You.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe Video Website Card allowed us to utilize eye-catching clips from Amin\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0099s music video to capture attention in user timelines and link them directly to Spotify where they could listen to the full track. We drove 53K clicks to Spotify at $0.04 cost per click \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and saw a bonus 303K video views.

By bridging this experience, we saw a significant reduction in the number of users who quickly abandoned the site while it was still loading. In fact, beta participants saw an average 60% increase in user retention over industry averages.\nJaguar USA (@JaguarUSA) used this format to hook users with a video featuring the sleek design of the F-type, and then invited them to learn more on their site. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe Video Website Card allowed us to visually showcase the new 2018 Jaguar F-TYPE and also direct consumers to the site to explore its features and start to build their own. The experience of allowing the user to continue to watch the video while the site loaded was sleek and drove 25% more efficient traffic to our website compared to using a static image.\nBrady Fain\nSocial Media Specialist, Jaguar Land Rover North America\n(Source: 1.Twitter internal data; eMarketer video ad CTR benchmark on mobile, Q2 2017; 2.

We realized early on that in order to better serve our users, the makeup of our company has to reflect not only the openness and global nature of the platform, but also the diversity of our users. Living up to this responsibility, and to continue engaging with our community, we joined this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s #HispanicHeritage celebration.\nEvery year, from September 15th to October 15th, the United States celebrates the positive influence that the Hispanic community has had on American society. This year, although the Hispanic community is going through tumultuous political times, this known vibrant community can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be stopped from celebrating its roots and contributions to US culture. This is, however, without setting aside its most pressing issue: immigration reforms.\nAround the company, the theme ran true with various events. San Francisco, hosted a Fireside Chat with the amazing Latinx advocate and former White House aid to President Obama, Alejandra Campoverdi (@ACampoverdi). New York, will be hosting a \u00e2\u0080\u009cLatinx Marketing Panel\u00e2\u0080\u009d on October 5th, to discuss the importance and influence of this growing audience for marketers.

For this reason, the highlight of our event was a panel hosted with the purpose of discussing the influence of Hispanics in US culture, media, and politics. Yet, the conversation focused on immigration, and the issues that immigrants, especially those from Latin America, are currently facing.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe had the pleasure of hosting Michelin Awarded Chef Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Andr\u00c3\u00a9s (@ChefJoseAndres); seven-time Emmy Award Winner and White House Correspondent for Univision, Janet Rodr\u00c3\u00adguez (@JanRodriguezTV); and senior advisor at the Carlos Slim Foundation and former Mayor of Nogales, Arizona, Marco Lopez (@1MarcoLopez).\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe discussion began with our panelists sharing their stories of how they \u00e2\u0080\u0098crossed the border\u00e2\u0080\u0099, which were not the dramatic and nostalgic tales that you would expect. Janet Rodriguez came from Cuba when she was 12, and she remembers getting ready for this move through her young years in Cuba.

Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Andr\u00c3\u00a9s on his part came from Spain as a cook, and although he faced some paperwork issues, he was finally sponsored and obtained his Green Card.\nOur panelists, as many other Hispanics, have stayed close to their roots, and used the different means they have, given their profession and networks, to support the later generations of immigrants that have come to the US.\nGetting more specific on their areas of expertise, Janet Rodriguez highlighted the importance of accurate and neutral journalism: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to be really careful and responsible, and aware that these news affect real people's lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She also mentioned the importance of social media, as a tool for immigrants and especially now for DACA kids to raise their voices and tell their stories.\nSpeaking about the influence of immigrants in the US, Jos\u00c3\u00a9 Andr\u00c3\u00a9s pointed out that there was no other place where you could find more diversity than in the United States: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is truly a melting pot and it's a beautiful thing to see. America embraces immigration, it has become what it is because it is a nation of immigrants that embraces differences. Let's put aside the negative voices that say immigration is not good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTo close up, Marco Lopez reminded us that, although the topic of immigration reform is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening, Hispanic heritage is not about pinpointing the issues of the Hispanic community in the US. It is about celebrating Hispanic tradition and culture, and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cimmigration is not what defines us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nTwitter allows us to learn, tell stories, and connect, and there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a more appropriate time to highlight these attributes than during a month to celebrate the cultural diversity that makes us who we are. As we approach the end of Hispanic Heritage Month, we hope the public and open nature of our platform keeps empowering voices, and provoking a greater understanding of the needs and expectations of our society \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot in spite of our differences, but because of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Building a more inclusive Twitter in 2016).\nOur inspiring panel was live streamed on Periscope.

{"date": "Thursday, 28 September 2017", "title": "Update: Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election", "topic": "Company", "author": "", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2017/Update-Russian-Interference-in-2016--Election-Bots-and-Misinformation", "post_text": "Company\nUpdate: Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election\nThursday, 28 September 2017\nLink copied successfully\nEarlier this summer we outlined some of our work to combat bots and networks of manipulation on Twitter. Since then, we have received a number of questions about how malicious bots and misinformation networks on Twitter may have been used in the context of the 2016 US presidential elections.\nTwitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, which is a cornerstone for all democracies. We will continue to strengthen Twitter against attempted manipulation, including malicious automated accounts and spam, as well as other activities that violate our Terms of Service.\nTwitter is in dialogue with congressional committees with respect to investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Today, Twitter Vice President for Public Policy Colin Crowell met with staff from Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to discuss these issues. This is an ongoing process and we will continue to collaborate with investigators.\nDue to the nature of these inquiries, we may not always be able to publicly share what we discuss with investigators. And there will always be tools or methods we cannot talk about, because doing so would only help bad actors circumvent them. But we know there is a huge appetite for more transparency into how Twitter fights bots and manipulative networks. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do our best to keep you informed of both our findings on these specific issues and, more broadly, our efforts to fight bots, spam, and malicious information networks on Twitter.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note our work to fight both malicious bots and misinformation goes beyond any one specific election, event, or time period. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spent years working to identify and remove spammy or malicious accounts and applications on Twitter. And we continue to improve our internal systems to detect and prevent new forms of spam and malicious automation, in real time, while also expanding our efforts to educate the public on how to identify and use quality content on Twitter.\nToday we are sharing a lot of information that is meant for a wide range of audiences. There are many ways to approach these issues, whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a concerned US voter, a journalist, a developer, etc. We are sharing as much as we can at this stage because of our commitment to be as transparent as possible.\nWith hundreds of millions of Tweets globally every day, scaling these efforts continues to be a challenge. We will continue to look into these matters on an ongoing basis, and we fully anticipate having more to share as we look into further requests for information. Here are some initial findings that we would like to share publicly at this stage:\nOur Internal Inquiries\nOf the roughly 450 accounts that Facebook recently shared as a part of their review, we concluded that 22 had corresponding accounts on Twitter. All of those identified accounts had already been or immediately were suspended from Twitter for breaking our rules, most for violating our prohibitions against spam.\nIn addition, from those accounts we found an additional 179 related or linked accounts, and took action on the ones we found in violation of our rules. Neither the original accounts shared by Facebook, nor the additional related accounts we identified, were registered as advertisers on Twitter. However, we continue to investigate these issues, and will take action on anything that violates our Terms of Service.\nRussia Today\nThe US intelligence community released a report in January, 2017, highlighting the role that RT (Russia Today), which has strong links to the Russian government, allegedly played in seeking to interfere in the 2016 US election and undermine trust in American democracy. RT has accounts on Twitter and tweets regularly. The open nature of the Twitter platform means this activity was public.\nToday we proactively shared with committee staff a round-up of ads that three RT accounts (@RT_com, @RT_America, and @ActualidadRT) targeted to the US market in 2016. As of our meetings today we believe this is the complete list from these three accounts within that time frame, but we are continuing to review our internal data and will report back to the committees as we have more to share.\nBased on our findings thus far, RT spent $274,100 in US ads in 2016. \u00c2\u00a0In that year, the @RT_com, @RT_America, and @ActualidadRT accounts promoted 1,823 Tweets that definitely or potentially targeted the US market. These campaigns were directed at followers of mainstream media and primarily promoted RT Tweets regarding news stories.\nElection Vote Issues\nWe are concerned about violations of our Terms of Service and US law with respect to interference in the exercise of voting rights. When we become aware of such activity we take appropriate and timely action. During the 2016 election, we removed Tweets that were attempting to suppress or otherwise interfere with the exercise of voting rights, including the right to have a vote counted, by circulating intentionally misleading information.\nFor instance: when we were alerted to Hillary Clinton \u00e2\u0080\u009ctext-to-vote\u00e2\u0080\u009d examples, we proactively tweeted reminders that one cannot vote via text, examined the content reported to us, used our proprietary tools to search for linked accounts that violated our rules, and, after careful review, took action on thousands of Tweets and accounts. We have not found accounts associated with this activity to have obvious Russian origin but some of the accounts appear to have been automated. We have shared examples of the content of these removed Tweets with congressional investigators.\nPolitical Advertising Disclosure\nWe note recent calls for increased public disclosure with respect to political advertisements on social media, including Twitter. Twitter supports making political advertising more transparent to our users and the public.\nInternally, we already have stricter policies for advertising campaigns on Twitter than we do for organic content. We also have existing specific policies and review mechanisms for campaign ads, but will examine them with an eye to improving them. We welcome the opportunity to work with the FEC and leaders in Congress to review and strengthen guidelines for political advertising on social media.\nAutomated Traffic & Spam\nEvery online platform has to deal with spam, and there is no silver bullet. For example, the Internet Society estimated in October 2015 that up to 85 percent of all global email is spam -- and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s after decades of every email platform in the world tackling this challenge. Obviously email is very different from Tweets, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to understand the scale of what we are dealing with, and that this is a global issue for all platforms.\nRussia and other post-Soviet states have been a primary source of automated and spammy content on Twitter for many years. Content that violates our rules with respect to automated accounts and spam can have a highly negative effect on user experience, and we have long taken substantial action to stem that flow.\nAs patterns of malicious activity evolve, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re adapting to meet them head-on. On average, our automated systems catch more than 3.2 million suspicious accounts globally per week \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than double the amount we detected this time last year. As our detection of automated accounts and content has improved, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re better able to catch malicious accounts when they log into Twitter or first start to create spam. We have not and do not include spam accounts that we have identified in the active user numbers that we report to shareholders. As we have said, we estimate that false or spam accounts represent less than 5% of our MAUs.\nThese are just some of our tools:\nThe most effective way to fight suspicious bots is stopping them before they start. To do this, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built systems to identify suspicious attempts to log in to Twitter, including signs that a login may be automated or scripted. These techniques now help us catch about 450,000 suspicious logins per day. Importantly, much of this defensive work is done through machine learning and automated processes on our back end, and we have been able to significantly improve our automatic spam and bot-detection tools, resulting in a 64% year-over-year increase in suspicious logins we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to detect.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in systems to stop bad content at its source if its point of origin corresponds with a known bad actor. However, the use of proxy servers, VPNs, and other forms of authentication, especially outside of the United States, may obscure the true origin of traffic on Twitter. We are working on better identifying the true origins of traffic and blocking activity from suspicious sources.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also improving how we detect and cluster accounts that were created by a single entity or a single suspicious source. We used these techniques to stop more than 5.7 million spammy follows from a single source just last week (9/21/2017).\nDetecting non-human activity patterns: Using signals like the frequency and timing of Tweets and engagements, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built models that can detect whether an activity on Twitter is likely automated. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expanding how we use these signals to restrict how users see suspicious accounts.\nCompromised account detection: To stop bad actors from exploiting otherwise healthy accounts to spread malicious content, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in new ways to identify potentially compromised accounts. For example, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building systems to detect when login activity is inconsistent with a user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s typical behavior, to help get compromised accounts back under the control of their owners.\nChecking suspicious content: Accounts and content detected by our systems are subject to a number of enforcement actions and limitations including: being placed in a \u00e2\u0080\u009cread only\u00e2\u0080\u009d mode pending authentication, having the reach of Tweets limited based on suspicious origin or low quality content, the removal of associated content, and account suspension.\nThird-party apps: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also continuing to invest in proactively identifying and taking action against applications that violate our developer policies -- including bots and automated apps. While some bots can provide a vital public utility in times of crisis and natural disaster, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to combatting the minority of apps that create spam and abuse via our API. Since June 2017, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve suspended more than 117,000 malicious applications for abusing our API, collectively responsible for more than 1.5 billion low-quality Tweets this year.\nPreventing false positives: Any automated system for detecting spam or bots has a chance of false positives, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our goal to bring this as low as possible. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we typically give users caught by our spam detections an opportunity to verify that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re legitimate before we suspend them from the platform. During this window, accounts may still appear on Twitter and via our public API, even though they are not able to create new Tweets and engagements. We also limit the visibility of these accounts and their content in both Search and Trends.\nImproving phone verification: When we detect suspicious activity from an account, we may require that user to verify their phone number to regain access to Twitter. But, as spammers have adapted their techniques, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found that not all phone numbers are equally trustworthy. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve improved our phone reputation system to identify suspicious carriers and numbers and prevent their repeated use to pass verification challenges.\nA note about third-party research:\nStudies of the impact of bots and automation on Twitter necessarily and systematically under-represent our enforcement actions because these defensive actions are not visible via our API, and because they take place shortly after content is created and delivered via our streaming API. Furthermore, researchers using an API often overlook the substantial in-product features that prioritize the most relevant content. Based on user interests and choices, we limit the visibility of low-quality content using tools such as Quality Filter and Safe Search -- both of which are on by default for all of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s users and active for more than 97% of users.\nHuman-Directed Accounts\nWhile we have made important progress addressing spam and other forms of malicious automation on Twitter, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve identified new and emerging challenges dealing with non-automated content -- i.e., human-directed accounts instead of bots -- that coordinate their activities to spread information.\nWhen large numbers of human-directed accounts act in coordinated fashion, it can have an effect similar to that of spam. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that these accounts aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t violating our Terms of Service -- in some cases, they are -- but we have to approach this problem differently than we do bots and other forms of automated content. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much trickier to identify non-automated coordination, and the risks of inadvertently silencing legitimate activity are much higher. We are continuing to work on this, and are committed to getting better at it.\nGaming Trending Topics\nAttempting to game trending topics is a practice as old as Trends on Twitter themselves, and over the years we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve invested heavily in thwarting spam and other automated attempts to manipulate Trends. We take active measures to protect against trend gaming, such as excluding automated Tweets and users from our calculations of a Trend.\nImportantly, as spammers change their tactics we actively modify our technological tools to address such situations. Since June 2017, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to detect an average of 130,000 accounts per day who are attempting to manipulate Trends -- and have taken steps to prevent that impact. This is an area where saying more about those steps would only help bad actors, but we will keep looking for new ways to illustrate with examples the important progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made on this front.\nElectoral Outreach\nWe engage with national election commissions regularly and consistently bolster our security and agent review coverage during key moments of election cycles around the world. We will continue to do this, and expand our outreach so that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got strong, clear escalation processes in place for all potentialities during major elections and global political events.\nSupporting Media Literacy and Accurate Emergency Information\nIn our increasingly polarized public sphere, we believe developing critical media skills is more important than ever. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we are creating a dedicated media literacy program to demonstrate how Twitter can be an indispensable educational tool. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also sponsoring, contributing to, and hosting a Media Literacy Week in some of our key markets.\nFrom the Zika Virus to Hurricane Harvey, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time nature is vital in emergency scenarios and can save lives. We want to ensure factual information is elevated across our platform in times of crisis. As part of our flagship philanthropic initiative, we continue to fund promoted campaigns, called Ads for Good, that promote disaster relief efforts and elevate vital communication from reliable sources during emergencies.\nFinally, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our formal partnerships with Bloomberg News, or our journalistic NGO training and outreach with the likes of Reporters without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, we have redoubled our engagement on critical questions of modern journalism. We will continue to work with reporters and media organizations to ensure that Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s real-time capacity for dispelling untruths is built into the approach of newsrooms and established media outlets worldwide.\nNext Steps\nOver the coming weeks and months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be rolling out several changes to the actions we take when we detect spammy or suspicious activity, including introducing new and escalating enforcements for suspicious logins, Tweets, and engagements, and shortening the amount of time suspicious accounts remain visible on Twitter while pending confirmation. These are not meant to be definitive solutions. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fighting against these issues for years, and as long as there are people trying to manipulate Twitter, we will be working hard to stop them.\nTwitter is where the world goes to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. We are a platform founded on a commitment to transparency and we take that legacy and responsibility seriously. We will continue to work with official inquiries into these issues, and to share updates publicly as we are able.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nNational Disability Employment Awareness Month 2020 with Twitter Able\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 30 October 2020\n          \nHispanic Heritage Month 2020 recap\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 22 October 2020\n          "}

What better way to reinforce these principles than registering to vote, so that you can make your voice heard on Election Day?\nThis year, local elections are happening in all 50 states across the U.S. And for the second year in a row, Twitter partnered with National Voter Registration Day (@NatlVoterRegDay) to host a discussion about the importance of staying connected, both online and in the polling booth, in celebration of this national day of action. We convened panelists and audience members from government, corporate, and nonprofit sectors at our DC office to share insights on the importance of ongoing political engagement-- with the first step always being voter registration.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThrough our conversation in person and online between representatives from Rock The Vote, BET, National League of Cities, and National Association of State Election Directors, we heard the experts trade best practices about voter registration efforts. The common challenge-- and opportunity-- is finding voters where they organically spend their time, to get them both to register and turn out at the polls. In 2017, that means going to social media platforms like Twitter to connect with eligible voters and helping them register to vote.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThere was a lot of conversation around ensuring that youth and college students know how powerful their voices are and how important it is for young people to vote and be engaged with their communities. Local elections have a strong, tangible impact on their communities, and are are the strongest way to let your local officials know what matters to you. City leaders have a duty to keep their constituents informed both with changes to voting and to affirm your right to participate in the electoral process. A key strategy recommendation for staying in the know, and being a part of the action was to simply stay engaged on Twitter.  \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEqual access to pertinent information is a key component in participating in a democracy.

This discussion illustrates how essential Twitter is to keep users informed about their local leaders, rights as a voter, and ways to get involved with the electoral process.

For example, when I (Aliza) Tweet in English, I quickly run into the 140 character limit and have to edit my Tweet down so it fits. Sometimes, I have to remove a word that conveys an important meaning or emotion, or I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t send my Tweet at all. But when Iku Tweets in Japanese, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the same problem. He finishes sharing his thought and still has room to spare. This is because in languages like Japanese, Korean, and Chinese you can convey about double the amount of information in one character as you can in many other languages, like English, Spanish, Portuguese, or French. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nWe want every person around the world to easily express themselves on Twitter, so we're doing something new: we're going to try out a longer limit, 280 characters, in languages impacted by cramming (which is all except Japanese, Chinese, and Korean). \n\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough this is only available to a small group right now, we want to be transparent about why we are excited to try this. Here are some of our findings:\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe see that a small percent of Tweets sent in Japanese have 140 characters (only 0.4%). But in English, a much higher percentage of Tweets have 140 characters (9%). Most Japanese Tweets are 15 characters while most English Tweets are 34. Our research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people Tweeting in English, but it is not for those Tweeting in Japanese. Also, in all markets, when people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people Tweeting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 which is awesome! \n\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough we feel confident about our data and the positive impact this change will have, we want to try it out with a small group of people before we make a decision to launch to everyone. What matters most is that this works for our community \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we will be collecting data and gathering feedback along the way. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re hoping fewer Tweets run into the character limit, which should make it easier for everyone to Tweet.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter is about brevity. It's what makes it such a great way to see what's happening. Tweets get right to the point with the information or thoughts that matter. That is something we will never change. \n We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we felt it, too. But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint. We are excited to share this today, and we will keep you posted about what we see and what comes next. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Here are 140 (left) and 280 (right) character Tweets in the timeline. \u00a0\n          \n          \n        \n          \n            Showing the same Tweet in different languages. \u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ndata\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nMeasure your launch and connect campaigns using Twitter Brand Surveys\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 3 December 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available globally\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 21 November 2019\n          \nIntroducing Topics\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 11 November 2019\n          \nMore control over your conversations: now available in Japan and the US!\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 19 September 2019\n          "}

They \u00c2\u00a0can provide real-time information on many issues including the cost of food, availability of jobs, access to health care, quality of education, and reports of natural disasters. There are few places on earth as prolific with Twitter usage than the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. \nAs the United Nations, its member states and its peoples, pursue the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we need to make much better use of the treasure troves of insights captured in big data sources to measure progress against these global goals. Drawing on the agreement signed between the United Nations Global Pulse (@UNGlobalPulse) and Twitter in 2016 to support efforts to achieve the SDGs, Pulse Lab Jakarta (@PulseLabJakarta), a data innovation lab of the United Nations and the Government of Indonesia and part of the UN Global Pulse network, used Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data stream to test a new method that has the potential to turn social conversations on Twitter into actionable information for city administrations.\n@PulseLabJakarta, partnered with the team from Jakarta Smart City (@JSCLounge) and the Indonesian Institute of Statistics to look at whether aggregated data from social media could help provide information on the movements of commuters within the Greater Jakarta area in order to better inform public officials on daily commuter patterns so as to optimize public transport.\nTransport policy in a megacity\nJabodetabek, as locals fondly refer to the Greater Jakarta area, includes the settlements of Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi. Jakarta, itself, is split into five administrative cities: North, South, East, West and Central. Population estimates for the settlements range from 10 million for Jakarta, to over 30 million for the broader metropolitan area.\nThe scale of the population and the state of the transport infrastructure makes the daily commute a common complaint among residents. The city administration is working to improve the commuting experience with significant investments in transport infrastructure, such as the new Jakarta MRT.\nTo inform these infrastructure investments and to understand the rhythm of the city, the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics conducted the first Jakarta commuting survey in 2014. The survey filled an initial data gap, but from design to delivery, it was one year before the results were available.\nFilling the data gaps\nThe challenge of data relevance in urban planning is not unique to Jakarta, and has spurred many attempts to use other types of data to produce similar statistics. The most promising projects use geolocated information such as GPS devices, sensors, social media and mobile phone data.\nIn Indonesia, social media is recognised as a promising data source to understand macro patterns of human behaviour while protecting individual privacy. This is especially true of Jakarta, once dubbed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwitter Capital of the World\u00e2\u0080\u009d due to the millions of Tweets generated in the city every day. @PulseLabJakarta used this opportunity to test whether the locational information from social media can reveal commuting patterns in the Greater Jakarta area.\nFirst we produced Origin-Destination statistics for the ten cities in Greater Jakarta from accounts of users who voluntarily included geolocation information in their Tweets and then analyzed the nature of the commutes between such geographic areas.\nSecond, we calibrated the initial result based on the population distribution and Twitter usage distribution.\nFinally, we verified the result with the official commuting statistics produced by the Indonesian Bureau of Statistics.\nOrigin-destination analysis\nWe collected all location-stamped Tweets posted in Greater Jakarta from Twitter data sets and subsetted Tweets posted between 1st January 2014 and 30th May 2014, considering that the official commuting survey was conducted during the first quarter of 2014.\nAnalyzing de-personalized usage patterns, we inferred two locations: origin and destination, both at sub-district level. Origin location was inferred as the most Tweeted sub-district location between 9:00 pm and 7:00 am. Destination location was determined as the most Tweeted sub-district location during weekdays, excluding the origin location.\nUsing this approach, among the 1,456,927 unique users who voluntarily posted location-stamped Tweets in Greater Jakarta during the five months from January 2014, we found the origin and destination information for 305,761 users at the sub-district level (i.e. we were not zooming in any further). This represents about 2.8 per cent of the whole population, and 14 per cent of the commuting population in Greater Jakarta.\nDue to the unequal penetration rates of Twitter, we mapped the origin-destination information at sub-district level to city level, and calibrated the information based on the population data from the ten cities. After calibration, the cross correlation score between the two forms of statistics, official statistics and the statistics from our approach, improved from 0.92 to 0.97.\nThe chord diagram shows that Twitter is a promising source of data for inferring commuting statistics in Greater Jakarta.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Chord diagram: official commuter flows (left), commuting statistics inferred from Twitter (right)\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nResults in full\nTable C shows the rank difference between official statistics from the Community Survey (Table A) and the information inferred from Twitter (Table B). \u00c2\u00a0This table suggests that the approach produces broadly reliable predictions. For instance, the value for SJ \u00e2\u0087\u0092 CJ is calculated as \u00e2\u0080\u00980\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because the two statistics are the same. \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            (Left to right) Table A: Official statistics from the Commuting Survey 2014 on the per cent of commuters from the ten cities in Greater Jakarta to the five cities in Jakarta. Table B: Commuting Stats\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nPulse Lab Jakarta is working to improve the method with better calibration using other demographic variables, as well as expanding research by analysing commuting data from Transjakarta, which is the Bus Rapid Transit system in Jakarta.\nThis research was originally presented at NetMob 2017, a conference on the scientific analysis of mobile phone datasets, and more recently at the Asia-Pacific Economic Statistics Week. Our partner in this research, the Institute of Statistics, which is part of Statistics Indonesia, is planning to use this method to enhance commuting statistics produced by the Government henceforth.\nWe are pleased to be able to showcase how our partnership with Twitter using #DataforGood is making a positive contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals and we are delighted to be able to work with the Government of Indonesia and partners from the UN to harness new digital data sources for better decision making.\n* Pulse Lab Jakarta is a data innovation lab that works to leverage new digital data sources for development and humanitarian action.

In March of 2017, we introduced a new section covering government TOS reports, but it was limited to government requests to remove content under our prohibition of the promotion of terrorism. Today, we have expanded this section to cover a broader array of categories under the Twitter Rules, adding: abusive behavior, copyright, and trademark.\nGovernment TOS reports filed under areas covered by the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Abusive Behavior\u00e2\u0080\u0099 section of the Twitter Rules accounted for 98% of global government TOS reports. We took action in response to 13% of these requests, with the majority of requests resulting in no content removal. This was due to a variety of reasons, such as the reporter failing to identify content on Twitter or our investigation finding that the reported content did not violate our Terms. As we take an objective approach to processing global Terms of Service reports, the fact that the reporters in these cases happened to be government officials had no bearing on whether any action was taken under our Rules.\nRemoving terrorist content\nThe second largest volume, a little more than 2% of global reports, fell within the promotion of terrorism category. Under this category of reports, we are referring to accounts that actively incite or promote violence associated with internationally recognized terrorist organizations, promote internationally recognized terrorist organizations, and accounts attempting to evade prior enforcement.\nTwitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued commitment to eliminate such activity from our platform has resulted in an 80% reduction in accounts reported by governments compared to the previous reporting period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. Notably, government requests accounted for less than 1% of account suspensions for the promotion of terrorism during the first half of this year. Instead, 95% of these account suspensions were the result of our internal efforts to combat this content with proprietary tools, up from 74% in our last Transparency Report. Between accounts surfaced by both our internal tools and government reports, Twitter removed 299,649 accounts during this reporting period, a 20% drop from the previous reporting period. Notably, 75% of these accounts were suspended before posting their first Tweet.\nWe have suspended a total of 935,897 accounts for the promotion of terrorism in the period of August 1, 2015 through June 30, 2017. For more details, please refer to our latest government TOS reports section.\nIncreasing transparency\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also updated the remainder of our biannual report with data covering January through June, 2017. During this time, Twitter received 6% more global government requests for account information that affected 3% fewer accounts than in the previous period, including requests that originated from four new countries: Nepal, Paraguay, Panama, and Uruguay. In addition, we received approximately 3% more global legal requests to remove content impacting 8% more accounts compared to the previous reporting period. These included requests from nine new countries: Bahrain, Croatia, Finland, Nepal, Paraguay, Poland, Qatar, Ukraine, and Uruguay.\nBroadening and deepening our US transparency reporting\nIn addition, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve continued to expand our US country report. In this latest version, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve included a breakdown of California state information requests at the county level, with plans to introduce this section to other states in future reports. Notably, Los Angeles County came in as the top requesting county, submitting 44% of total California state information requests. Providing this increased level of granularity should further help our users get a better idea of how frequently their local authorities seek user account information.\nUS law and #Transparency\nAs in past reports, Twitter is not reporting national security requests in the bands mandated by the USAFA. Where gag orders on National Security Letters have been lifted, we have included the actual numbers of requests. With regard to other national security requests we may have received, we continue to litigate government restrictions preventing us from sharing more granular information in our case Twitter v. Sessions (f.k.a. Twitter v. Lynch). In February 2017, a hearing was held on the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s motion for summary judgment, where the US government argued that the case should be decided in its favor because it had met the applicable requirements for showing that Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2014 draft Transparency Report was properly classified. On July 6, 2017, the court denied the government's motion for a summary judgment finding that the government submission did not satisfy the requirements of the First Amendment. On September 5, 2017, the government filed a motion for reconsideration, motivated primarily by the 9th Circuit decision in \u00c2\u00a0EFF\u00e2\u0080\u0099s NSL litigation. Twitter will be filing its opposition to the government motion shortly.\nTwitter will continue to act on our commitment to #transparency, and we encourage you to read more about all these updates in our latest report.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\ndata\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

{"date": "Wednesday, 30 August 2017", "title": "#Ferguson - Three Years On", "topic": "Events", "author": "Twitter Blackbirds", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/events/2017/ferguson-third-anniversary", "post_text": "Events\n#Ferguson - Three Years On\n            By\n            \n  \n  \nWednesday, 30 August 2017\nLink copied successfully\nThis month marks the third anniversary of the Ferguson protests, which began following the fatal shooting of Mike Brown. For nearly three weeks, people from all around the world gathered on Twitter to reflect and report on what was happening in Missouri.\nWe asked people who were in Ferguson at the time about their experiences during the summer of 2014, and how they used Twitter to tell their story.\nWesley Lowery, Washington Post national reporter\nLowery is a Washington Post reporter, who recently published a book on his experiences covering Ferguson. His reporting on police brutality for the Post won him a Pulitzer Prize in 2016.\nBrittany Packnett, Social activist\nPacknett is a St. Louis native. She co-founded Campaign Zero, a comprehensive policy platform to end police violence, and served as a member of President Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 21st Century Policing Taskforce.\nFor many people around the world, your Tweets allowed them to stay informed during the protests in Ferguson. Why was Twitter where you chose to share this story?\nWesley Lowery: Twitter was the medium where this story was playing out \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the photos and text accounts of the shooting itself had been published, and where live updates each night of the protests were living. Ferguson, more than any other story I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve covered, felt like it was playing out primarily on Twitter, and so it was only appropriate to utilize it heavily in my reporting.\nBrittany Packnett: Twitter, above all other platforms, allowed us to be quick, informative and truthful. We could report the truth of what was happening on the street and counteract the problematic reporting coming from mainstream media. Twitter saved our lives: without live streaming and support coming from around the world, there were many nights our lives were in jeopardy-and we could have been fatally harmed and have the police report it was our fault.\nWhile you were in Ferguson, in the thick of it, or even from a distance, what was a way you used Twitter that you would not have originally anticipated?\nWL: What a lot of folks not on the ground didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize was the pure scope of the demonstrations. There were days where there were more than a thousand people in the street from the afternoon until the early hours of the morning. And the gatherings stretched for blocks, making it hard to explain everything that was happening at all times. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotest\u00e2\u0080\u009d could consist of a church group singing hymns in one spot, and then another group calmly discussing politics in another spot, and then an officer arguing with some young men somewhere else, and then at the other end of the street someone throwing rocks. As a reporter, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible to be in all of those places at the same time, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still my responsibility to account for the totality of what is happening on the ground. Twitter allowed me to follow closely the accounts of other folks \u00e2\u0080\u0093 reporters, activists, residents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who may have a different vantage point that I did, allowing me to gain understanding from what they were documenting in real time.\nBP: I knew to use Twitter and hashtags to get the word out \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I did not anticipate how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be able to receive resources and advice from people all across the world. When I learned what to do after we were tear gassed, it was because people from Palestine taught us how. \u00c2\u00a0Sadly, what we endured is a more typical in several corners of the world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and they knew better how to handle these chemical agents than we did. Cards, letters, funds, food, cold weather gear \u00e2\u0080\u0093 all that and more sustained us, because of the ways in which the Twitter community showed up for us.\nHow is / was Twitter a tool for your advocacy?\nWL: In a story like Ferguson, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvocacy\u00e2\u0080\u009d role of the press is one of advocating for more information. What we, as well as so many of the people of Ferguson, wanted during those early days was an explanation: Why was this young man dead? What had happened? Who was the officer? What evidence was available? Those questions typically are asked in emails and press conferences, but what Twitter allowed was for them to be asked publicly \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in open spaces, where those inquires could be magnified and where public pressure could build.\nBP: Protest is telling the truth out loud and in public: we can tell an uninterrupted and unapologetic truth through Twitter. \u00c2\u00a0We can chart our own course, dictate our own terms, and be independent of any other interests, ensuring that our truth is free, just as we fight to be.\nHow do you think that the events of three years ago changed the way people use Twitter, if any?\nBP: People began to realize that \u00e2\u0080\u009chashtag activism\u00e2\u0080\u009d has real power. \u00c2\u00a0It is not an inactive, latent contribution-it is active participation. Everyone who Tweeted #Ferguson or #MikeBrown helped us put pressure on everyone from the White House to presidential candidates to mayors, governors and the media. Without each Tweet, the consistent killing of Black and Brown people by the police would not have been mainstream media, as it is today. \u00c2\u00a0Each follow, each Tweet, each Retweet was a choice-and a declaration that black lives do indeed matter to millions of people. \u00c2\u00a0  \nAfter three years, where do we go from here?\nWL: One of the things birthed of Ferguson was a new effort to quantify police violence. The unrest in Ferguson and elsewhere prompted multiple attempts to begin comprehensively tracking fatal encounters with police, including the fatal police shooting database launched by myself and my colleagues at The Washington Post. We now know much more than we did in 2014 about the frequency of police shootings, who is being killed, and under what circumstances. That said, the number of shootings remains relatively flat. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very likely that about the same number of people will be killed by police this year as the year Mike Brown was killed. Having the data is one step, but what comes next is implementing action plans to address the root causes of many of these fatal encounters \u00e2\u0080\u0093 police training and resourcing, the availability of firearms, mental health, and implicit bias.\nBP: We keep pressing. \u00c2\u00a0With love and with power: forward, always.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nOfficial Twitter Blog\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\n#SaferInternetDay 2020: Creating a better internet for all\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 February 2020\n          \nHow the @Chiefs #SuperBowl victory played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 3 February 2020\n          \n#KpopTwitter rises to the top with 6.1 billion global Tweets in 2019\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 17 January 2020\n          \n#WorldCupDraw conversation is happening on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 30 November 2017\n          "}

We were working frantically to fix a tech issue that had brought Twitter down, as was often the case in those early days.\nMany iconic features of Twitter have been created over the years by listening and watching what people who use Twitter do with it and then working to make it easier and better for them\u00e2\u0080\u0094we still do this today. Back in those early days, Jack and I even published our phone numbers on the front page. So, although we were somewhat frenzied, we wanted to give Chris a few minutes and hear him out.\nHis proposal was simple, useful, and fun\u00e2\u0080\u0094just like Twitter. Because brevity is essential on Twitter, he suggested using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpound\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009chash\u00e2\u0080\u009d character common on phones (this was pre-iPhone) to create groups of related Tweets. It was an undeniably elegant proposal, but I really needed to get back to work. I turned back to my computer screen to help get Twitter back up and running, hurriedly ending the conversation with a sarcastic, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get right on that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThankfully, Chris didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take offense to my reaction, he simply started doing what he had proposed. On August 23rd, 2007, the hashtag came into existence with this Tweet and eventually caught on across the platform. We hyperlinked hashtags on Twitter making them easier and better for all.\nSince it first appeared on Twitter, the hashtag has dramatically evolved \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from grouping Tweets, to adding quirky commentary, to sparking social movements and global conversations. Using hashtags on Twitter, people worldwide have made this platform their microphone, shaped culture, and changed the world.\nCombined with the power and influence of Twitter, the hashtag empowers everyone to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world and what people are talking about. It allows people from all over the planet to share their voice and join global conversations. When something happens in the world, it happens on Twitter.\nHappy tenth birthday, hashtag. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re glad we never called you by your technically correct name, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOctothorp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhttps://twitter.com/Twitter/status/900327630863577089 \n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\n#Hashtag10\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ntrends\nmovements\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nFleets: a new way to join the conversation\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 November 2020\n          \nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nTransparency around image cropping and changes to come \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 1 October 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          "}

Building on the work started within the EU Internet Forum and the\u00c2\u00a0shared industry hash database, the GIFCT is fostering collaboration with smaller tech companies, civil society groups and academics, and governments.\nIn addition to the founding companies of the GIFCT, more than two dozen other technology companies and NGOs will be participating in Tuesday's meeting. We also welcome\u00c2\u00a0United Kingdom Home Secretary Rt Hon Amber Rudd MP and United States Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke\u00c2\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 as well as representatives from Australia, Canada, the European Union, and the United Nations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to discuss mutual areas of cooperation.\nAt Tuesday's meeting we will be\u00c2\u00a0formalizing our goals for collaboration\u00c2\u00a0and identifying, alongside smaller companies, the specific areas of support needed as part of the GIFCT's core workplan. Our mission is to substantially disrupt terrorists' ability to use the Internet in furthering their causes, while also respecting human rights. This disruption includes addressing the promotion of terrorism, dissemination of propaganda, and the exploitation of real-world events through online platforms. To achieve this, we will join forces around three strategies:\u00c2\u00a0\nEmploying and leveraging technology\nSharing knowledge, information and best practices, and\nConducting and funding research\nIn the next several months, we also aim to achieve the following:\nSecure the participation of five additional companies to the industry hash-sharing database for violent terrorist imagery; two of which have already joined: Snap Inc. and Justpaste.it\nReach 50 companies\u00c2\u00a0to share best practices on how to counter terrorism online through the\u00c2\u00a0Tech Against Terrorism\u00c2\u00a0project in partnership with ICT4Peace and the UN Counter Terrorism Executive Directorate\nConduct four knowledge-sharing workshops \u00e2\u0080\u0094 starting in San Francisco today, with plans for further meetings later this year in other locations around the world\nWe believe that the\u00c2\u00a0best approach to tackling online terrorism is to collaborate\u00c2\u00a0with each other and with external actors, including civil society and government.

First, we conducted research to understand the issues at a deeper level, then we made a range of product updates. We then convened our Trust and Safety Council to gather feedback and help guide us as we move forward.  While there is still much work to be done, people are experiencing significantly less abuse on Twitter today than they were six months ago. What follows is some new data on the progress we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made, what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned, and our plans to continue improving.  Increasing Action on Abusive Accounts  We promised to do more with our technology. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now taking action on 10x the number of abusive accounts every day compared to the same time last year. We also now limit account functionality or place suspensions on thousands more abusive accounts each day.  There are repeat offenders who create new accounts after being suspended for violations. Our new systems, in the last four months alone, have removed twice the number of these types of accounts. Beyond the technology, our teams are continuing to review content daily and improve how we enforce our policies.  Driving Change in Behavior  Communication about problematic Tweets, especially to the people who send them, is key. Accounts that demonstrate abusive behavior are now limited for a time, and told why. Accounts that we put into this period of limited functionality generate 25% fewer abuse reports, and approximately 65% of these accounts are in this state just once.  Providing Personalized Controls  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve introduced new ways to customize your experience, including notification filters and muting keywords. Our Quality Filter has led to fewer unwanted interactions: blocks after @mentions from people you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow are down 40%. These numbers will vary, but the approach is having a positive impact.  We have consistent harassment definitions and policies that apply to everyone. However, people define abuse differently, so using these new tools, every person has control of what they see and experience on Twitter.  What Happens Next  More improvement, transparency, and speed. Online safety is an issue best solved in partnership with others, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to collaborate with our Trust & Safety Council, industry experts, and academics to solicit ongoing feedback. We are committed to making Twitter a safe place for free expression.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Product\nFleets: a new way to join the conversation\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 17 November 2020\n          \nHow it started, how it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going: Performance advertising on Twitter\n            \n            \n             Wednesday, 11 November 2020\n          \nTransparency around image cropping and changes to come \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 1 October 2020\n          \nAdding more context to Trends\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 1 September 2020\n          "}

While many took part physically, the conversation on Twitter crossed borders, uniting people from all over the world in determination. Through TwitterOpen, our LGBTQIA Employee Resource Group, we \u00c2\u00a0took a moment to measure both the progress occurring everyday and the work that still needs to be done to achieve the kind of world we strive for. As people around the world united on Twitter to celebrate and support LGBTQIA communities, we participated in and hosted events to commemorate this month.\nWe kicked off Pride Month by unveiling the new Emojis. This year the Emoji included pink and blue stripes, to reflect our allyship with Trans people, which appeared every time someone Tweeted out with #PrideIsHappening #Pride2017 \u00c2\u00a0#LoveIsLove Throughout the month, these hashtags were used over 6 million times. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOn June 2, Tech Proud, an organization which helps young LGBT people enter the tech industry, spent the day at Twitter.

This success has been built upon the Internet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open architecture, the ability of entrepreneurs to innovate without asking permission, and for such innovators to do so without fear of discrimination. \u00c2\u00a0In general, these principles mean that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are obligated to treat and transmit all bits equally, regardless of origin, content, or destination. Net Neutrality is foundational to competitive, free enterprise, entrepreneurial market entry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and reaching global customers. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to be a big shot to compete. Anyone with a great idea, a unique perspective to share, and a compelling vision can get in the game.  Without the guiding principles of Net Neutrality, it is entirely possible Twitter would not have come from a somewhat quirky experimental 140-character SMS service to where we are today, an international company with thousands of employees and a service that incorporates pictures, video, and live streaming and connects the world to every side of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.  Net Neutrality is essential for the more than 3.2 billion people across the globe who use the Internet, which touches nearly all aspects of the global economy. \u00c2\u00a0In the US economy alone, with an estimated 274 million smartphones and tablets and millions of residential and business broadband connections, the Internet fueled approximately 6% of GDP in 2014 according to a recent Internet Association economic paper.  The Open Internet rules put in place by the FCC in 2015 are based upon a solid legal framework that has been sustained by the courts. The FCC Net Neutrality rules effectively safeguard the open Internet as an engine of innovation and investment and as a global platform for free expression.  Notwithstanding the unbridled economic and innovative activity unleashed by the open Internet, the FCC is moving quickly through a rulemaking process to gut the core entrepreneurial and consumer protections that are the heart of the innovation economy.  The FCC should abandon its misguided effort to obviate all the work that has been done on behalf of all Internet users.  Supporting Free Speech and Expression Online  Free expression is part of our company DNA. \u00c2\u00a0We are the platform that lets users see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening and to see all sides. Whether it be music, sports, news or entertainment, being able to see every side of a topic makes Twitter unlike any other platform or service in the world. \u00c2\u00a0  Net Neutrality is one of the most important free expression issues of our time because without Net Neutrality, ISPs would be able to charge content providers more to access the Internet or to reach other users, frustrating the free flow of information. \u00c2\u00a0Moreover, without Net Neutrality in force, ISPs would even be able to block content they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like, reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings, and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs. This is especially critical for smaller and noncommercial voices, who would be unable to pay a new ISP broadband toll for \u00e2\u0080\u009cfast lane\u00e2\u0080\u009d service. Relegating certain content to the backwaters of the Internet in second or third-tier status reduces the visibility and impact of important voices in the local, national, or global media mix.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n*Editor's note: As of November 2017, Twitter has increased the character count of Tweets in certain languages to make it easier to share what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\ngovernment\npolicy\ntransparency\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\n#KeepItOn: Making your voice heard to end Internet shutdowns \n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 26 May 2020\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

In June we saw another great batch of market moving Tweets, covering topics ranging from mergers and acquisitions to unexpected election results. As always, our goal is to surface great insights and some of the best, most compelling content on Twitter. There is no better way to do that than letting our partners showcase the innovative solutions they build using Twitter Data and the corresponding value gained by financial professionals.\nOnce again we will be hearing from Mark Dimont (@mdimont), Product Manager for Bloomberg Terminal News Applications (@TheTerminal), who will walk us through some of the most financially relevant and compelling Tweets that occurred throughout the month.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Mark to share some insights:\n____________________________________________________________________\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great to be back on the Twitter blog showcasing some of the ways finance and social media intersect. As I mentioned back in April, at Bloomberg I send a recurring note to my colleagues called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Week in Social\u00e2\u0080\u009d that aggregates Tweets from finance that are particularly popular, novel or compelling.\nIn my last post, I focused on \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreaking\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tweets, singular moments that moved markets and stock prices. For this post, the focus will be more around unique finance-oriented moments and the macroeconomic environment from the month of June:\nCorporate/CEO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on Twitter\nAfter receiving some criticism for a perceived lack of philanthropic efforts, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and the second richest man in the world, took to Twitter to solicit ideas for how he should deploy his capital: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs of June 20, he received 41K responses but more are coming in every day and talk of him disrupting even another industry has begun.\n--\nIn June the senior executives of General Electric, one of the biggest companies in the world, used social media as an avenue to pass the baton from one CEO to the next: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n--\nIncreasingly, we see CEOs getting comfortable using social media as a forum to inform and communicate with the public, media and investors.\nAnother great example this month was when the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, joined Twitter and posted his first Tweet. The Tweet emphasized a policy disagreement with the US and set the tone for future communications:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHe followed shortly after with this: \u00c2\u00a0 \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLloyd explained his rationale for joining Twitter in a television interview. One of his noteworthy statements said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore Twitter, I did those things by press release.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMacro Finance Trends on Twitter\nIt is not just CEOs but also influential leaders in US monetary policy that communicate and engage in spirited conversation: Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, and Sheila Blair, Former Chair of the FDIC, took to Twitter to debate failing banks and Too Big To Fail. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n---\nTwitter was a great place to get timely UK Election poll results and stay up to date on the latest in politics:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe British Pound moved sharply following unexpected election results:  \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThere was also substantial information on the future of British government that appeared quickly on Twitter:  \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n----\nThe biggest merger news of the month was Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquisition of Whole Foods. The Bloomberg Terminal was flooded with Tweets discussing the deal as shown in the accompanying chart:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n\u00c2\u00a0\nTwitter User to Watch\nWe wanted to highlight one user per blog post who is especially newsworthy, producing compelling content, or is brand new to the platform.\nWelcome to Twitter: Jeff Gundlach \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn May 2017, Jeff Gundlach, one of Bloomberg Markets 50 Most Influential People, burst onto the social media scene with a unique and unfiltered voice. Jeff spoke with Twitter about how he uses the platform and he stated \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I like about Twitter is that I can relay facts without an intermediary. We all remember the 'telephone' game in elementary school. Each link is a loss of true content.\"\nJeff also noted \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like that I can relay somewhat controversial messages that I strongly believe in but will not be covered in the mainstream media.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n________________________________________________________________________\nAs you can see, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s platform is used by elected officials, company executives, and financial professionals across the globe to communicate publicly in real-time. Tweets move markets, and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partners do an incredible job of identifying the best content, and integrating it directly into their clients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 workflow.\nOf course we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feature all of the great finance content from the month of June in this post alone, so we created a moment to share some of the other interesting finance Tweets that caught our eye. If you spot a market moving Tweet, and want us to feature it in a future blog post, Tweet to us using the hashtag #TweetsOfTheMonth.\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@Twitter\n#OnlyOnTwitter\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTags:\nmoney\nguest posts\ndata\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

The spread of terrorism and violent extremism is a pressing global problem and a critical challenge for us all. We take these issues very seriously, and each of our companies have developed policies and removal practices that enable us to take a hard line against terrorist or violent extremist content on our hosted consumer services. We believe that by working together, sharing the best technological and operational elements of our individual efforts, we can have a greater impact on the threat of terrorist content online.  The new forum builds on initiatives including the EU Internet Forum and the Shared Industry Hash Database; discussions with the UK government; and the conclusions of the recent G7 and European Council meetings. \u00c2\u00a0It will formalise and structure existing and future areas of collaboration between our companies and foster cooperation with smaller tech companies, civil society groups and academics, governments and supra-national bodies such as the EU and the UN.  The scope of our work will evolve over time as we will need to be responsive to the ever-evolving terrorist and extremist tactics. Initially, however, our work will focus on: \u00c2\u00a0\nTechnological solutions: our companies will work together to refine and improve existing joint technical work, such as the Shared Industry Hash Database; exchange best practices as we develop and implement new content detection and classification techniques using machine learning; and define standard transparency reporting methods for terrorist content removals.\nResearch: we will commission research to inform our counter-speech efforts and guide future technical and policy decisions around the removal of terrorist content.\nKnowledge-sharing: we will work with counter-terrorism experts including governments, civil society groups, academics and other companies to engage in shared learning about terrorism. And through a joint partnership with the UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Executive Directorate (UN CTED) and the ICT4Peace Initiative, we are establishing a broad knowledge-sharing network to:\nEngage with smaller companies: we will help them develop the technology and processes necessary to tackle terrorist and extremist content online.\nDevelop best practices: we already partner with organizations such as the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Anti-Defamation League and Global Network Initiative to identify how best to counter extremism and online hate, while respecting freedom of expression and privacy. We can socialise these best practices, and develop additional shared learnings on topics such as community guideline development, and policy enforcement.\nCounterspeech: each of us already has robust counterspeech initiatives in place (e.g., YouTube\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Creators for Change, Jigsaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Redirect method, Facebook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s P2P and OCCI, Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partnership with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue for counter-narratives on Bing, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global NGO training programme). The forum we have established allows us to learn from and contribute to one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s counterspeech efforts, and discuss how to further empower and train civil society organisations and individuals who may be engaged in similar work and support ongoing efforts such as the Civil society empowerment project (CSEP).\nWe will be hosting a series of learning workshops in partnership with UN CTED/ICT4Peace in Silicon Valley and around the world to drive these areas of collaboration.\nFurther information on all of the above initiatives will be shared in due course.\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\nsafety\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nOur #DataForGood partnership with New Zealand's NCPACS\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 11 March 2020\n          \nCoronavirus: Staying safe and informed on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 12 January 2021\n          \nServing the public conversation during #KoreanElection2020 amid COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 27 April 2020\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

Since the Council was established in February 2016, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had ongoing conversations on our products, policies and programs with our members. In particular, they provided us with invaluable feedback as we launched new policies and features, and refocused our efforts on leveraging our technology to improve safety on Twitter.

She also shared her views on the power of empathy and counter-speech online, and even how she found her husband on Twitter. Megan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s humble articulation of why it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vital to see every side is deeply compelling and it's a perspective that informs everything we do as a company.

We started by speaking with the people who love Twitter and use it every day, and we emerged with something that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t new but rather what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always been.\nTwitter is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening and what people are talking about all over the world. We rolled out our new expression digitally, across all our channels and beyond. Those new to Twitter started to understand what Twitter is for, our customers told us we felt more \u00e2\u0080\u009cTwittery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and our brand partners are excited about their opportunity to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOur identity and role in the world today is more relevant than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been and we wanted to go a step further. We asked our most passionate customers what they love most about Twitter, what makes Twitter special for them.\nWhat they said was powerful: Twitter lets me see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening from every point of view, all perspectives, every side. Whether it be music, sports, news or entertainment, being able to see every side of a topic, makes Twitter unlike any other platform or service in the world.\nOur new campaign aims to capture that very sentiment as we kick off on TV tonight with @chancetherapper. Chance\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authentic use of Twitter is powerful as is his fandom and the conversation that surrounds him. We spotlight the voices of fans, press, influencers and artists - every side of the conversation - at the speed of Twitter.\nhttps://twitter.com/Twitter/status/876758738975195136 \nIn the next few weeks, we will also be launching films showing every side of sports and news.\nhttps://twitter.com/Twitter/status/876730182744387584\nhttps://twitter.com/Twitter/status/876729877772238848\nThis week, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also launching our brand story in Japan through a TV campaign that contextualizes \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the power of seeing multiple perspectives from the 40 million who use Twitter in Japan.\nhttps://twitter.com/TwitterJP/status/876554586051330048 \nOver the coming weeks and months we'll continue to tell our story and the stories of people all over the world who are on Twitter, from every side.

For example, people thought the reply icon, an arrow, meant delete or go back to a previous page. We switched to a speech bubble, a symbol most know and love. We also made the icons lighter for more seamless interaction.\nTweets now update instantly with reply, Retweet, and like counts so you can see conversations as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happening \u00e2\u0080\u0093 live.**\nAlso, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see additional accessibility choices such as increased color contrast and the option to always open supported links in Safari Reader view.*\nAs always, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to listen to your feedback and we have more design updates coming soon.

As such, we care deeply about the issue of misinformation and its potentially harmful effect on the civic and political discourse that is core to our mission.  Fake news has become a catchphrase used to describe everything from manufactured news stories, incorrect information and state-supported propaganda, to news some people don't like or points of view with which people disagree.  Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s open and real-time nature is a powerful antidote to the spreading of all types of false information. This is important because we cannot distinguish whether every single Tweet from every person is truthful or not. We, as a company, should not be the arbiter of truth. Journalists, experts and engaged citizens Tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds. These vital interactions happen on Twitter every day, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to ensure we are surfacing the highest quality and most relevant content and context first.  Bots  While bots can be a positive and vital tool, from customer support to public safety, we strictly prohibit the use of bots and other networks of manipulation to undermine the core functionality of our service. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doubling down on our efforts here, expanding our team and resources, and building new tools and processes. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to iterate, learn, and make improvements on a rolling basis to ensure our tech is effective in the face of new challenges.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working hard to detect spammy behaviors at source, such as the mass distribution of Tweets or attempts to manipulate trending topics. We also reduce the visibility of potentially spammy Tweets or accounts while we investigate whether a policy violation has occurred. When we do detect duplicative, or suspicious activity, we suspend accounts. We also frequently take action against applications that abuse the public API to automate activity on Twitter, stopping potentially manipulative bots at the source.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth noting that in order to respond to this challenge efficiently and to ensure people cannot circumvent these safeguards, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unable to share the details of these internal signals in our public API. While this means research conducted by third parties about the impact of bots on Twitter is often inaccurate and methodologically flawed, we must protect the future effectiveness of our work.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re committed to doing our part and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to share updates along the way.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\npolicy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

Now, businesses can attach buttons to messages to make it easy for people to take actions outside of the Direct Message conversation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 like composing a Tweet, following an account, or opening a website within the Twitter app.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nFor many businesses, delivering a great customer experience through a bot in Direct Messages depends on helping people complete a task other than sending a message. These tasks can include:\nTweeting about your bot: At the right point in the conversation, people might want to Tweet to share a coupon or offer, challenge their followers to a game, or tell the world about new content they just discovered -- like a new product or an exclusive movie clip. The unique combination of public and private messaging on Twitter makes it easy for people to become brand advocates by Tweeting about an experience. And by combining this feature with the new Direct Message Card, those Tweets can then help other users discover and start talking to your bot.\nVisiting a website: After discovering content or making a choice in a Direct Message, people might need to visit a website (e.g., a payment page to complete a transaction). Buttons that point to web links open a native browser within the Twitter app, so that once a person completes an action, they can come right back into the Direct Message to continue the conversation.\nFollowing accounts: With the ability to turn on the setting for \u00e2\u0080\u0098Receive Direct Messages from anyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099 not everyone who engages with your bot necessarily follows your account. Buttons let you direct people to your profile page to follow your account, and encourage people who engage with your bot to then follow your Tweets.\nStarting a conversation with a different account you own: Some businesses use multiple accounts on Twitter for different purposes, and at times it makes sense to ask a user to send a Direct Message to another account. For instance, a brand might run a marketing-related bot in Direct Messages in one account but provide customer service through another account. Now a button can be used to seamlessly guide users into a new conversation.\nUp to three buttons can be attached to any message and they can be used to open any web URL, including links to other features in the Twitter app. Businesses can fully customize the call-to-action text on a button, including the use of emojis.\nBusinesses are already getting creative with how these buttons are used. For example, Focus Features has a bot that showcases trailers for their upcoming movies, lets people buy movie tickets, enables people to join their rewards program, and even connects people to a human to answer questions. For their new movie The Beguiled, the bot has additional features where people can play a trivia game to get more excited about the release. After completing a quiz, people are encouraged to share their score and invite their followers to engage with the bot as well.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter provides a unique and powerful platform for us to directly engage with our core audience and we're excited about the ability to turn that audience into an organic source of discovery for our bot. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to partner with Massively in the development and launch of our Focus Features Bot.\nJoshua Kornblit\nSVP Digital Marketing, Focus Features\nSTXfilms has created a unique bot for the upcoming sci-fi action adventure, Luc Besson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. The bot enables people to engage in a conversation with characters from the movie, and even go through training to join Valerian and Laureline in the fight to save Alpha. Once people get far enough into the storyline, they get a message with a button attached that lets them know they can unlock exclusive content if they share the bot with their followers through a Tweet. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n            Your browser does not support the <code>video</code> element.\n        \nPlay\nPlay\nPause\nSeek\n0% buffered\n          \n00:00\nCurrent time\n00:00\nDuration\n00:00\nToggle Mute\nVolume\nMovies are discovered on Twitter in real time. People watch the trailer, Tweet their thoughts, read the reactions of others, and engage with the movie, cast and crew directly. We're excited to extend the Valerian experience on Twitter with a rich and engaging Direct Message bot. The new ability to get people to share the experience with their followers allows for more engagement, excitement, and conversation about Valerian.\nRamzy Zeidan\nVP, Digital Marketing, STXfilms\nButtons on messages will begin rolling out today and will soon be visible across our iOS, Android and desktop web clients. Alongside Direct Message Cards, welcome messages, quick replies, custom profiles, location sharing and Customer Feedback Cards, this feature adds to the canvas available for businesses to create innovative customer experiences in Twitter Direct Messages. Like these other features, it is only supported via our developer API.

Since it's founding over 11 years ago, the platform has always been a candid snapshot of what the entire world is thinking about on any topic, at any point in time. With users across the globe sending out billions of Tweets every week, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to imagine how that information can be aggregated and analyzed to better understand consumer preferences, and how those opinions expressed through Tweets can offer insights related to future company performance. In our last blog post, we highlighted how Bloomberg identifies Tweets from across the globe to help their users stay ahead of major market-moving events.\nIn this post, we wanted to invite LikeFolio (@LikeFolio) to share some of the innovative work they are doing to help uncover deep insights related to consumer behaviors on Twitter. \u00c2\u00a0 \u00c2\u00a0\nBy creating a highly structured product and brand map, LikeFolio is able to aggregate consumer conversations on Twitter related to specific companies and their products. As companies release new goods and services, Twitter users share their thoughts, opinions and reactions in real time. That data is then compiled and analyzed to predict how successful those offerings will be, and how those predictions confirm or contradict Wall Street expectations. Looking at the results over time, LikeFolio has been able to help investors detect shifts in consumer behavior well before the market has factored them into the stock price.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to let Andy Swan (@AndySwan), co-founder of LikeFolio, tell you about some of the interesting insights they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve observed over the past few months:\n__________________________________________________________________ \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter has always been a place where interesting and diverse conversations happen. While some users discuss news stories or current events, other users talk about their daily personal lives. Those conversations can range from excitement about upcoming product launches, to experiences while riding on an airplane. LikeFolio looks to sift through that information, to understand how customers are engaging with brands, and how that can change over time. Let me show you what I mean. \nWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the (social media) beef?\nThe restaurant chain Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s has rewritten the book on social media in 2017, going on the offensive when it comes to their food offerings relative to the competition, including\u00e2\u0080\u00a6  Those that question their commitment to quality\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs well as their competitors\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTheir customers are liking it, engaging with the company at impressive rates, and even racking up world-record numbers of Retweets in exchange for delicious chicken nuggets.  But has this massive social buzz moved the needle for Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in terms of how consumers see the brand?  For this, we reference LikeFolio\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Consumer Happiness Score for the company. \u00c2\u00a0This score is determined by looking at the Tweets mentioning Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and its proprietary brands/products and determining if the person authoring the Tweet was speaking positively or negatively about the company. \u00c2\u00a0  This sentiment data is expressed as a percent positive score from 0-100 as calculated using the following equation: \u00c2\u00a0(# of positive Tweets)/(# positive Tweets + # of negative Tweets). \u00c2\u00a0Note that neutral Tweets are not considered in this metric.  The higher the score, the more positive Tweeters are about the brand/product/cashtag. \u00c2\u00a0  Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consumer happiness level has looked like over the past six months:\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs you can see from the graph above, Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saw a huge increase in overall mentions near the beginning of the year (green and red bars). \u00c2\u00a0But even as mention volume spiked, the percentage of those Tweets that were positive in nature (purple line) also grew. \u00c2\u00a0This 1-2 punch of increased mention volume and higher Consumer Happiness Score is usually a very positive sign for a company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future growth.  This mention boom has clearly been good for their social metrics\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but has it translated into an increase in customers ringing the cash register?  To answer, we looked into purchase intent mentions\u00c2\u00a0about Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on Twitter, and compared it to McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as a baseline.\u00c2\u00a0 Instead of just looking at the volume of conversation, we focused exclusively on Tweets that strongly indicate a user is actually buying food from the restaurant\u00c2\u00a0at that moment.  The results were fascinating\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs you can see, the Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to Twitter started paying dividends at the start of the year.  The spike in January is impressive, but what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really impressive is how the purchase intent metrics for Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually stabilized at a higher baseline than they ever reached in 2016, closing the gap with their biggest rival McDonald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe to say Wendy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s has a new approach to marketing, and their fans are really liking it.\n___________________________________________________________________ \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAs you can see, Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s developer ecosystem has built a wide variety of innovative solutions for investment community.

This \u00e2\u0080\u009cunwritten rule\u00e2\u0080\u009d is that if you mention that a pitcher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hurling a no-hitter, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to fruition. This is often practiced by teammates in the dugout, fans in the stadium, broadcasters covering the game from the stadium, and of course by fans on Twitter. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe decided to get to the bottom of this longtime legend. If you see a no-hitter in progress this year, are you free to talk (or Tweet!) about it, or are you going to be the jinx? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s take a look at the data to find out.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not quite a feasible way to measure how much conversation there is out in the world about a (potential) no-hitter, but Twitter data serves as a great proxy in this case. And since - to some! - the folklore allows for creative turns of phrase (\u00e2\u0080\u009cno runners have reached base other than a walk\u00e2\u0080\u009d), just not the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cno hitter\u00e2\u0080\u009d, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a simple way to query the conversation by looking for the number of Tweets that use that particular phrasing (along with a few hashtagged versions & alternate spellings). We want to explore the relationship between the number of Tweets mentioning a no-hitter in progress, and whether the no-hitter was successfully completed.\nTo dig into the jinx theory, we focused on the 2015 season, which had 34 no-hit bids (defined for this research as no hits through six complete innings) and seven completed no-hitters, giving us more games to base the analysis on than last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s season with just one no-hitter or the one so far this season. (Thank you to Baseball Reference @Baseball_Ref for compiling game data.)\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLooking at volume level from the entire game time will include Tweets that either celebrate a successful no-hitter or react to it getting broken up. To remove those surges and to standardize the time period for each game, we opted to focus on the amount of Tweets in approximately the first seven innings of the game. We measured the number of no-hitter Tweets from start-of-game through 40 minutes before final pitch for a broken-up no-hitter (in 2015, the average MLB game was around 3 hours, which means that each inning lasts approx. 20 minutes) and 32 minutes for a completed no-hitter (average no-hitter game time was 2:31).\nHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what the pace of conversation looks like for a no-hitter compared to one that got broken up, focusing on two of @Max_Scherzer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outings (he also had an additional no-hitter *and* an additional no-hit bid that season):\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNow it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to zero in on the potential jinx. First, we checked how many Tweets mention \u00e2\u0080\u009cno hitter\u00e2\u0080\u009d on an average in-season day in 2015 (excluding days that saw a no-hitter or bid): around 700. Games that had a no-hitter into the 7th, but did not end as a no-hitter, saw around 2,500 Tweets in the -30min window. And no-hitters? Those had over 5,000 Tweets in the -32min window. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nSo what does that tell us? There are more than twice as many Tweets saying the specific phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009cno-hitter\u00e2\u0080\u009d in (approximately) the first 6 innings for games that are indeed successful no-hitters than there are in games that fail to see it through. In other words: based on Twitter data, talking about a no-hitter does not jinx it. (But we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go so far as to suggest a new superstition that you have to Tweet about a no-hitter in order to make it happen\u00e2\u0080\u00a6)\nNext time you see a no-hitter in progress (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be crossing my fingers that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from my @SFGiants), feel free to Tweet about it!

The NeighborNest was created with the intention of people coming together based on a shared love of learning and technology. Two years on, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraged by how our mission has come to life and excited for the journey ahead.\nWe listened closely to the community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s needs to ensure we could best fulfill this purpose, leveraging Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in technology and our partners\u00e2\u0080\u0099 expertise in social services. Since its doors opened in 2015, we have hosted more than 7,000 visits and provided more than 2,000 hours of programming, \u00c2\u00a0including coding classes, social media training for nonprofits, a citizenship and media literacy curriculum.\nWe marked this milestone by celebrating our #NestFest on Twitter, taking advantage of what the platform does best -- bringing everyone near and far together for a shared purpose. We also had an intimate celebration with families from the community and volunteers over a movie, pizza, and cake.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nLearn\nAn important aspect of our approach is meeting people where they are, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done this in various ways: working with adults intimidated by attending classes, welcoming volunteers who want to share their love for coding but aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used to being around kids, and training nonprofits who want to share their work, but have limited knowledge of Twitter. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\nThrough the digital literacy programs we offer at the NeighborNest, we are helping adult learners with little or no prior exposure to computers achieve IT proficiency, which can in turn improve their employment prospects. Our Twitter volunteers have led a Coding for Kids and Digital Citizenship program, which reinforces the importance of early education for youth and families. Additionally, the NeighborNest hosts Twitter for Nonprofits, helping partners leverage Twitter to advance their mission.\nThe NeighborNest serves as a window for Twitter volunteers to see and experience the community\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history, and the resilience of its residents in the face of everyday adversity. More importantly, perhaps, it has shown us what a big a difference little things can make: a welcoming space, healthy snacks, time invested, and hands-on assistance.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI enjoy coming to the Nest because there are always computers open...I can make myself a cup of coffee or grab a water bottle. If my daughter is with me and I need to focus on something, the staff is able to watch after her. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find that kind of support anywhere else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Andrea, client\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking at the NeighborNest has reinforced just how big of an impact we can make by donating our time, and you don't need a background in computers to help someone uplevel their technology skills.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Greg, volunteer\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nConnect\nThe NeighborNest has emerged as a collaborative, diverse, and commonly frequented space for Twitter employees and members of the community. Visitors and volunteers come to the NeighborNest for skills-based training, family-oriented programs, and various activities, but often end up creating connections and fostering a support system amongst clients and volunteers.\nWhile families from different programs get to know each other, share community resources, and forge new friendships, nonprofit staff members meet new people, learn about each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work, and exchange best practices. Volunteers tell us that the NeighborNest has enabled them to feel more connected to both their community and their colleagues.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPersonally, I get a lot of joy helping out the nonprofits and also make great connections!\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Betty, volunteer\n\u00c2\u00a0\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nGrow\nThe growth experienced at the NeighborNest has surpassed simply learning new information and skills. As a result of our workshops, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a notable increase in people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confidence, their eagerness to take on new tasks, and they approach job interviews with their head held a little higher.\nAfter regular visits to the NeighborNest, children who used to cling to their parents now immediately run into the play area and have developed critical social skills that have helped them become more pre-school ready. These kids have become more independent as a result of time spent at the childcare area while their parents attend class in the next room.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time at the Nest has been well spent. Our self-esteem has been elevated through excellent programs on housing, computer classes and one on one personal help. I believe our daughter, when she grows up, will always have fond memories of this beautiful place called NeighborNest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Dave, client\nTwitter employees have also expressed personal and professional growth as a result of volunteering. Exposure to a thriving community and the chance to interact with the people and organizations that make this part of San Francisco so unique - this is a vital part of our company philosophy. Twitter for Nonprofits workshop volunteers have come to understand our services better, how organizations are using them, and ways to equip nonprofits in leveraging product features to better amplify their mission-driven work.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt helps me take a step back and see the larger picture. This subsequently motivates me to work harder at Twitter. It also makes me very grateful that Twitter cares about the community and the neighborhood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d - Twitter volunteer\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEveryday, the NeighborNest harnesses the power of people coming together \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the idea that actions are more impactful with the support of others, and goals less daunting. This approach has helped shape our purpose and our path has unfolded organically. We continue to listen to our community and employees and do our best to meet their needs. We lean on respective experts to evaluate our efforts and we adjust as needed. Through this process, we not only build digital literacy skills, but also awareness, empathy, and profound connections.\nHappy birthday, NeighborNest! \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOnly on Twitter\n@TwitterForGood\n@NeighborNest\n#TwitterForGood\n#NestFest\nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nTwitter NeighborNest\nTwitter for Good\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\n#SaferInternetDay 2020: Creating a better internet for all\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 February 2020\n          \n#TwitterForGood Day\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 12 May 2017\n          \nHow the @Chiefs #SuperBowl victory played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 3 February 2020\n          \n#KpopTwitter rises to the top with 6.1 billion global Tweets in 2019\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 17 January 2020\n          "}

Increasingly, businesses are using Direct Messages to create rich, personalized interactions that deepen relationships with consumers, ranging from customer acquisition to fun, engaging bots such as the first ever March Madness bracket builder in Direct Messages (#WendysBracket). This new card will help businesses drive discovery of such experiences both through Promoted Tweets and organic sharing.\nUsing a Direct Message Card, businesses can capture people's attention with engaging image or video creatives, and include up to four fully customizable call-to-action buttons. Each call-to-action button takes the user into a specific experience within Direct Messages. With Direct Message Cards running in Promoted Tweet campaigns, businesses can take advantage of Twitter Ads' full targeting suite to find a relevant audience to pull into personalized conversations at scale. Businesses can also turn their audience into advocates by encouraging them to share the experience in their own voice through a Tweet.\nSeveral brands around the world are launching Promoted Tweet campaigns using the Direct Message Card this week to drive discovery of the experiences they have built.

While there are countless ways in which they have innovated using Twitter Data over the past 10 years, we thought it would be helpful to hear from some of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most trusted finance partners directly.\nThis will be the first of what will become an ongoing series of guest blog posts. Our goal is twofold: first, we want to continue to surface great insights and some of the best, most compelling content on Twitter. The second is to showcase all the great work and diverse perspectives our partners are bringing to Twitter and the value gained by financial professionals.\nOne organization Twitter works very closely with is Bloomberg, which has done incredible work bringing the power of Twitter Data directly onto the Bloomberg Terminal and who we just partnered with to launch a new global live video breaking news network exclusively on Twitter. Bloomberg (@TheTerminal) leverages Twitter Data at scale to help quantify market trends, calculate investor sentiment on an individual company level, and inform their users of breaking business news & current events as they unfold on Twitter. All of this helps Bloomberg Terminal subscribers generate ideas and maintain comprehensive access to real-time information on global markets within one fully integrated market data solution.\nThis first guest blog post in our series features Mark Dimont (@mdimont), Product Manager for Bloomberg Terminal News Applications (@TheTerminal), who will walk us through some of the most financially relevant Tweets over the month of April.\nWe hope you enjoy, and be sure to look for additional partners and guest bloggers in the coming months. And now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn it over to Mark:\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094\nAt Bloomberg, I send a recurring note to my colleagues called \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis Week in Social.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The email aggregates items from financial social media that are particularly popular, novel, interesting or compelling. For this blog collaboration with Twitter I have compiled some of the best content from these notes for the full month of April.\n \nTweets of the Month: CEOs, Short-Sellers, and Journalists talk stocks and move markets\nThese \u00e2\u0080\u009cTweets of the Month\u00e2\u0080\u009d represent a collection of the most popular, compelling, and impactful Tweets for the month of April in the finance world. Some of these may have made national news, while others might have flown completely under the radar of mainstream media. We saw some great content this month in terms of Tweets that had a material impact both on the markets as well as mindshare of the financial community at large.\nElon Musk responds to short-sellers following Tesla record results: One of the pre-eminent and most active executives we see on Twitter is Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla, Solarcity, and SpaceX). He is informal, blunt and not afraid to talk stocks. After Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings this month, he responded to short sellers in Tesla as the stock climbed.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nStock moves related to Tweets about Westar Energy and Great Plains Energy merger: Twitter is a powerful outlet for regional news and reporters, and is frequently the source for breaking market moving content. In this case a local Kansas reporter covering a court case impacting the merger of Westar Energy and Great Plains Energy tweeted the following directly from the courtroom. Shortly thereafter Westar Energy dropped 4.5% post-market, and the following day it fell as much as 7.7% on the New York Stock Exchange \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nShort Sellers Opinions have Impact on Stocks: Earlier this month, short-seller Marc Cohodes tweeted his view of Equitable Group and helped to propel its stock price substantially lower. The opinions of short-sellers in social media can dramatically impact stock prices and at times be predictive of very large moves in security prices. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nRichmond Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lacker announces immediate departure:  The actions of the US Federal Reserve Bank are watched closely on Wall Street and when this news of the abrupt resignation of the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond broke on Twitter, it quickly got the attention of investors around the world \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as his votes as a member of the FOMC impacted interest rates and US monetary policy. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Finance Around the World: Government Ministers use Twitter as a way to reach their Constituents\nCompelling and relevant content for the finance world is not just confined to domestic issues. The global nature of finance lends itself to comment from the myriad of world leaders and CEO\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on Twitter. This month is no exception with important Tweets on everything from the French election to the Foreign Minister of Iran.\nThere was a flurry of interesting content in April around the French Election: The French Election was broadly watched by Wall Street and social media proved an excellent source for differentiated content. Poll results appeared rapidly (and often first) on social media, and even the candidates themselves were taking to Twitter throughout the election. Leading candidate, Emmanuel Macron, used the platform to reach his supporters and give his thanks and encouragement.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n (TRANSLATION: Blairo Maggi: I have good news!

Over the last four years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve brought users video content around the things they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already discussing on the platform, working with the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top TV networks, sports leagues, publishing houses & magazines, and professional news outlets. In 2016, we started building on this to bring live streaming video to Twitter to create a one-screen experience for great live content and the conversation around it. Brands align with all of this content to reach engaged audiences at scale.\nOur live video and Amplify business now work hand-in-hand as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown our premium video business to more than 200 premium video publishers across the most active segments on Twitter \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from sports and esports, to news, creators and entertainment.

What you may not know is that video impressions on Twitter grew significantly from Q3 to Q4 2016 as Twitter is fast becoming the place for people to tune in and watch what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re rolling out In-Stream Video Ads and sharing new research that shows Twitter video ads help marketers reach their audience and drive powerful results.\nIn-Stream Video Ads help marketers tell their story\nTwitter is home to brand-safe video from hundreds of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top publishers. That means brands can now run In-Stream Video Ads to align with videos \u00e2\u0080\u0094 highlights clips and live-streams \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from Amplify partners, including top TV networks, major sports leagues, major publishing houses and magazines, and professional news outlets. This includes pre-roll and mid-roll ads.\nIn recent experiments, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been automatically promoting videos with high engagement from select publishers. Not only does this drive more views for the publisher, it also allows advertisers to get their message in front of a larger target audience. We have seen early success in the US and look forward to rolling this out more widely in the year ahead.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nNew research on the effectiveness of video ads\nTime and again Twitter video ad campaigns drive positive shifts in key brand metrics for advertisers. Across 406 Nielsen Brand Effect studies, those who saw video ads on Twitter were 50% more likely to be aware of the advertiser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand, feel 14% more favorable about the brand, and had 18% higher purchase intent (versus those not exposed to video ads).\nWhy? People come to Twitter in a discovery mindset, making them more attentive, responsive, and trusting of the video ad content they see on Twitter in comparison to competing platforms. This leads to video ads on Twitter being almost 2X as memorable when compared to the same ads on other premium sites.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHelping marketers measure their impact\nAs we shared last week, we are helping marketers measure the impact of their video campaigns by continuing to invest in measurement. This includes relationships with industry-leading third-party measurement providers to understand whether video ads they run on Twitter are viewable and were delivered to the audience they intended to reach.\nInvesting in the video experience\nAs a company, we are making video experiences even better for consumers, publishers, and advertisers. We are investing in the video viewing experience through updates to our platform, content development, and video ad solutions.\nWe are poised to continue telling this story to the industry on May 1, 2017, at the Digital Content NewFronts in New York, where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll share more about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video content partners and long-term plans.\nGet Started\nTo learn more about our video ad solutions, reach out to your Twitter account representative.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nbest practices\nresearch\nvideo\nmarketing\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Events\nGive it up for the winners of the first annual #TwitterAwards\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 11 November 2016\n          \n#SaferInternetDay 2020: Creating a better internet for all\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 11 February 2020\n          \nHow the @Chiefs #SuperBowl victory played out on Twitter\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 3 February 2020\n          \n#KpopTwitter rises to the top with 6.1 billion global Tweets in 2019\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 17 January 2020\n          "}

Now, via Custom Hearts, Periscope hearts can be tailored to a brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s campaign, opening up an organic way for branded content to be present throughout a live experience. Custom Hearts are present throughout the entire video and are sent by the audience by tapping the screen, giving brands an opportunity to capture a high number of engagements and allowing people to express their enthusiasm for the content while amplifying the brand\u00e2\u0080\u0099s message.\nHow it Works Custom Hearts provide brands an opportunity to add more branding to their Periscope Broadcasts through custom graphics that display natively amongst standard Periscope hearts and are activated through a specific hashtag in the broadcast\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title. Once activated, the Custom Heart design is then natively mixed in with the standard hearts.

However, there are several barriers to using Twitter, including slow mobile networks, expensive data plans, or lack of storage on mobile devices. While smartphone adoption grew to 3.8 billion connections by the end of 2016, 45% of mobile connections are still on slower 2G networks, according to GSMA.\nToday, we are rolling out Twitter Lite, a new mobile web experience which minimizes data usage, loads quickly on slower connections, is resilient on unreliable mobile networks, and takes up less than 1MB on your device. We also optimized it for speed, with up to 30% faster launch times as well as quicker navigation throughout Twitter. Twitter Lite provides the key features of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0094your timeline, Tweets, Direct Messages, trends, profiles, media uploads, notifications, and more.

In this mode, you will see a preview of images and videos before choosing which ones to fully load. This can reduce your data usage by up to 70%, making it more affordable for you to use Twitter in areas where mobile data is expensive. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTwitter Lite has additional features in Google Chrome and other modern browsers on Android devices.

A more in-depth look at how we built Twitter Lite can be found here.\nTwitter Lite is a great way for many people in emerging markets across Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa to experience Twitter for the first time on their mobile devices. Today in India, we have partnered with Vodafone, one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest telecom operators with over 200 million subscribers, to promote Twitter Lite to their customers as a way to get live sports updates on Indian Premier League matches, teams, and players as the cricket season kicks off.

This was a playful way to reference how eggs hatch into birds that send all the Tweets you see on Twitter! But now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time for something new \u00e2\u0080\u0093 something that encourages people to upload their own photos for more personal expression. So today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing a new default profile photo.\nThere are a few reasons why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing this:\nLast year we refreshed our brand, with a new look and feel highlighting the diversity and expressiveness of the people around the world who make up the Twitter community, in all its color and vibrancy. As part of our work to bring these ideas into the product, we realized it was time to change the default profile photo, to help prompt more self-expression.\nWe noticed that some people kept the egg default profile photo because they thought it was fun and cute, but we want people to use this space to show us who they are! The new default image feels more like an empty state or placeholder, and we hope it encourages people to upload images that express themselves.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve noticed patterns of behavior with accounts that are created only to harass others \u00e2\u0080\u0093 often they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take the time to personalize their accounts. This has created an association between the default egg profile photo and negative behavior, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair to people who are still new to Twitter and haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yet personalized their profile photo.\nHow We Did It Our first step was to look back at all of Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s default profile photos throughout the years. We originally chose the egg, with a different colored background for each new account, because we wanted something that was playful, fun, and unique.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Twitter default profile photo, through the years\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nFor the new default profile photo, we decided that we wanted to use people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing expectations for default profile photos and how they serve as a temporary placeholder. From this process, we identified a set of traits the new default profile photo should have:\nGeneric\nUniversal\nSerious\nUnbranded\nTemporary\nInclusive\nWe went through many iterations to develop the new profile photo to make sure it displayed those traits. First, we explored gray, generic images to communicate that this profile photo is intended to be temporary. We looked at figures, photos, and patterns. For the figures, we thought about combinations of very common, circular shapes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 these were a good starting point because they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any notable physical attributes. Because photos are usually communicated with a landscape icon, we felt that this was also a good route to explore. We additionally considered a simple, line-based pattern to try something without a figure.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAfter deciding on a figure, we began our refinements. We had to determine how to bring inclusivity into our single default profile photo, given that we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require people to specify their gender on Twitter. We felt that the circle of the head in the figure still seemed masculine, even though it technically had no design characteristics to indicate that it was a man. So for inspiration, we looked at how women are portrayed in generic, wayfinding iconography, such as bathroom signs, and noticed that the only difference between the sexes is the shape of their clothing. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Bathroom sign iconography\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nRegardless, people have come to associate the circle head with masculinity, and because of this association, we felt that it was important to explore alternate head shapes. We reviewed many variations of our figure, altering both the head and shoulders to feel more inclusive to all genders. When the shoulders were wider, the image felt overly masculine, so we decreased the width of the shoulders and adjusted the height of the figure. As a result of these iterations, we ended with a more gender-balanced figure. We chose grays because they feel temporary, generic, and universal. With that, we included a higher contrast color combination to make this image accessible for those with visual impairments. Because of its coloring, the new profile photo also gives less prominence to accounts with a default profile photo.\n \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          \n            Progression from our initial to final figure\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \n          \n            New default profile photo\u00a0\n          \n          \n        \nWe hope this new default profile photo encourages more people to express themselves on Twitter!

Today, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing a new opportunity for publishers and creators to monetize their content, and for brands to advertise against it, with pre-roll ads on Periscope video within Twitter. \nHow It Works Pre-roll ads on Periscope video enable brands to marry their message with specific broadcasts from creators and publishers. The same control that brands have to design their campaigns through the Amplify program will be extended to the new opportunities created with these ads. The experience will mirror how ads currently appear on all Twitter video: when consumers scroll through their timelines or search for content from a specific publishers or creators, Periscope videos - live and replay - can start with a short ad.\nAds on Periscope videos are a new way to use live and on-demand video to reach audiences at the most relevant moments. Periscope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authentic and interactive nature brings people immediately into compelling live experiences and the conversation that surrounds them. From 360 degree and professionally-produced broadcasts to spontaneous mobile live video, stories can be shared through a range of video content.\nFor creators and publishers that use Periscope to go live on Twitter every day, these pre-roll ads present a new way to monetize their video content. For marketers, they have a new source of brand-safe video advertising beyond what was previously available, including ads during live streaming programs from select premium publishers, Promoted Tweets with Periscope video and custom Amplify campaigns with premium content creators.\nGet Started Ads on Periscope videos are now available to select advertisers through custom Amplify packages, and will roll out more broadly in the coming months.

{"date": "Tuesday, 21 March 2017", "title": "Our tenth Twitter #Transparency Report", "topic": "Company", "author": "Jeremy Kessel", "path": "https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2017/our-tenth-twitter-transparency-report", "post_text": "Company\nOur tenth Twitter #Transparency Report\n            By\n            \n  \n  \nTuesday, 21 March 2017\nLink copied successfully\nToday, we are publishing our latest Twitter Transparency Report with updated data covering the latter half of 2016. This is also our tenth report, a milestone that seemed a long way off when we announced our first report back in July 2012. A lot has changed over the past five years, both at Twitter and around the world. But the need for transparency into government and company actions has never been more important given the current climate of continued crackdowns on freedom of expression and limitations on citizens rights around the globe. On the positive side, it has been encouraging to see transparency reports become a mainstay of the technology industry, with more than 60 reports now in existence. This backdrop continues to inspire us to provide more meaningful data and insights into requests we receive that impact our users worldwide.\nOne area we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to introduce into our report going forward is a new section in the US report covering national security requests. As recently noted, we were able to reveal the existence of two national security letters after the FBI informed us that the gag orders had been lifted. We also spoke about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempt to use the statutory means provided in the USA Freedom Act to seek more transparency into similar NSL requests. Shortly after that post, we received word that the DOJ and FBI responded to our USA Freedom Act notices regarding three additional NSLs lifting the accompanying gag orders. Subsequently, we provided notice, including a copy of the data we produced, to the users affected by these requests. As we continue to push for more transparency in how we can speak about national security requests, we will update this new section in future transparency reports.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also adding a new section to our legal removals report covering requests to remove content from verified journalists and other media/news outlets. Given the concerning global trend of various governments cracking down on press freedom, we want to shine a brighter light on these requests. During this reporting period, Twitter received 88 legal requests from around the world directing us to remove content posted by verified journalists or news outlet accounts. We did not take any action on the majority of these requests, with limited exceptions in Germany and Turkey, the latter of which accounted for 88% of all requests of this nature. For example, we were compelled to withhold Tweets sharing graphic imagery following terror attacks in Turkey in response to a court order. More details about these requests are available in our report.\nBehind the scenes, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve begun the necessary work to include details about terms of service requests we receive from official government requesters through our standard customer support channels (as opposed to the data we already include based on legal requests). For now, we have added the new government terms of service section to this report with information covering government requests and our response to removing content that violates the Twitter Rules relating to the promotion of terrorism. It also includes an update on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued work to remove terrorist content from our platform beyond government reports.\nAlong with the new data and the latest reporting numbers for the second half of 2016, there are also a range of other updates across the report. For example, in our global information requests report, we now break out the number of emergency disclosure requests and preservation requests we receive by country. In our legal removals report, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve included more specificity around requests to remove Periscope and Vine content.

Twitter felt like the natural home for our journalistic initiatives and at the time was becoming increasingly popular in Turkey. We were impressed by the thoroughness of communication and possibility for meaningful interaction. I remember we would ask ourselves, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sending a Tweet to a minister and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to see it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d. From communicating with newly established accounts, to the president of the country, it felt liberating and gave us a tool to bypass the political bureaucracy in seconds. That was the captivating catalyst for us - real connection, real accountability.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we established @140journos.\nToday 520 out of 550 Turkish parliamentarians have active Twitter accounts. From Twitter diplomacy and domestic sports, to celebrities and trending topics, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a vital medium for understanding the social fabric of Turkey today. Tweets served as the primary vehicle for sharing live developments and information on the failed coup attempt last July. Tweets posted by @140journos were viewed 600 million times in 2016 alone. From day one, Twitter has been a true home for our important work.\nNow we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re collaborating with the brand we love.\nWith a format simply entitled #, 140journos has organized a series of educational workshops across Turkey with the support of Twitter. The workshop series is intended to teach university students about the basics of citizen journalism as well as online safety. Within the scope of #, 140journos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 editors visited universities in cities where there is interest in citizen journalism, as well as potential for greater Twitter usage.\nWe developed a custom curriculum, including: Turkey and social media usage; how to use Twitter 101, keeping up with the conversation in Turkey through Twitter; best-practice journalism on social media; public opinion formation; and keeping communication safe on Twitter.\nTo demonstrate how Twitter is a safe and fun place for all kinds of conversations, our number one priority during the tour has been demonstrating the various reporting functionalities. Along with features like mute and block, people have the tools to moderate and control their own experience on the platform. After sharing these presentations, the 140journos team organized workshops on how to join Twitter for those in attendance who did not yet have an account of their own.\nHours of presentations, hundreds of students, thousands of miles in order to create a platform for students to meet and interact with the iconic bald ibis puppet of 140journos and the legendary Twitter bird - it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been an amazing tour.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited for our continued partnership with our friends at Twitter. Whether you are conducting a journalistic project like us, or just sharing what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the moment, Twitter is where the world speaks.\nYou can read about Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest update on safety here.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\njournalism\npartnerships\npolicy\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Company\nUpdating our advertising policies on state media\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Monday, 19 August 2019\n          \nLeveraging the power of Twitter to combat the opioid crisis\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Tuesday, 23 April 2019\n          \n2018 US midterm elections review\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 31 January 2019\n          \nImperfect, by design\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Friday, 29 January 2021\n          "}

In honor of International Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day and Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s History Month, spotlight the women who inspire you with the hashtag #SheInspiresMe which will trigger a custom #WomensDay emoji. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWhile March 8th is the annual occasion of International Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day, we also wanted to look back on the powerful conversations about women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues that have taken place on Twitter all year long. In 2016, there were 25% more Tweets about \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeminism\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights\u00e2\u0080\u009d (and translations of those phrases in 10 languages) than in 2015 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and so far this year, the conversation has almost doubled from the same time period last year. These are the top days where mentions of \u00e2\u0080\u009cfeminism\u00e2\u0080\u009dhappened: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThroughout the year, activists and citizens have come to Twitter to discuss the issues facing women in their communities, countries, and industries. Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s participation and equality in the workforce has been one prominent conversation on Twitter this year: #DressLikeAWoman in the US (which drew over half a million Tweets in a few days), #WakingTheFeminist in Ireland, and #Planeta5050 in Brazil, were some of the hashtags tackling employment issues. The topic of #EqualPay was also an area of focus - there have been more than 2 million Tweets about it, with hashtags such as #gleichistmehr in Germany and #3\u00ec\u008b\u009cSTOP in Korea. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAnd in a year that saw the first female candidate to top a major Presidential ticket in the United States, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no surprise that issues around women in politics and important issues to female voters were popular discussion topics on Twitter, with conversations such as #NastyWoman in the US, #LabanLeni in the Philippines, #Ploumen4women in the Netherlands, and #BeraniPeduli in Indonesia. Women were also encouraged to speak out about political issues with hashtags including #CanYouHearUsNow (to draw attention to Muslim women in the United States), #BeraniPeduli (educating women about politics and fight for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s representation in politics), and #ElectWomen (supporting Irish women running for office). \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAnother powerful topic has been that of women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety and ability to freely occupy public spaces \u00e2\u0080\u0094 we saw conversations around this theme all across the globe. #ActionsMatter is a movement in Canada dedicated to eradicating violence against women by empowering citizens to take a stand. In the US, hashtags such as #StopTransMurders and #WeJustNeedToPee draw attention to trans issues and the threats of violence they regularly face, while others such as #WhyWomenDontReport provide a space for women to speak about sexual assault. In Italy, #potreiessereio and #\u00c3\u00a8oradichiederescusa have drawn awareness to violence against women; in India, #IWillGoOut advocated for women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety when walking alone; in Indonesia, #jtubuhkuotoritasku, a movement to celebrate and respect women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body without judgement. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nMillions of Tweets have also been sent with hashtags that are meant to shine a light on inspiring women and their accomplishments.

During the past few weeks alone, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made a number of changes on this front including updating how you can report abusive Tweets, stopping the creation of new abusive accounts, implementing safer search results, collapsing abusive or low-quality Tweets, and reducing notifications from conversations started by people you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve blocked or muted. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already seen an impact from these updates and we appreciate and value all of your feedback along the way. \nThis week we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re introducing additional updates that leverage our technology to reduce abusive content, give you more tools to control your experience, and communicate more clearly about actions we take.\nLeveraging our technology to reduce abusive content\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working to identify accounts as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re engaging in abusive behavior, even if this behavior hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been reported to us. Then, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking action by limiting certain account functionality for a set amount of time, such as allowing only their followers to see their Tweets. For example, this change could come into effect if an account is repeatedly Tweeting without solicitation at non-followers or engaging in patterns of abusive behavior that is in violation of the Twitter Rules. Our platform supports the freedom to share any viewpoint, but if an account continues to repeatedly violate the Twitter Rules, we will consider taking further action.\nWe aim to only act on accounts when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re confident, based on our algorithms, that their behavior is abusive. Since these tools are new we will sometimes make mistakes, but know that we are actively working to improve and iterate on them everyday.\nGiving you more control with additional tools\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also introducing new filtering options for your notifications to give you more control over what you see from certain types of accounts, like those without a profile photo, unverified email addresses or phone numbers. Many people requested more filter options for their notifications, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re excited to bring these to everyone on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also expanding the mute feature to build on the work we did in November which lets you remove certain keywords, phrases, or entire conversations from your notifications. Now, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to mute from your home timeline and you can decide how long this content is muted \u00e2\u0080\u0093 one day, one week, one month, or indefinitely.

You will be notified when we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve received your report and informed if we take further action.

Today, Twitter is launching a new feature \u00e2\u0080\u0093 custom profiles in Direct Messages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that allows businesses to better emphasize that human element in private conversations, as well as more clearly indicate when a bot is speaking. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nOur first partner to launch using this feature is T-Mobile, who has a long history of innovating to create great customer experiences on Twitter. Years ago, T-Mobile started using customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 real names and agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 initials in customer service-related Tweets. Last year, they started adding agents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 pictures and names to Tweet replies by linking to custom bio web pages for each agent. Now,@TMobileHelp is the first account to use custom profiles in Direct Messages, making private conversations more human and personal by showing the real face, name, and title of the care agent who is speaking. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nThe award-winning T-Mobile team is famous for care because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re constantly looking for ways to improve and personalize the customer experience. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re proud to be the first company to deliver an even more personalized experience through Twitter custom profiles.\nCallie Field\nExecutive Vice President of Customer Care, T-Mobile\nAccording to our research, personalized experiences with a human connection can create significant benefits for businesses. 77% of people are likely to recommend a brand following a personalized customer service interaction on Twitter. Additionally, people are 19% more likely to feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve reached a resolution and 22% more likely to be satisfied compared to those who had impersonal interactions with a business on Twitter.\nWhile T-Mobile uses custom profiles to highlight the human aspect of their service, custom profiles also create the opportunity for businesses to add personality to automated experiences by incorporating real or fictional characters, like branded bots. Custom profiles can help people identify when they are speaking to a human versus not, which helps manage their expectations about the types of replies they might receive.\nThe new versions of our Direct Message APIs, currently in private beta, now include support for custom profiles. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a business looking to enable custom profiles in Direct Messages please let us you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested here.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive global event that brings more than 100,000 people together for the latest in mobile technology. The devices at the heart of #MWC17 are also at the heart of Twitter, which connects a growing global audience to what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Happening\nWhether you want to find out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world of politics, the latest trends during London Fashion Week or what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening on the ground at #MWC17, Twitter is the best way to keep up with the things you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re most interested in and passionate about. This is why it is listed as the number 1 News App on the App store in Spain, France, the UK and many other countries.\nWhat people love about Twitter is what we love about it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an open, public and live platform where people get to hear about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world fast. And we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t only mean breaking news first, we also mean the conversation and memes that often follow global stories everyday.\nLive Video\nOver the last year we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working to redefine what \u00e2\u0080\u009clive\u00e2\u0080\u009d means on Twitter. We started with Periscope, integrating it into Twitter with the live button and making it easy for anyone to share an experience in real-time. People have transported us to breaking news stories, celebrations and monumental moments. We added to that by offering people the opportunity to make what they share even more immersive with live 360 video.\nWe have also taken Live Video further by streaming premium content, which combines with the power of Twitter conversation. From the NFL, to 6 Nations rugby games, to market coverage from Bloomberg, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find it live on Twitter. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also bringing more live moments from our content partners, like top-flight football coverage from Sky Sports. All great opportunities for brands to be a part of the moment.\nDiscovery Mindset\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really unique about the people on Twitter is the discovery mindset they have when they come to the platform. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on Twitter looking for great content and stories.\nA discovery mindset means that people on the platform are more attentive, more responsive and more trusting of the content they see on Twitter in comparison to how they are elsewhere. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great news for brands, as it makes for the perfect environment to connect with consumers. In fact, recent neuroscience research results shows that a discovery mindset and video combine very effectively to produce results that massively outperform online norms, making video on Twitter a more effective tool than ever before.\nSee you at #MWC17\nAt #MWC17 we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have some really exciting content to share with you. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be going live throughout the week. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be working with great creators who will be taking you all over the city.

We stand for freedom of expression and people being able to see all sides of any topic. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s put in jeopardy when abuse and harassment stifle and silence those voices. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tolerate it and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re launching new efforts to stop it.\nBuilding on the work we began in November, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re continuing to work on ways to give people more control over what they see on Twitter. Last week, we introduced an improvement to reporting abusive Tweets that gives people experiencing targeted harassment more ways to report it.\nToday, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re announcing three changes: stopping the creation of new abusive accounts, bringing forward safer search results, and collapsing potentially abusive or low-quality Tweets.\nStopping the creation of new abusive accounts: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking steps to identify people who have been permanently suspended and stop them from creating new accounts. This focuses more effectively on some of the most prevalent and damaging forms of behavior, particularly accounts that are created only to abuse and harass others.\nIntroducing safer search results: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also working on \u00e2\u0080\u0098safe search\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which removes Tweets that contain potentially sensitive content and Tweets from blocked and muted accounts from search results. While this type of content will be discoverable if you want to find it, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t clutter search results any longer. Learn more in our help center.\nCollapsing potentially abusive or low-quality Tweets: Our team has also been working on identifying and collapsing potentially abusive and low-quality replies so the most relevant conversations are brought forward. These Tweet replies will still be accessible to those who seek them out. You can expect to see this change rolling out in the coming weeks.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIn the days and weeks ahead, we will continue to roll out product changes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 some changes will be visible and some less so \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and will update you on progress every step of the way.

These NSLs were accompanied by gag orders when they were served (one in 2015, one in 2016), preventing us from notifying the impacted account holders or publicly disclosing their existence. The FBI recently informed us that the gag orders have been lifted and that we may notify the account holders.\nWe have provided each of the account holders with copies of the relevant NSLs (certain information redacted to protect privacy) as well as the account data we were compelled to produce. While the actual NSLs request a large amount of data, Twitter provides a very limited set of data in response to NSLs consistent with federal law and interpretive guidance from the U.S. Department of Justice.\nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraged by the lifting of these two gag orders and those recently disclosed by Cloudflare, Google, the Internet Archive, and Yahoo!. However, Twitter remains unsatisfied with restrictions on our right to speak more freely about national security requests we may receive. We continue to push for the legal ability to speak more openly on this topic in our lawsuit against the U.S. government, Twitter v. Lynch.\nWe continue to believe that reporting in government-mandated bands does not provide meaningful transparency to the public or those using our service. However, the government argues that any numerical reporting more detailed than the bands in the USA Freedom Act would be classified and as such not protected by the First Amendment. They further argue that Twitter is not entitled to obtain information from the government about the processes followed in classifying a version Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2013 Transparency Report or in classifying/declassifying decisions associated with the allowed bands.

The world has seen this with conversations around #BlackLivesMatter, #SheInspiresMe, #LoveIsLove, #OrlandoStrong, #BlackWomenDidThat, and many more. And we are focused on that spirit of inclusion in our workplace.\nThroughout 2016, we implemented practices that advance our commitment, identified and acted on vulnerabilities that prevent it, and partnered with organizations that can help us ensure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re building a diverse and inclusive workforce. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been up to:\nRecognizing the importance of focusing on behaviors that stand in the way of inclusion,we partnered with Paradigm to deliver live inclusion and unconscious bias workshops to our employees around the world. These workshops are facilitated by experts in the field and offer a space for employees to learn about how bias can come into play at work, openly share perspectives, as well as develop strategies and skills for actively managing bias.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe facilitate trainings at a lot of companies. Twitter had a unique interest in tracking the long-term impact of their trainings, allowing us to learn that content designed both to raise awareness and to manage bias resulted in actual behavioral change in employees.\nJoelle Emerson\nCEO of Paradigm\nOur leadership team and Board grew, becoming more representative of the people and communities that use our service. And our CEO, Jack Dorsey, was named the Thurgood Marshall College Fund CEO of The Year.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nReaching and moving beyond our goals also depends on an investment in our people and their growth. So we have piloted new programs focused on the development, visibility, and sponsorship of women and underrepresented minorities in different areas. We recognize the power of the leadership stories of our women, and annually name several as MAKERS. And in 2016, all our open country head positions were filled by women.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe put ourselves where the talent is, and we showed up in force at Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, National Society of Black Engineers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (NSBE) annual convention, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Conference (SHPE). We launched a partnership with CODE2040, focused on minority software engineering students. We updated our career site with a new inclusion and diversity section. To mitigate against unconscious bias and optimize for inclusion, we made strategic changes to our technical interview process, and implemented software-based tools to both increase our candidate pool and improve our job descriptions. We also built out a dedicated university diversity recruiting function to reach more students, creating tailored plans for each region as well as Twitter-specific onsite programs like #FirstFlight for potential university recruits. Our goal is to create an even stronger sense of belonging in our interview process.\nWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t presume to have all the answers. So, we seek to learn from organizations that reach different communities in their day-to-day work or who invest in the next generation of talent. We support ADCOLOR (focused on diversity in creative fields), Tech Women, Lesbians Who Tech, AfroTech, the National Center for Women & Information Technology, and Girls Who Code, to name a few.\nWe expanded how we think about parental responsibilities and leave, updating our policy to provide up to 20 weeks paid leave to all parents globally, regardless of gender or gender identity and inclusive of adoption, natural birth, or surrogacy.\nOur culture of inclusion has been made stronger by our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). Whether influencing how important decisions about the workforce are made, strengthening communities internally, impacting how we show up on and off Twitter, or recruiting diverse talent, ERGs are central to our commitment to inclusion and diversity. They have a total following of close to one million on Twitter, and they engage with these followers regularly as well as invite in communities around us for events and topical discussions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n@TwitterWomen, which in 2016 brought together all women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groups at Twitter, developed our global #SheInspiresMe campaign around International Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day. Thanks to the work of @TwitterAlas (Hispanic and Latinx employees) and @Blackbirds, we brought the community to Twitter during #HispanicHeritageMonth and #BlackHistoryMonth with custom emojis. And because of an initiative by @Blackbirds, our widely recognized emoji for #BlackHistoryMonth lives on following the #PhilandoCastile and #AltonSterling tragedies. @TwitterOpen (LGBTQ employees) helped us achieve an HRC Corporate Equality Index perfect score and receive the Visionary Award by the Trevor Project, focused on anti-bullying initiatives. Following the tragedy in Orlando, @TwitterOpen and @TwitterAlas co-hosted a vigil to create awareness, reflection, and remembrance.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe also introduced two new ERGs: Twitter Parents and Twitter Stripes (supporting our Veteran community). And coming soon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be welcoming a new group supporting Asian employees.\nLastly, we hired an ERG Program Manager to work directly with our ERGs to support their strategies and impact.\nFor 2016, we sought to push ourselves in a distinguishing way and set measurable goals, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy to share that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met or surpassed many of these. With our commitment we have seen progress in hiring and career development, culture, policies and, as a result, increases in overall representation of women and underrepresented minorities.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n*We are also focused on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2016 for the first time, we gave all US new hires the opportunity to self-identify as LGBTQ. While this data collection is new and therefore limited, we wanted those who chose to identify to be counted. Of employees answering, 10% identified as LGBTQ. As more employees respond in 2017, we expect to have a more complete picture.\nWe know that the effects of our actions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many of which were new for 2016 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 cannot be immediate. We are focused on sustained efforts that will help us draw more diverse talent, create great experiences and careers, and foster a culture of belonging that fully lives up to the spirit of community on Twitter itself. And we will continue to come together with and learn from our industry peers, in the spirit of doing better not just for ourselves but for the industry as a greater whole.\nOur commitment to inclusion and diversity is fundamental to who we are and crucial to the effectiveness of our service. One-and-done measurements don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply here, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re again setting representation goals for 2017. Also, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going further by adding a new goal, for underrepresented minorities in non-tech roles.

The public nature of the platform, and the innumerable ways in which it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harnessed for good, motivates employees to lend their talents to initiatives large and small across the world.

Now, because of the perennial character of our volunteering culture, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling these days of service #TwitterForGood Days.

Goals decide the matches, and make the crowd go wild. However, not every goal has equal impact, both in the match and on the fans.\nWith Twitter we can gauge the excitement caused by each goal during #EURO2016 by looking at the spikes in Tweet volume after each goal. The greater the spike, the more reaction it inspired among fans. This visualization shows every goal of EURO, when it happened, who scored it, how it affected the score, and the corresponding reaction on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe used peak detection algorithm to detect spikes and snap goals to the closest spikes. There are many ways we can measure \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcitement\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Using raw number of Tweets could be one way, but we chose to normalized the data such that each goal is measured as a percentage of total Tweets in that game, in order to make the goals comparable across the entire tournament. Otherwise, any goal in later matches will easily beat the group stage goals, as those matches attract many more viewers. However, using percentage overcompensated for the matches with fewer viewers so we had to add another weight to adjust the value based on total volume in a match.\nThe excitement level of a goal can be due to many factors, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in the viz:\nImpact: How much a goal affects the course of the game can determine the reactions to it. Goals that takes the lead are indicated in red, and in general caused more excitement (higher spikes).\nTiming: Goals closer to the end of the game tend (towards the right side of the viz) to have higher spikes. For example, double goals from France duo Griezmann and Payet in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and 90+6\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minutes against Albania.\nBeauty: Slovakia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Marek Hamsik\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thunderous strike from a tight angle against Russia hits the inner post and bounce in.

Quick replies and welcome messages in Direct Messages make it easier for businesses to guide people to better outcomes through a combination of simple automation and human service.\nThese features are designed to help businesses create rich, responsive, full-service experiences that directly advance the work of customer service teams and open up new possibilities for how people engage with businesses on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nIntroducing Welcome Messages and Quick Replies\nWelcome messages let businesses greet people and set expectations as they enter a Direct Message conversation\u00e2\u0080\u0094without requiring people to send the first message. Businesses can create multiple welcome messages and deep link directly to a specific greeting from Tweets, websites, or apps. Welcome messages help businesses demonstrate their commitment to service and help people learn what options exist to engage with a business in Direct Messages.\nQuick replies let businesses prompt people with the best ways to reply to a Direct Message, whether by choosing from a list of options or guiding users to enter specific text values.\nWhen quick replies and welcome messages are used together, businesses can reduce wait times and educate people on the best ways to interact with them. For example, they can enable faster resolutions by helping customers more easily provide information to solve problems before an agent sees the first message, or they can simplify automated services and transactional flows that were difficult in the past.\nConnecting Brands and Consumers Companies including Evernote and Pizza Hut are launching new experiences in Direct Messages that make use of these features.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAt Evernote, it is very important to us that we provide the best possible experience across our channels. We are excited about the new features Twitter has developed. The ability to welcome our valued customers and capture their issues before they contact one of our agents helps to streamline the process, accelerate resolution time and reduce customer effort.\nGerald Hastie\nDirector of Global Customer Service at Evernote\nThe new Pizza Hut social ordering platform is another example of making it easy for our customer to order their favorites from Pizza Hut. We are constantly pursuing ways to simplify our ordering experience.

While it might seem intuitive that customers who get great help will spend more with that business in the future, new research actually quantifies that lift and helps businesses understand how to capture that value. This post shares highlights from our research, as well as tips to help customer service teams take advantage of the findings.\nRequests for customer service emerged as an early behavior on Twitter, and Tweets have become a mainstream method for reaching out to businesses. Millions of people talk to businesses publicly each month via Tweets. To understand the impact of these customer service interactions on customer relationships, we designed a research study in partnership with Applied Marketing Science to figure out the potential revenue benefit to businesses who help their customers via Twitter.\nLate last year, we began this work focused on the US airline industry, which found that customers who received replies from an airline demonstrated stronger satisfaction and recommendation ratings\u00e2\u0080\u0094and were also willing to pay a significantly higher price for a future ticket.\nMore recently, we expanded the project to replicate this research with the US quick service restaurant (QSR) and telecom industries. We found that, similar to the airline industry, customers who received replies were more satisfied with their experience, more willing to recommend the business, and willing to pay more money for that business\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products in the future\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially if the consumer received a response quickly.\nWe used the same rigorous conjoint analysis methodology for all verticals we analyzed.\nResponding to Tweets boosts willingness to spend\nBusinesses create a massive opportunity for themselves when they acknowledge customer service-related Tweets from consumers. When a customer Tweets at a business and receives a response, they are willing to spend 3\u00e2\u0080\u009320% more on an average priced item from that business in the future.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:If you need to discuss a private topic with a person who mentions your business in a Tweet, reply with a Direct Message deep link so you can invite customers into private, 1:1 conversations.Make sure to acknowledge the person appropriately by being personal, friendly and human.\nResponding also increases word of mouth activity, likeliness to recommend, and customer satisfaction\nIn addition to revenue potential, customers who receive service via Twitter will create measurable upper-funnel impact. Customers are 44% more likely to share their experiences\u00e2\u0080\u0094both online as well as offline\u00e2\u0080\u0094after receiving a response from a business on Twitter. Further, they are 30% more likely to recommend the business, and respond an entire point higher (2.66 vs 3.66) on customer satisfaction surveys.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:Learn and grow \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer feedback tools let people privately share their opinions after a service interaction. Businesses can collect customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score\u00c2\u00ae data that can be compared across traditional service channels.\nThe fastest responses generate the greatest revenue impact\nWhile any response is better than none, it pays to reply rapidly. When an airline responded to a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tweet in less than six minutes, the customer was willing to pay almost $20 more for that airline in the future. Similarly, in the telco industry, customers are willing to pay $17 more per month for a phone plan if they receive a reply within four minutes, but are only willing to pay only $3.52 more if they have to wait over 20 minutes.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:Set expectations about being responsive. Twitter has a new support indicator and message button which allow businesses to help people understand when they can expect a response and to make sure they know they have the option to start a private conversation.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of negative Tweets!\nIt turns out that responding to negative Tweets can create major positive impacts. 69% of people who Tweeted negatively say they feel more favorable when a business replies to their concern. And among telco customers, conversations that started with a negative Tweet resulted in higher brand favorability as well as 3X higher willingness to pay for their monthly wireless plan, compared to those whose original Tweet was positive.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:Consider prioritizing responses to negative Tweets over positive Tweets, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ignore customer praise! Any response helps increase willingness to pay, so respond to every Tweet that you can. By responding quickly to negative Tweets, you can maximize your potential for impact.\nCustomer service on Twitter benefits both businesses and customers\nBusinesses might love these benefits, but research shows customer service on Twitter is better for customers, too.Aspect Research found that consumers like coming to Twitter because they perceive it as significantly less frustrating than other customer service channels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even preferring it slightly more than in-person interactions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBusinesses have known for years that great customer service engenders brand loyalty; this research shows a wide range of additional benefits to businesses. And these benefits come at a lower cost compared to other channels: according to McKinsey & Company,support interactions on social cost 1/6th of those in a call center. Combined with the revenue potential, favorability, satisfaction, and recommendation impact of these interactions, businesses can benefit significantly from investing in helping their customers on Twitter.\nMethodology\nA total of 3,139 people who use Twitter completed the conjoint exercises. In addition to people who Tweeted at the top brands, we made sure to include those who had customer service interactions via traditional channels\u00e2\u0080\u0094like 1-800 numbers\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as those who were customers in these industries during the test period but had no customer service interactions on any channel. We then used these results to develop a model that measured exactly how much shoppers valued each brand.\nNet Promoter, NPS, and the NPS-related emoticons are registered trademarks, and Net Promoter Score and Net Promoter System are service marks, of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc. and Fred Reichheld.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nresearch\nmarketing\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

First, we are introducing a new campaign objective in beta, the Website Conversions objective, that is designed to help advertisers drive cost-efficient conversions at scale. Second, we are renaming our existing Website Clicks or Conversions objective to the Website Visits objective to better reflect the actions that this objective drives. This change is to the name only \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the objective will contain the same features and customization options. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPerformance and scale for retargeting campaigns We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built the Website Conversions objective with performance-focused marketers in mind using what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned in working with successful direct response advertisers. The result is a solution that helps Twitter advertisers see better performance and greater scale in campaigns.\nThis solution is especially effective for advertisers who want to retarget website visitors to drive more conversions. Advertisers using this objective to retarget their website visitors on mobile and desktop receive, on average, 2.5X the volume of conversions versus similar campaigns using the Website Clicks or Conversions objective.\nHow it works Website Conversions campaigns use data from Twitter website tags and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest and intent signals to optimize your campaign to deliver more conversions while meeting your cost-per-conversion goal. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reach your audience on Twitter and extend your campaign to thousands of apps and websites so you can drive conversions across devices and environments.\nThese changes build on our investments over the past few years, now making it possible for you to reach your customers and drive conversions everywhere. These include both the ongoing enhancements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made to our website tag to help you more effectively target your audience and measure conversions and to the Twitter Audience Platform to help you reach that audience wherever they are (even if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not logged in on Twitter). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now also leveraging TellApart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in predictive shopping and bidding to help you reach the right audience to maximize conversions on your site.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAdvertiser success In early testing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard positive feedback from conversions-focused clients who have run Website Conversions campaigns: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very pleased with the performance of our Website Conversions campaigns on Twitter and have seen meaningful improvements in both scale and efficiency. Relative to comparable Washington Post campaigns, we are now getting more than 5X as many conversions at a cost per conversion that is 88% below our campaign goal based on internal benchmarks. By using this new objective, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to leverage Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer data signals to reach our customers and drive cost-efficient digital subscriptions across both mobile and web.\nPedram Farsaii\nDigital Marketing Manager, The Washington Post \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used the Website Conversions objective to retarget our website visitors and generate cost-efficient conversions for our business on Twitter. Over the course of our campaigns, our cost per conversion has been 26% below our targets and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to drive new, incremental customer sales across both mobile and desktop.\nNell Lanman\nDigital Marketing Manager, UNTUCKit \nGetStarted The newWebsite Conversions objective is now available in beta to advertisers in the US. Over the coming months, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to make enhancements to this new objective based on your feedback and will look to expand availability to advertisers in additional regions.

Tweeps also trained local businesses on how to use Twitter as a campaigning to raise their profile and secure sales.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nEMEA:\nHands-On NGO Training (Dublin)\n@TwitterDublin kicked off #TwitterForGood Day by hosting a group of NGOs and nonprofit organizations for a training session, where Tweeps covered best practices for campaigning on the platform, reviewed case studies exhibiting success, and then transitioned into a discussion on how the Twitter platform has been able to support and highlight the work of the organizations present.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nProtecting the welfare of animals (Spain)\nIn Spain, animal welfare was the priority of our @TwitterSpain team.

Goals decide the matches, and make the crowd go wild. However, not every goal has equal impact, both in the match and on the fans.\nWith Twitter we can gauge the excitement caused by each goal during #EURO2016 by looking at the spikes in Tweet volume after each goal. The greater the spike, the more reaction it inspired among fans. This visualization shows every goal of EURO, when it happened, who scored it, how it affected the score, and the corresponding reaction on Twitter.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe used peak detection algorithm to detect spikes and snap goals to the closest spikes. There are many ways we can measure \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcitement\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Using raw number of Tweets could be one way, but we chose to normalized the data such that each goal is measured as a percentage of total Tweets in that game, in order to make the goals comparable across the entire tournament. Otherwise, any goal in later matches will easily beat the group stage goals, as those matches attract many more viewers. However, using percentage overcompensated for the matches with fewer viewers so we had to add another weight to adjust the value based on total volume in a match.\nThe excitement level of a goal can be due to many factors, as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see in the viz:\nImpact: How much a goal affects the course of the game can determine the reactions to it. Goals that takes the lead are indicated in red, and in general caused more excitement (higher spikes).\nTiming: Goals closer to the end of the game tend (towards the right side of the viz) to have higher spikes. For example, double goals from France duo Griezmann and Payet in the 90\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and 90+6\u00e2\u0080\u0099 minutes against Albania.\nBeauty: Slovakia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Marek Hamsik\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thunderous strike from a tight angle against Russia hits the inner post and bounce in. Totally worth watching over and over.\nSurprise: Underdog goals seem to also get fans excited and cause outsize reactions. For example, McGinn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal which gave N. Ireland its first win in major tournament, and Iceland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s winning goal in the last match of group stage both had notable spikes.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nHere are some ways you can navigate the viz:\nHover (desktop) / Tap on (mobile) any goal to see all the goals from that match.\nFilter matches by team, to see every goal they scored or conceded throughout the tournament.

Businesses can create multiple welcome messages and deep link directly to a specific greeting from Tweets, websites, or apps. Welcome messages help businesses demonstrate their commitment to service and help people learn what options exist to engage with a business in Direct Messages.\nQuick replies let businesses prompt people with the best ways to reply to a Direct Message, whether by choosing from a list of options or guiding users to enter specific text values.\nWhen quick replies and welcome messages are used together, businesses can reduce wait times and educate people on the best ways to interact with them. For example, they can enable faster resolutions by helping customers more easily provide information to solve problems before an agent sees the first message, or they can simplify automated services and transactional flows that were difficult in the past.\nConnecting Brands and Consumers Companies including Evernote and Pizza Hut are launching new experiences in Direct Messages that make use of these features.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAt Evernote, it is very important to us that we provide the best possible experience across our channels.

While it might seem intuitive that customers who get great help will spend more with that business in the future, new research actually quantifies that lift and helps businesses understand how to capture that value. This post shares highlights from our research, as well as tips to help customer service teams take advantage of the findings.\nRequests for customer service emerged as an early behavior on Twitter, and Tweets have become a mainstream method for reaching out to businesses. Millions of people talk to businesses publicly each month via Tweets. To understand the impact of these customer service interactions on customer relationships, we designed a research study in partnership with Applied Marketing Science to figure out the potential revenue benefit to businesses who help their customers via Twitter.\nLate last year, we began this work focused on the US airline industry, which found that customers who received replies from an airline demonstrated stronger satisfaction and recommendation ratings\u00e2\u0080\u0094and were also willing to pay a significantly higher price for a future ticket.\nMore recently, we expanded the project to replicate this research with the US quick service restaurant (QSR) and telecom industries. We found that, similar to the airline industry, customers who received replies were more satisfied with their experience, more willing to recommend the business, and willing to pay more money for that business\u00e2\u0080\u0099s products in the future\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially if the consumer received a response quickly.\nWe used the same rigorous conjoint analysis methodology for all verticals we analyzed.\nResponding to Tweets boosts willingness to spend\nBusinesses create a massive opportunity for themselves when they acknowledge customer service-related Tweets from consumers. When a customer Tweets at a business and receives a response, they are willing to spend 3\u00e2\u0080\u009320% more on an average priced item from that business in the future.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:If you need to discuss a private topic with a person who mentions your business in a Tweet, reply with a Direct Message deep link so you can invite customers into private, 1:1 conversations.Make sure to acknowledge the person appropriately by being personal, friendly and human.\nResponding also increases word of mouth activity, likeliness to recommend, and customer satisfaction\nIn addition to revenue potential, customers who receive service via Twitter will create measurable upper-funnel impact. Customers are 44% more likely to share their experiences\u00e2\u0080\u0094both online as well as offline\u00e2\u0080\u0094after receiving a response from a business on Twitter. Further, they are 30% more likely to recommend the business, and respond an entire point higher (2.66 vs 3.66) on customer satisfaction surveys.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:Learn and grow \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer feedback tools let people privately share their opinions after a service interaction. Businesses can collect customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score\u00c2\u00ae data that can be compared across traditional service channels.\nThe fastest responses generate the greatest revenue impact\nWhile any response is better than none, it pays to reply rapidly. When an airline responded to a customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tweet in less than six minutes, the customer was willing to pay almost $20 more for that airline in the future. Similarly, in the telco industry, customers are willing to pay $17 more per month for a phone plan if they receive a reply within four minutes, but are only willing to pay only $3.52 more if they have to wait over 20 minutes.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:Set expectations about being responsive. Twitter has a new support indicator and message button which allow businesses to help people understand when they can expect a response and to make sure they know they have the option to start a private conversation.\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be afraid of negative Tweets!\nIt turns out that responding to negative Tweets can create major positive impacts. 69% of people who Tweeted negatively say they feel more favorable when a business replies to their concern. And among telco customers, conversations that started with a negative Tweet resulted in higher brand favorability as well as 3X higher willingness to pay for their monthly wireless plan, compared to those whose original Tweet was positive.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTip:Consider prioritizing responses to negative Tweets over positive Tweets, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ignore customer praise! Any response helps increase willingness to pay, so respond to every Tweet that you can. By responding quickly to negative Tweets, you can maximize your potential for impact.\nCustomer service on Twitter benefits both businesses and customers\nBusinesses might love these benefits, but research shows customer service on Twitter is better for customers, too.Aspect Research found that consumers like coming to Twitter because they perceive it as significantly less frustrating than other customer service channels \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even preferring it slightly more than in-person interactions.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nBusinesses have known for years that great customer service engenders brand loyalty; this research shows a wide range of additional benefits to businesses. And these benefits come at a lower cost compared to other channels: according to McKinsey & Company,support interactions on social cost 1/6th of those in a call center. Combined with the revenue potential, favorability, satisfaction, and recommendation impact of these interactions, businesses can benefit significantly from investing in helping their customers on Twitter.\nMethodology\nA total of 3,139 people who use Twitter completed the conjoint exercises. In addition to people who Tweeted at the top brands, we made sure to include those who had customer service interactions via traditional channels\u00e2\u0080\u0094like 1-800 numbers\u00e2\u0080\u0094as well as those who were customers in these industries during the test period but had no customer service interactions on any channel. We then used these results to develop a model that measured exactly how much shoppers valued each brand.\nNet Promoter, NPS, and the NPS-related emoticons are registered trademarks, and Net Promoter Score and Net Promoter System are service marks, of Bain & Company, Inc., Satmetrix Systems, Inc. and Fred Reichheld.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nTweet\nTwitter logo icon\nTags:\nresearch\nmarketing\nLink copied successfully\nMore from Insights\n5 alternative food trends to add to your plate\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n              and\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Saturday, 10 April 2021\n          \nEmbracing modern customer care without upsetting your CFO\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 13 August 2020\n          \nUsing data from the conversation on Twitter to help detect wildfires\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Wednesday, 24 June 2020\n          \nWhy social data is key for brands in COVID-19\n              By\n              \n  \n  \n            \n            on Thursday, 14 May 2020\n          "}

First, we are introducing a new campaign objective in beta, the Website Conversions objective, that is designed to help advertisers drive cost-efficient conversions at scale. Second, we are renaming our existing Website Clicks or Conversions objective to the Website Visits objective to better reflect the actions that this objective drives. This change is to the name only \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the objective will contain the same features and customization options. \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nPerformance and scale for retargeting campaigns We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built the Website Conversions objective with performance-focused marketers in mind using what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned in working with successful direct response advertisers. The result is a solution that helps Twitter advertisers see better performance and greater scale in campaigns.\nThis solution is especially effective for advertisers who want to retarget website visitors to drive more conversions. Advertisers using this objective to retarget their website visitors on mobile and desktop receive, on average, 2.5X the volume of conversions versus similar campaigns using the Website Clicks or Conversions objective.\nHow it works Website Conversions campaigns use data from Twitter website tags and Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest and intent signals to optimize your campaign to deliver more conversions while meeting your cost-per-conversion goal. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reach your audience on Twitter and extend your campaign to thousands of apps and websites so you can drive conversions across devices and environments.\nThese changes build on our investments over the past few years, now making it possible for you to reach your customers and drive conversions everywhere. These include both the ongoing enhancements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made to our website tag to help you more effectively target your audience and measure conversions and to the Twitter Audience Platform to help you reach that audience wherever they are (even if they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not logged in on Twitter). We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re now also leveraging TellApart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expertise in predictive shopping and bidding to help you reach the right audience to maximize conversions on your site.\nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nAdvertiser success In early testing, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard positive feedback from conversions-focused clients who have run Website Conversions campaigns: \nThis Tweet is unavailable\n          This Tweet is unavailable.\n        \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very pleased with the performance of our Website Conversions campaigns on Twitter and have seen meaningful improvements in both scale and efficiency. Relative to comparable Washington Post campaigns, we are now getting more than 5X as many conversions at a cost per conversion that is 88% below our campaign goal based on internal benchmarks. By using this new objective, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to leverage Twitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customer data signals to reach our customers and drive cost-efficient digital subscriptions across both mobile and web.\nPedram Farsaii\nDigital Marketing Manager, The Washington Post \nWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used the Website Conversions objective to retarget our website visitors and generate cost-efficient conversions for our business on Twitter. Over the course of our campaigns, our cost per conversion has been 26% below our targets and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to drive new, incremental customer sales across both mobile and desktop.\nNell Lanman\nDigital Marketing Manager, UNTUCKit \nGetStarted The newWebsite Conversions objective is now available in beta to advertisers in the US.
